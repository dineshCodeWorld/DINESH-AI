    "title": "2011 Omani protests",
    "content": "The 2011 Omani protests (also called the Omani Spring) were a series of protests in Oman that occurred as part of the revolutionary wave popularly known as the \"Arab Spring\".\nThe protesters demanded salary increases, lower living costs, the creation of more jobs and a reduction in corruption. Protests in Sohar, Oman's fifth-largest city, centered on the Globe Roundabout. One of the responses of the then Sultan Qaboos bin Said was the dismissal of a third of the governing cabinet.\n\n\n== Issues ==\nProtesters demanded salary increases and lower costs of living. On 20 February 2011, protesters welcomed a move by the government to increase the minimum wage. The wage increase targeted Omani workers in the private sector. Public sector Omani employees have received wage increases in the past, but the private sector was so far overlooked. The Government of Oman raised minimum wages for an estimated 150,000 private sector employees to $520 from $364 a month. As protests continued in Sohar the demands were still jobs and political reforms. The protesters also want more jobs, freedom of expression, less government control over the media, political reforms, better living conditions, an abolition of taxes and the trial of all ministers.\nProtesters in Muscat also demanded cabinet ministers not serve more than four years. In several other protests, Omanis furthered their demands by calling for a reduction of foreign workers in order to provide more jobs for Omani citizens by private companies.\n\n\n== Anti-government protests ==\n\n\n=== Muscat protests ===\nAbout 200 protesters marched on 17 January demanding salary increases and lower costs of living. The protest surprised international observers, who have viewed Oman as a \"politically stable and sleepy country.\" Renewed protests termed as the Green March, occurred on 18 February, inspired by the serious unrest in fellow Persian Gulf state Bahrain. 350 people took part in the march, demanding an end to corruption and better distribution of oil revenue. The protesters also carried signs with slogans of support for the Sultan. Police did not intervene in the gathering, and later after the protest took place, Sayyid Ali bin Hamoud bin Ali Al Busaidi, minister of the Diwan of Royal Court, announced that he had handed over the petition calling for reforms submitted by those who participated in the Green March to Sultan Qaboos bin Said. \nOn 1 March, about 50 protesters held a sit-in as well outside the Consultative Assembly to demand political reform and an end to corruption. The group later grew to over 400 people. Protesters also continued to demand the Consultative Assembly be turned into a \"real parliament.\" The protests were reported to be \"peaceful, well-organised and very disciplined.\" Tents had been set up with separate accommodations for men and women. Placards with protest slogans had also been translated into English, French and German for the international media.\nOn 2 April, dozens of protesters staged a sit-in in Muscat, outside the chief prosecutor's office, to demand probes into alleged state abuses after clashes with security forces a day earlier.\n\n\n=== Sohar protests ===\nOn 26 February, nearly 500 protesters gathered around a shopping mall in the industrial city of Sohar, 230 kilometres from the capital Muscat. The protesters stopped traffic and shoppers around the mall premises. The shops in the area including the mall remained closed on 27 February as well.\nOn 27 February, protesters returned in Sohar for a second day, hurling stones at security forces who had cordoned them off. The Royal Oman Police eventually used tear gas and rubber bullets to contain and disperse the protesters. According to witnesses, two protesters were killed.\nOn 28 February, protesters looted and burned a hypermarket in Sohar. The demonstrators also blocked the entrance to Sohar port, where 160,000 barrels of oil derived products are exported. On 1 March protests continued for a fourth day as crowds in Sohar congregated at the Globe Roundabout. Eventually, the Omani army, backed by tanks, peacefully dispersed protesters blocking the Sohar port and cleared them from the main coastal highway linking Muscat to Sohar. The troops later pulled back, though five armoured vehicles continued to watch the square. The Globe Roundabout had been the site of up to 2,000 demonstrators over the past three days.\nAfter reports of multiple deaths, the minister of health of Oman claimed only one person had been killed and 20 wounded.\nA Facebook page entitled \"March 2 Uprising for Dignity and Freedom\" called for further protests in all parts of Oman, beginning on 2 March, and it attracted more than 2,300 users. However, protests only occurred at the Globe Roundabout in Sohar with a smaller crowd of 50 protesters who blockaded the area. Some people had organised community policing groups to prevent more damage. The army also issued a red alert to vacate the area or threatened action. The 'Sohar Citizen Committee",

In addition to the domestic league, the club participated in the FA Cup, Football League Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n\n== Season summary ==\nIn the 1991–92 season, Terry Venables became chief executive, with Peter Shreeves again taking charge of first-team duties. Tottenham were competing in Europe that season, in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, reaching the quarter-final where they were edged out by Dutch side Feyenoord. Gary Lineker, who in November confirmed that he would be leaving Tottenham at the end of the season to play in Japan, scored 28 goals and was voted Football Writers' Footballer of the Year. Still, these goals were not enough to prevent Tottenham from under-performing throughout the campaign, losing 20 games as they finished 15th. The absence of Paul Gascoigne, who was out injured for the entire season before his departure to Lazio in the summer of 1992, was also a major factor in the team's underwhelming season.\n\n\n== Squad ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

It has also won the regular season series three times. Despite these achievements, the club has not been able to make it through to the play-off finals.\nTromsø Storm has been one of the two clubs in the league with the highest attendances on average, with an all-time high in the final match of the 2006/2007 season when a full packed arena saw the team beat the arch rival Harstad Vikings in the final match of the regular season, bringing the team to the top of the league table and winning the league championship. \n\n\n== Honours ==\nBLNO\nWinners (1): 1996–97\n\n\n== External links ==\nEurobasket.com Tromso Storm Page",

    "content": "Corinne Orr (born January 6, 1936) is a Canadian actress. She is best known for her work on the English version of the anime series Speed Racer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOrr became involved in children's theatre beginning at the age of 10 (with her first role being in Alice in Wonderland) after she began taking elocution lessons due to her French accent, and started to develop her repertoire of voices. By the age of 14, she was working at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), as well as acting in stage theaters at the Mountain Playhouse in Montreal and the Crest Theatre in Toronto, working for the Montreal Shakespearian Company and alongside such notables as William Shatner, Christopher Plummer, and Barry Morse. With her solid background on the stage, Orr was hired by CBC Radio for roles in their radio dramas such as Laura Limited. She then moved to CBC Television to portray the character of Suzie the Mouse in the children's soap opera Chez Helene, a bilingual program devoted to teaching children English and French.\n\nFollowing her move to New York City, Orr began working regularly on radio and television, and as a voice artist, having been credited over 200 voice-over roles. One of her first jobs was a continuing role in the daytime soap opera The Nurses; others included voice acting roles in several CBS Radio Adventure Theater and CBS Radio Mystery Theater programs. She also began her lucrative career as spokesperson for a variety of companies in a wide range of radio and television commercials. In addition to commercials, Orr has narrated children's stories, provided voices for several dolls, and recorded numerous audiobooks. She was the voice of the Snuggle bear for 15 years and narrated Aliki Brandenberg's Mummies Made in Egypt for the PBS series Reading Rainbow and participated in a special redubbing of an episode of Late Night with David Letterman. Orr's work as a voice actress included dubbing foreign films (including anime films) and series into English. Her television credits include the English versions of several 1960s-1990s Japanese series such as Marine Boy, where she voiced both male and female leads. She has also worked on American cartoon series such as The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers and Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders, as well as direct-to-video animated films.\nShe remains best known for her work on the English dubbed version of the 1960s anime Speed Racer, where she portrayed Speed's girlfriend Trixie and all of the female characters, as well as the voice of Speed's kid brother Spritle, who had a raspy voice, and which became a hit and a cult title in the United States. Following the release of the compilation film Speed Racer: The Movie, together with a fellow voice actor on the show, Peter Fernandez, she went on Children's Safety Network-sponsored tours around the country with the Mach 5 car in order to promote their campaign for children's safety. Her voice can be also heard in the 2008 Speed Racer live-action film. After the death of Fernandez in 2010, she became the last surviving English-language cast member of Speed Racer.\nOrr judged the Daytime Emmy Awards for 18 years and served on the Screen Actors Guild council for 13 years. She has appeared as a guest of honor at numerous entertainment conventions (often with Fernandez, with whom she has worked together in most of her voice acting roles), including Friends of Old Time Radio, The Hollywood Show, Anime Weekend Atlanta, Zentrancon, Zenkaikon, Anime North, New York Anime Festival, and New York Comic Con. She was featured in Paley Archive's Women in Film series, Anthony Wynn's book Conversations at Warp Speed, and the documentary film Otaku Unite!.

    "title": "Perry County Courthouse (Missouri)",
    "content": "The Perry County Courthouse is a government building for Perry County that lies on the main square in Perryville, Missouri, United States.\n\n\n== Early Structures ==\nFour structures have served as the home of Perry County's courts and administration since Perry County's creation.  The first structure was a temporary home for the court, while the latter three structures were constructed solely to house the county courts and administration.  The first structure was a two-story log building which served as the site of the county court after the creation of Perry County in 1821, and housed the court until a courthouse building could be built in 1826.  The first building solely built to serve as the county courthouse was constructed in 1826 at a cost of $1,486.25. No known photos exist of this building. The first courthouse building of 1826 was replaced in 1861 with a new two-story stone building at a cost of $8,000. The second courthouse building constructed in 1861, however, had eventually fallen into disrepair and was replaced with the third and present brick courthouse in 1903 at a cost of $31,819.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early days before statehood, court sessions took place in private homes or the parish houses.  By 1821, the population of the Barrens and surrounding area warranted the separation of the southeastern portion of Ste. Genevieve County into a new county, Perry County.  After Perry County was organized in 1821, the county court was established on May 21, 1821 in the home of Bede Moore, located two and half miles north of Perryville, by Lewis Cissell, D.L. Caldwell, and Samuel Anderson.  County officials used a two-story log building for conducting county business. At first, there was a delay in building a court house as the population of Perry County had also been obliged to help fund the courthouse in Ste. Genevieve County, as they had been a part of that county.  Commissioners were appointed to locate a seat of justice somewhere in the county, but no move was made toward the erection of a courthouse until 1825. Because of its centrality, population, and location on the historic road between Ste. Genevieve and Cape Girardeau, the area just east of the Barrens was chosen to be the seat of Perry County.  Bernard Layton donated fifty-one acres of his land one-half miles east of St. Mary's Seminary for the site of a county-seat town, Perryville.\n\nIn 1825, it was decided that a more permanent building was needed to house the county court and administration, so a contract was let for the first courthouse. Funding of the $1,486.25 (1825 dollars) project came from the sale of 55 lots of property deeded to the county by Bernard Layton. No known illustrations of the structure exist. By 1859, a growing county created a need for more space. The court appropriated $8,000 (1859 dollars) for construction and appointed John E. Layton as superintendent of the construction. The two-story building was completed in 1861.  The site of the building was on the northeast corner of the square.  The building continued in use until after the turn of the century. Grand jury reports from that time indicated the condition of the building was beyond repair. After county residents presented a petition calling for an election on September 1, 1903, voters approved a proposition for a $30,000 bond issue to finance a new courthouse. From several plans submitted in November, the court selected the proposal of Caldwell and Drake, Columbus, Indiana, who were then contracted for construction.  Construction began in February, 1904.  The cornerstone ceremonies were conducted on June 4, 1904. The total cost on the red brick, 65-by-92-foot building was $31,819. The county continues to use the courthouse for county court and administration purposes.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.\n\n\n== Circuit Court ==\nThe Perry County Court House is home to Perry County, Judicial Circuit 32. \n\n\n== Courthouse Square ==\nThe courthouse is located on the main square in Perryville, and is complete with a chiming clock tower.  On the grounds are a war memorial, civil war memorial, a \"Camino Real\" Marker and a number of other markers. Around the courthouse is the courthouse lawn which features a brick paved plaza, landscaped seating areas, park benches, a sundial, a directional marker and a gazebo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Perry County, Missouri\n\n\n== References ==",

By 1979, Card was a professor at the University of Southern California and director of USC's Planning Institute.\n\n\n== Involvement in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 ==\nAfter completing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, Card became a legislative fellow with Senator Bill Brock of Tennessee. Card's own experience in being denied a credit card and home mortgage fueled her desire to work on legislation prohibiting discrimination in granting credit to women. Senator Brock served on both the National Commission on Consumer Finance and the Senate Banking Committee, but he and others had to be convinced that a problem existed before supporting federal legislation to address the discrimination. Card coordinated with women's organizations (including the National Organization of Women) to compile a report on gender-based discrimination in the banking industry that was supported by thousands of letters from women throughout the United States who had been denied credit. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act was signed into law on October 28, 1974.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nStaying Solvent: A Comprehensive Guide to Equal Credit for Women (1985).

He was considered one of the top running backs in FCS history, being one of only nine players to rush for 1,000+ yards four times .\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Northern Arizona ===\nBaumann played college football for the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) from 2010 to 2013.  He was considered one of the top running backs in the FCS that year.  While at Northern Arizona, he rushed for at least 1,000 yards for all four years of his eligibility, including 1,456 yards and 10 touchdowns as a senior.  He was named to the first team in the Big Sky Conference three times.\n\n\n=== Arizona Cardinals ===\nThe Arizona Cardinals signed Bauman to their practice squad on October 28, 2014. He was signed on December 16, 2014. On May 5, 2015, he was released by the Cardinals.\nIn the preseason of 2014, Bauman scored a touchdown on what was called the \"most bizarre TD of early NFL preseason\" in a game against the Minnesota Vikings.  The play highlighted the rule that the center's snap to the quarterback is considered a backward pass and not a handoff, therefore the dropped ball was not a fumble and could be advanced.  Bauman picked up the ball from the turf and ran it six yards for a touchdown.\nBauman participated in The Spring League in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "Young's operation is a surgery designed for the treatment of atrophic rhinitis, first described by Austen Young in 1967.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nThe surgical procedure involves closure of the nasal cavity affected with atrophic rhinitis by creating mucocutaneous flaps.\nThese flaps are sutured together in two layers: first the mucosal layer, then the skin layer. The nasal cavity is kept closed for a period of 6 months/each; then an examination is done - if the crusts have disappeared, a revision surgery is performed and the nasal cavity is reopened. The theory behind this procedure is that the closed nasal cavity has time to heal.\n\n\n=== Outcome ===\nThe first patient to undergo Young's operation specifically to treat Atrophic Rhinitis was in Sheffield in 1963, by Austen Young, when both nostrils were closed. The patient had a chronic condition causing social ostracism due to the strong odour.   Both nostrils were re-opened in 1965 and the patient has had no problem since then (current as at October 2020).  However, the patient has no sense of smell and inhibited taste (i.e. cannot taste spices/herbs).\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "2002 Giro d'Italia",
    "content": "The 2002 Giro d'Italia was the 85th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro began with a 6.5 km (4 mi) prologue that navigated through the streets of the Dutch city Groningen. The race came to a close with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Twenty-two teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Paolo Savoldelli of the Index Alexia team. Second and third were the American Tyler Hamilton and Italian Pietro Caucchioli.\nIn the race's other classifications, Ceramiche Panaria–Fiordo rider Julio Alberto Pérez won the mountains classification, Massimo Strazzer of the Phonak team won the intergiro classification, and Acqua & Sapone rider Mario Cipollini won the points classification. Alessio finished as the winners of the Trofeo Fast Team classification, ranking each of the twenty-two teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the Trofeo Super Team classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was also won by Alessio.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\nA total of 22 teams were invited to participate in the 2002 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists. Out of the 198 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 140 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe 22 teams that took part in the race were:\n\n\n== Route and stages ==\n\nThe route for the 2002 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 17 November 2001 in Milan. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. In the stages containing categorized climbs, four had summit finishes: stage 5, to Limone Piemonte; stage 11, to Campitello Matese; stage 13, to San Giacomo; and stage 17, to Passo Coe. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was 1.5 km (1 mi) shorter, contained one more rest day, and one more individual time trial. In addition, this race had an opening prologue like the year before.\n\n\n== Classification Leadership ==\n\nIn the 2002 Giro d'Italia, five different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the Cima Coppi), which in 2002 was the Passo Pordoi, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the intergiro classification, marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\n\n\n== Final standings ==\n\n\n=== Minor classifications ===\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Italian Massimo Strazzer won the Most Combative classification. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. The Azzurri d'Italia classific",

He was known as a strong scrummager and his appearances for Rhodesia included matches against the 1962 British Lions and 1963 Wallabies. In 1964, MacDonald captained Rhodesia on a tour of South Africa, after which Northern Rhodesia became independent, and he caught the attention of Springboks selectors. He represented the Springboks on their 1965 tour of Australia and New Zealand, debuting against the Wallabies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, then playing all four Test matches in New Zealand. After the tour, MacDonald retired to his tobacco farm in what was now Zambia.\n\n\n== Lion attack ==\nMacDonald was seriously injured in a lion attack on his farm in 1966. A wounded lion MacDonald had been tracking leapt on him, tearing off part of his ear while it tried to crush his head in its jaws. He had three fingers bitten off when he attempted to grab the lion's tongue to protect his head, before the lion died of its own injuries. Reports vary on how the lion was killed. One account suggests the lion choked on blood from MacDonald grabbing at its throat, rather than having succumbed to wounds received earlier. After being rushed to hospital, MacDonald required over 400 stitches during a six-hour operation.\n\n\n== Murder ==\nIn 1987, MacDonald and his wife Netta were murdered in an ambush at the entrance of their farm near Bulawayo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of South Africa national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Affirmation: LGBTQ Mormons, Families, & Friends",
    "content": "Affirmation: LGBTQ Mormons, Families, & Friends is an international organization for individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, queer, intersex, or same-sex attracted, and their family members, friends, and church leaders who are members or former members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nUnder the name Affirmation: Gay Mormons United, the first Affirmation group was organized on June 11, 1977 in Salt Lake City by Stephan Zakharias (formerly Stephen James Matthew Price) and a group of other Mormon and former-Mormon gays and lesbians at the conference for the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights. Stephan organized the group in response to the suicides of two Brigham Young University students who had undergone shock aversion therapy on the campus.\n\nThe original organization struggled to survive until 1978, when Paul Mortensen, inspired by an article on the group in The Advocate, formed the Los Angeles chapter. Through the influence of the Los Angeles chapter, Affirmation groups began appearing in many cities around the US.Signs saying \"BYU alumni\" and \"Gay Mormon\" were held aloft by the Affirmation group at the 1979 Los Angeles Pride Parade in what was called the first out gay Mormon presence at a pride parade. One of the participants was interviewed on camera wearing a BYU jersey.\n\n\n=== 1980s–1990s ===\nThroughout the late 1970s and 1980s, it was a common LDS Church practice to excommunicate individuals who identified as gay, without distinguishing between attraction and behavior. \nA book by former LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, counseled individuals with \"same-sex attraction\" that they could overcome same-sex oriented sexuality through faithful living. Because of the strong emphasis in Mormon theology on marriage of a man and a woman as a requirement for \"exaltation\" in heaven, it was common for LDS leaders to encourage members who confessed feelings of \"same-sex attraction\" to ignore their feelings and marry a member of the opposite sex based on the belief that this would overcome homosexuality.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Affirmation increasingly became an organization for ex-Mormons. Members and leaders of Affirmation tended to assume that activity in the LDS Church was psychologically damaging, and believed that the focus of the organization should be on helping people to transition out of Mormonism and to protest policies and doctrines of the LDS Church that were seen as harmful to gay people.\n\n1980 – The name was changed to Affirmation: Gay & Lesbian Mormons.\n1980 – Affirmation leaders sought to engage LDS Church leadership but these early attempts at dialog were rebuffed by LDS Church leadership.\n1985 – A small number of members of Affirmation formed a Latter Day Saint church for gays and lesbians known as the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ.\n1998 – In the late 1990s, then-current LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley spoke publicly about gay and lesbian issues in a different way than his predecessors, most famously in an interview on Larry King Live. He used the terms \"gay and lesbian\" and refrained from using harsh rhetoric. He also distinguished between gay or lesbian orientation and behavior, and suggested that gay and lesbian individuals could be members of the church in good standing, so long as they refrained from same-sex sexual activity.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nWith a softening of the church's positions on homosexuality, increasing numbers of Affirmation members were choosing to stay active in and engaged. In the early 2000s, chapters of Affirmation formed in Mexico and in Chile. With the resurgence in the 2010s, Affirmation began to experience new growth in Latin America, with chapters opening in Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Brazil.\nAffirmation quadrupled in active membership. Large numbers of parents and other family members and allies of LGBT individuals began to get involved in the organization. With the participation of entire families, LGBT Mormon teens and youth were a growing segment of the group's membership. Affirmation increasingly took advantage of social media to create community for LGBT Mormons.\n\n2004 – Hinckley acknowledged the possibility that sexual orientation could be innate and determined at birth in another interview.\n2006 – LDS apostle Dallin H. Oaks and member of the Quorum of the Seventy Lance Wickman acknowledged that sexual orientation might not be amenable to change through therapy or personal righteousness, distanced the LDS Church from reparative therapy, and counseled against heterosexual marriage as a \"therapeutic step.\"\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n2011 – Affirmation held its annual international conference in Kirtland, Ohio, an important Mormon historic site, and many Affirmation members experienced the Kirtland conference as a kind of Mormon spiritual \"revival.\"\n2012 – Randall Thacker was elected president of Affirmation, emphasizing the idea that individu",

    "content": "The Kneisel Quartet was a string quartet founded in 1885 by violinist Franz Kneisel, then concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It continued to perform until 1917, and was generally considered the leading string quartet of its time in the United States.\n\n\n== Origin and history ==\nThe Kneisel Quartet was founded in 1885, soon after Franz Kneisel arrived in Boston as concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The original members of the quartet were all members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and this remained true, in spite of changes in personnel, until 1903, when the players resigned from the orchestra in order to devote their time and energy exclusively to chamber music. In 1905 they moved from Boston to New York City, where Kneisel had accepted a position at the recently created Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School of Music). The quartet gave its final performance on 3 April 1917 in New York. In a statement announcing their retirement, Kneisel explained that henceforth he planned to devote himself to teaching and he wanted to avoid any decline in the quality of their performances.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nFirst Violin:\n\nFranz Kneisel (1885–1917)\nSecond violin:\n\nEmanuel Fiedler (1885–1887)\nOtto Roth (1887–1899)\nKarel Ondříček (1899–1902)\nJulius Theodorowicz (1902–1907)\nJulius Röntgen (1907–1912)\nHans Letz (1912–1917)\nViola:\n\nLouis Svećenski (1885–1917)\nCello:\n\nFritz Giese (1885–1889)\nAnton Hekking (1889–1891)\nAlwin Schroeder (1891–1907)\nWillem Willeke (1907–1917)\n\n\n== Repertoire and reputation ==\nThe Kneisel Quartet played an important role in the growth of appreciation for chamber music in the United States, and in the spread of European standards of performance and programming. The quartet adopted an uncompromisingly serious approach in their playing and choice of repertoire, making \"no concessions to public ignorance\". In place of the popular selections and excerpts from larger works that many audiences were familiar with, they regularly played complete quartets by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and they introduced to American audiences many compositions that are now part of the classical repertoire, but were then new and unfamiliar, including works by Brahms, Dvořák, Smetana, Franck, Debussy, Ravel, and Schoenberg. They also played many contemporary works by American composers, such as Edward MacDowell, Arthur Foote, and George Chadwick, and were exceptionally supportive of the work of women composers and musicians, such as Amy Beach and Bertha Tapper, with whom they sometimes performed. The quartet toured widely and gave concerts in small towns across North America that had rarely, if ever, heard a professional instrumental ensemble playing serious works from the chamber repertoire. It was occasionally criticized for not playing more accessible music, and even in Boston and New York its concerts were not always well attended, but by the time of its retirement the Kneisel Quartet was widely credited with having created a more educated and appreciative audience for chamber music in the United States. As the New York critic Richard Aldrich wrote in 1917, \n\nThe interest in chamber music, the appreciation of the highest possibilities of its performance, the knowledge of many of the greatest compositions in this form of art were cultivated to the highest point by the Kneisel Quartet. There were earlier workers in the field, pioneers to whom honor and credit are due, and who shall not be forgotten. But the Kneisel Quartet reached a higher level than was attained by any of them, and has exercised a correspondingly greater influence. It has been one of the  greatest forces for good in the musical history of this country. \n\n\n=== Selected first performances ===\nBrahms, String Quintet No. 2. First American performance, 6 November 1891.\nLoeffler, String Sextet. World premiere, 15 December 1893, New York,\nDvořák, String Quartet no. 12 (\"American\").

He graduated from the Riga Realschule (now the Riga 1st State Grammar School) and entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg (1906). At the Academy he studied painting under Leon Benois and architecture under Ivan Fomin. From 1911 Rudnev was a success in various architectural competitions, and in 1915 he became a certified specialist in the art of architecture.\nAfter the February Revolution Rudnev won the competition for the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution on the Field of Mars in Petrograd (March 1917). The avant-garde monument there was built according to his design.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Lev Rudnev took active part in reconstructing the ruined cities of Voronezh, Stalingrad, Riga and Moscow. In 1922–1948 Rudnev was a Professor of the Academy of Arts (former Imperial Academy of Arts) in Leningrad; in 1948–1952 he was a professor at the Moscow Architectural Institute. Rudnev was also a member of Academy of Architecture of the USSR.\nRudnev's most remarkable architectural work is the ensemble of the Lomonosov Moscow State University on Sparrow Hills, then known as Lenin Hills (1948–1953, co-designed with S. Chernyshyov, P. Abrosimov, A. Khryakov, and engineer V. Nasonov). His Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, Poland (1952–1955) resembles the markedly sculptural style of the MSU ensemble.\n\n\n== Projects ==\n\nHe was the author of many large scale Soviet projects, including:\n\nM.

    "title": "Information activism",
    "content": "Information activism at libraries and among librarians began in the 1960s, when many libraries advocated for the information rights of their clients. Their activism projects thereafter extended beyond library walls to advocate for issues such as tenancy and labour rights. With the advent of new information technologies and the information explosion of the late 20th century, information activism expanded in scope to include people who utilize information in the service of advocacy.\nAn information activist is someone who works to make information available to the general population. According to Anthony Molaro, \"An information activist is a vigorous advocate of knowledge gained through study, communication, research or instruction\".\nTactical Technology Collective has proposed a definition of information activism as \"the strategic and deliberate use of information within a campaign\" which specifically refers to the use of publicly available information in activist projects. Information activists take on many projects to work to remove barriers and provide access to knowledge for all people. \nInformation activism can take on many different forms and be used in many different fields including in librarianship, in archiving, and in activist projects.\n\n\n== In librarianship ==\nCarla Hayden was quoted describing librarians of today as people \"who are activists, engaged in the social work aspect of librarianship ... Now we are fighters for freedom, and we cause trouble! We are not sitting quietly anymore.\"\n\n\n=== Library Juice Press ===\nLibrary Juice Press is a publisher that specializes in theoretical and practical issues in librarianship from a critical perspective, for an audience of professional librarians and students of library science. They began as the webzine and blog Library Juice and still hold no affiliations to an academic institution.  Some topics they investigate are: library philosophy, information policy, library activism, and in general anything that can be placed under the rubric of \"critical studies in librarianship.\" \nLibrary Juice Press is an imprint of Litwin Books, LLC.\n\n\n== In archiving ==\nInterference Archive is a collectively-run archive in Brooklyn, New York that opened in December 2011. The Archive \"explores the relationship between cultural production and social movements.\" They are a volunteer driven archive whose mission is to bring attention to and honour the history of activist movements, which are often ignored by mainstream institutions. Their collection includes books, prints, music, moving images, and ephemera that were produced by various social movements. Since 2011, Interference Archive has expanded their collection of activist materials, hosted sixteen public exhibitions, written four publications, given over one hundred talks and workshops, and held various film screenings.\n\n\n== In activist projects ==\nThe Tactical Technology Collective is an nongovernmental organization that works to \"advance the use of information and digital technologies by advocates and activists worldwide\"  The organization runs a number of information activism projects including the 10 Tactics for Turning Information into Action, 10 Tactics Revisited, and the Info Activism Camp. Their two 10 Tactics campaigns are both a film and a project which aims to link the ways in which information and information technologies have been used in social movements. In particular, information is used to \"monitor the state, corporations, and powerful social institutions,\" hold them accountable, and promote local and global activism. The Info Activism Camp exists as space to bring together activists from around the world to develop information activism techniques.\n\n\n== See also ==\nData activism\nInformation criticism\nInformation wants to be free\nInformation war\nLibrary and information science\nZine\nFree culture movement\nFreedom of information\nLibrarians Without Borders\nOpen data\nRadical Reference\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLibrarians Without Borders\nLIS Wiki\nLibrary Juice Press\nInterference Archive\nTactical Technology Collective\n10 Tactics: for turning information into action\n10 Tactics Revisited\nInfo Activism Camp 2013",

    "content": "The Codex Sarzanensis, or Codex Saretianus, designated by j or 22 (in Beuron system), is a 5th or 6th century Latin Gospel Book. The text, written on purple dyed vellum in silver ink (as are codices a b e f i), is a version of the old Latin. \nDated by paleographists to the beginning of the 6th century, the manuscript is formed by 72 sheep leather scrolls with parts in gold (or silver) characters, and precious miniatures realized in Tyrian purple dye, firstly scanned as a whole in 2018.\nThe best conserved sections contain Luke 24 and 292 verses of John (1:38-3:23; 3:33-5:20; 6:29-49.49-67; 6:68-7:32; 8:6-9:21), written two columns on a page, in round  letters. John 18:36-20:14 was written by another hand. It has numerous lacunae. \nThe manuscript was discovered in 1872 in the Church of Sarezzano, near Tortona. It was edited by librarian of the Ambrosian Library in 1872 at Milan (2nd edition, 1885). It was edited by Jülicher.\nThe codex is no longer housed at the Church of Saints Ruffino & Venanzio at Sarezzano, but is kept and displayed at the nearby Museo Diocesano d'Arte Sacra di Tortona (\"Tortona Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art\"), in Tortona, Alessandria Province. Only a few pages of the text are displayed at any given time given the delicate nature of the text and the bulk of the work is deposited at a nearby bank under preservative conditions. \nAccompanying the text at the museum are items which were discovered with the text upon its removal from the which include the remains of a previous leather binding of the text with holes in the shape of a cross which at one point may have held precious stones and cover of a wooden box which held the book, beautifully painted with a portrait of St. Ruffino.\nThe museum can be visited by appointment for a small donation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New Testament Latin manuscripts\nPurple parchment\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA.

    "content": "The President of Iran is the highest official elected by direct, popular vote, although the President carries out the decrees, and answers to the Supreme Leader of Iran, who functions as the country's head of state. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates. Powers of the presidency include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations, with Supreme Leader's approval; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs, as decreed by the Supreme Leader. The President also appoints the ministers, subject to the approval of Parliament.\nCandidates have to be vetted by the Guardian Council, a twelve-member body consisting of six clerics (selected by Iran's Supreme Leader), and six lawyers (proposed by the head of Iran's judicial system and voted in by the Parliament).\nThe Guardian Council interprets the term supervision in Article 99 as \"approbation supervision\" (Persian: نظارت استصوابی) which implies the right for acceptance or rejection of elections legality and candidates competency. This interpretation is in contrast with the idea of \"notification supervision\" (Persian: نظارت استطلاعی) which does not imply the mentioned approval right. The \"evidentiary supervision\" (Persian: نظارت استنادی), which requires evidences for acceptance or rejection of elections legality and candidates competency, is another interpretation of mentioned article.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "The Dongfeng-26 or DF-26 (simplified Chinese: 东风-26; traditional Chinese: 東風-26; lit. 'East Wind-26'; NATO reporting name: CH-SS-18) is an intermediate-range ballistic missile of the Dongfeng series deployed by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force and produced by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).\nChinese sources claim the DF-26 has a range of over 5,000 km (3,100 mi) and may conduct precision nuclear or conventional strikes against ground and naval targets. It is China's first conventionally-armed ballistic missile claimed to be capable of reaching Guam and the American military installations located there; this has led to the missile being referred to as the \"Guam Express\" or \"Guam Killer\".\nThe possibility that a DF-26 unit could have nuclear warheads makes it likely an adversary would target these missiles in a first strike. This weapon advances military goals from a brinkmanship policy to a calibrated escalation.\nThe missile was officially revealed at the 2015 China Victory Day Parade. In April 2018, it was officially confirmed that the DF-26 was in service with the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). The United States believes the missile was first fielded in 2016, with 16 operational launchers in 2017.\n\n\n== Tests and deployments ==\nOn 26 August 2020, along with a DF-21D, a DF-26B was launched into an area of the South China Sea between Hainan and the Paracel Islands, one day after China said that an American U-2 spy plane entered a no-fly zone without its permission during a Chinese live-fire naval drill in the Bohai Sea off its north coast (the US confirmed a U-2 sortie but denied it was improper.) and came as Washington blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military activities in the South China Sea. US officials subsequently claimed that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had fired four medium-range ballistic missiles in total. The missile tests drew criticism from Japan, the Pentagon and Taiwan and led to volatility in Asian markets. As of 2019, the DF-26 has not been tested against targets at sea.\nA missile test range located in China's Taklamakan Desert is used for the development of the DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missile. The facility, which is a component of the People's Liberation Army's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy, includes full-scale mock-ups of U.S. naval assets, such as a Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers . Some of these targets are mounted on rail systems to simulate movement. This test site is used to refine the DF-26's guidance systems and terminal-stage sensors, supporting its capability to engage and destroy naval vessels.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nDF-26\nDF-26B\nDF-26D: a variant of DF-26.

In 1780, Major Christopher Carleton led a raid that set fire to everything but the homes of Loyalists.\nCharlotte County, of which Kingbury was a part, was annexed by the Vermont Republic in 1781. The following year, it renounced its claim to Charlotte County, and New York officially recognized the town of Kingsbury. In 1810, the settlement near Baker's Falls incorporated as the village of Sandy Hill, though it changed its name to Hudson Falls in 1910.\nIn 1823, the Champlain Canal was opened, followed in 1833 by the Glens Falls Feeder Canal.

From 1932 to 1943 he was married to Dorothy Schiff, with whom he co-owned the Post.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nThe son of a Russian emigrant who became a wealthy builder in Manhattan, Backer tried his hand at several careers before becoming a playwright and producing several Broadway plays. Although he spent most of his life as a Democrat, he joined the American Labor Party shortly after its founding and was its candidate for New York's 17th congressional district in 1937 and 1938. After the death of City Councilman Baruch Charney Vladeck, Backer was chosen by the ALP to succeed him. He was sworn in on December 6, 1938, and served until the end of 1939. He did not run for re-election.\nIn the 1930s, Backer supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in his election campaigns, and traveled to Europe on several occasions to help Jews flee Nazi Germany. During World War II, he served as propaganda policy director for the Office of War Information. In addition to his work with the Post, he served as president of the American ORT Federation from 1938 to 1950 (also succeeding Vladeck) and as president of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency from 1935 to 1950.\nBacker died on May 1, 1974, in Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.\n\n\n== Works ==\nAppearance of a Man.

    "content": "\"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" (pronounced [əsˈbəidia(ɨ) ˈhəɨlɔɡ]; English: \"Sunny Intervals\") is the twelfth single by Super Furry Animals. It was the only single to be taken from the album Mwng and was released as a limited edition 7\" vinyl on the band's own Placid Casual label on 1 May 2000. It was the band's first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. The Welsh language song has been described by singer Gruff Rhys as \"throwaway pop\" and likened to the music of ELO, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes.\nCritical reaction to the track was generally positive with some reviewers comparing the song to the work of Roxy Music. The track appears on 2004's singles compilation album Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1 but is not included on the DVD release as no music video was made.\n\n\n== Themes and recording ==\nSinger Gruff Rhys has described \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" as \"throwaway pop ... old time pop music\", likening the song to the work of ELO and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 1960s pop bands such as The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about \"looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment\" and that \"If there's any song that doesn't sum up [Mwng] it's ['Ysbeidiau Heulog']!\" The track was recorded in 1999 at Famous Studios, Cardiff and was engineered by Greg Haver. Overdubs were added at Ofn studios, Llanfaelog, Wales with the help of Gorwel Owen who also mixed the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. B-side \"Charge\" was recorded for an episode of BBC Radio 1's The John Peel Show, which aired on 1 March 2000. The track was produced for the BBC by Simon Askew and engineered by Nick Fountain.\n\n\n== Musical structure ==\n\n\"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" is 2 minutes 51 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody, which plays twice, accompanied by drums, bass, distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone. The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines \"Fe gawsom ni, ysbeidiau heulog, ysbeidiau heulog\" with a vocoder being used on the second \"ysbeidiau heulog\". This entire phrase is then repeated, with Rhys accompanied by harmony backing vocals. Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums. The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar, playing the chords B, B, A and E twice with little sustain, joining the drums and bass, which is no longer distorted. The track breaks down for the first chorus with Rhys singing \"ysbeidiau heulog\" four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional keyboard noises with the band rejoining on the last \"heulog\", the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the word's two syllables which are emphasised by cymbal crashes. After a drum fill an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds. This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once during the second half of the section, simply feedingback for the first half. The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhys' vocals. A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing \"Oedd ein cariad ni, heulog tan ddaeth glaw yn llif\". Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar, featuring flanging, playing several licks alongside bass and drums, which are heavily affected by flanging. The bridge leads into the third and last chorus, which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature flanging. The track ends with an instrumental outro similar to the intro. The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a wah-wah effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone. After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to fade out.\n\n\n== Release and critical response ==\n\"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" was released as a limited edition 7\" vinyl single on the Super Furry Animal's own Placid Casual label on 1 May 2000. It was the band's first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. It received a generally positive response from critics. The track was awarded 'Single of the Week' in the May 10–16, 2000 issue of the Melody Maker by guest reviewers the Dum Dums who gave the song a perfect five-star rating and claimed that it is a \"summery, karaoke-pop hit\". Pitchfork Media called \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" the best track on parent album Mwng and described it as a \"decidedly retro number that combines the swingin' sounds of the '60s with some high-tech vocal effects\". In a 2006 feature on the Super Furry Animals' back catalogue Incendiary Magazine called the track a \"clever slice of pop\". In a play on words on the track's meaning in English, Drowned in Sound stated that \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" was Mwng's \"sunny interv",

    "title": "Chrispim Jacques Bias Fortes",
    "content": "Chrispim Jacques Bias Fortes (25 October 1847 – 14 March 1917), often referred to as Bias Fortes, was a Brazilian politician and prosecutor who served as president of Minas Gerais in the early years of the First Brazilian Republic. During his administration the new state capital, Belo Horizonte, was inaugurated in 1897, replacing Ouro Preto.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nThe son of Francisco José de Oliveira Fortes, a captain in Brazil's National Guard, and Carlota Benedita de Oliveira Fortes, Bias Fortes was born on 25 October 1847 in the Livramento (currently the municipality of Olivera Fortes), Minas Gerais. His name is a homage to Saint Crispin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Greek philosopher Bias of Priene.\nBias Fortes completed his first studies in Barbacena and later moved to São Paulo to study at the Faculty of Law, where he graduated in Legal and Social Sciences in 1870, alongside Joaquim Nabuco, Ruy Barbosa, Afonso Pena and Rodrigues Alves. After finishing his studies at the Faculty of Law, Bias Fortes returned to Minas Gerais, where he began to work as an attorney in Barbacena. In October 1871, he was appointed public prosecutor in the district of Parahybuna and later became a municipal judge in Barbacena.\nBias Fortes married Adelaide de Araújo, who was the daughter of major João Manoel de Araújo, an important figure in the Liberal rebellions of 1842. Together they had 3 children: José Francisco, who would later become governor of Minas Gerais, Maria Alice, and Laurita.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Provincial deputy ===\n\nIn 1879, Bias Fortes requested his dismissal from his office as magistrate and began his political career, joining the Liberal Party. In 1881, he was elected provincial deputy of Minas Gerais for the remainder of the 23rd legislature (1880–1881), being successively reelected until the 27th legislature (1888–1889). During this period, he occupied the position of president of the Provincial Assembly several times, distinguishing himself in the defense of Minas Gerais' interests and the moralization of public administration. \nAmidst the growing republican movement in the Brazilian Empire in the 1880s, Bias Fortes declared himself a republican and resigned his position as provincial deputy in 1888, before the end of the 27th legislature. The next year he once again ran for the position. However, despite receiving a considerable number of votes, he was prevented from taking office due to the coup d'état that proclaimed the republic in Brazil. At that time, Bias Fortes had already joined the Republican Party of Minas Gerais (PRM), founded in 1888.\n\n\n=== President of Minas Gerais ===\nWith the republic in place, Bias Fortes was invited by state president João Pinheiro to create the draft for the state's constitution. Shortly after, he was appointed provisional president (governor) of Minas Gerais by president Deodoro da Fonseca, serving consecutively from 24 July to 5 August 1890, 14 August to 3 October 1890, 18 October to 27 December 1890, and 7 January to 11 February 1891, being succeeded by Frederico Augusto Álvares da Silva.\n\nBias Fortes was elected to the Minas Gerais Constituent Assembly on 25 January 1891, directly acting in the creation of the state constitution. He also served as president of the State Senate from 1891 to 1893. In 1894, Bias Fortes resigned his position in the Senate after being elected president of Minas Gerais on 7 March and taking office on 7 September, succeeding Afonso Pena. As president of Minas Gerais, Bias Fortes sought to promote agriculture, immigration, and the settlement of interior lands. He also reformed agricultural and veterinary teaching and invested in railway construction. On 12 December 1897, Bias Fortes inaugurated the new state capital, Belo Horizonte, replacing Ouro Preto.\n\n\n=== Final years and death ===\nBias Fortes was succeeded by Silviano Brandão on 7 September 1898. That year he assumed the presidency of the PRM's executive committee, known as Tarasca, a position he held until 1917.\nBias Fortes died in Barbacena on 14 March 1917 during his office as state senator.\n\n\n== Homages ==\nBias Fortes lends his name to several avenues and squares in Belo Horizonte and Barbacena. In Belo Horizonte's Liberdade Square there is a monument in his honor. Likewise, in the city's Municipal Park there is a monument to the \"founders of Belo Horizonte\", which includes Bias Fortes, alongside Augusto de Lima, Afonso Pena and Aarão Reis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAssembleia Legislativa do Estado de Minas Gerais (1991). \"Perfis mineiros: Crispim Jacques Bias Fortes\" (PDF).

    "content": "\"Dream Away\" is a song by the English rock musician George Harrison written for the film Time Bandits (1981), and subsequently released on his tenth studio album Gone Troppo (1982). The song is featured over the end credits of Time Bandits, a production of Harrison's HandMade Films directed by Terry Gilliam. \"Dream Away\" was also issued as a single in Japan in February 1983.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\"Dream Away\" was to originally appear on a planned Time Bandits soundtrack album. When that failed to materialise and Harrison was finalising the tracks for his Gone Troppo album, he decided to include \"Dream Away\".\nIn the documentary film George Harrison: Living in the Material World (2011), directed by Martin Scorsese, Gilliam recalled that late in the production of Time Bandits he came to see the song's lyrics as \"notes\" from Harrison on the things he liked and disliked about the film and on how Gilliam was \"too arrogant and not listening!\" Gilliam added: \"And I thought it was the most brilliant, subtle, clever thing a man could ever do, to write a song. He's writing about things that he felt strongly about and yet he's too polite and decent and, I think, respectful of other artists, whatever form that takes, to interfere.\"\n\n\n== Release and critical reception ==\nAlthough Gone Troppo was a commercial failure, \"Dream Away\" became a popular tune. People magazine's reviewer paired it with \"Wake Up My Love\" as the album's two \"lovelies\" and commented that \"Because of his forays into the mystical, Harrison's penchant for whimsy often gets overlooked. But here the zany side gets no short shrift.\"\nWriting in Goldmine magazine shortly after Harrison's death in November 2001, Dave Thompson said that while Gone Troppo was a far from essential album by the artist, \"Dream Away\" was a track that \"stand[s] alongside any number of Harrison's minor classics\". In 2010, AOL Radio listeners voted \"Dream Away\" at number 8 on the station's list of the \"10 Best George Harrison Songs\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nGeorge Harrison – lead vocals; guitars; backing vocals\nMike Moran – piano; synthesizer\nAlan Jones – bass\nDave Mattacks – drums\nRay Cooper – percussion\nBilly Preston – backing vocals\nSyreeta – backing vocals\nSara Jones Recor Fleetwood – backing vocals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeorge Harrison – Dream Away (Time Bandits) on YouTube",

    "title": "Music of Greenland",
    "content": "The music of Greenland is a mixture of two primary strands, Inuit and Danish, mixed with influences from the United States and United Kingdom.\nGreenland's musical character has been described as \"definitely a rock country, both musically and literally\" according to Greenlandic drummer Hans Rosenberg.  The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes all Greenlandic music except the drum dances as influenced by external styles.\n\n\n== Folk music ==\nThe Inuit and the Danish peoples of Greenland have both maintained their distinct styles of folk music. Country-wide folk traditions included storytelling, which declined greatly after the introduction of the South Greenland Printing Press in 1857.\nTraditional music which has best survived European contact can be found in the east and northeast of the island. It includes sacred drum dances played on an oval drum made of a wooden frame with a bear-bladder on top.  Drum dances are the \"only truly indigenous music\" in Greenland, and are part of a roots revival in modern times. Shamans used drums as part of their religious affairs and sometimes organized singing duels between rivals in which the performer who got the most laughs from the audience won. Inuit drum dances were a declining tradition and in modern Greenland are being replaced by amateur theater groups like Silamiut, who used elements of indigenous music with masks, face painting and other techniques.\nPiseq are a form of personal song that comment on daily life; these are often handed down from generation to generation. Greenlandic Inuit folk songs are performed to tell stories, play games and tease or charm others.\n\n\n=== Inuit music ===\n\nThe Inuit of Greenland share a musical tradition with related peoples across the Canadian territories of the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, as well as the US state of Alaska and part of eastern Russia. Greenlandic Inuit are part of the Eastern Arctic group; the Eastern Arctic Inuit of Canada and Alaska are part of the same music area as the Central Arctic Inuit, as opposed to the distinct styles of the Western Inuit.\nGreenlandic Inuit music is largely based around singing and drums, the latter being generally reserved for large celebrations and other gatherings. Though there is much folk vocal music, there is no Inuit purely instrumental tradition with no accompaniment by singing or dancing. Greenlandic drums are mostly frame drums made of animal skin stretched over a wooden frame and decorated with decorative and symbolic motifs by the drummer. Aside from drums, whistles, bull-roarers and buzzers are also widespread, and the jaw harp and fiddle are both found, most likely recent imports.\nHistorical recordings of this music are done since 1905. This traditional Greenlandic music is performed also today.\n\n\n==== Drum dances ====\nGreenlandic drum dances are, like the relatives found in Eastern and Central Canada, based around a single dancer who composes songs sung by his family while he dances, usually in a qaggi, a snow-house built just for community events such as the drum dance. The men's drum dancing skills are evaluated by his endurance in his lengthy performance and the nature of his compositions. Drum dances are an important element of Greenlandic Inuit cultural cohesion, and function as personal expression, pure entertainment and social sanction.\nMany drum dances are competitive in nature, featuring two song cousins who humorously sing and dance, while pointing out the flaws in the other. This is generally a light-hearted, convivial event, but is also sometimes used to settle serious duels between warring families or individuals; the jokes are prepared ahead of time and the person who evokes the most laughter from the audience is considered the victor.\n\n\n==== Other Inuit folk song traditions ====\nMany Inuit folk games revolve around song as well, including string games, hide-and-seek, juggling and rhymes and riddles. The katajjaq tradition is also well-known; it is a vocal contest between two women, standing facing each other. They sing songs, using throat-singing and imitating animal cries or other sounds. Katajjaq is a game, but is often stopped because both women begin laughing.\nIn addition to the drum dance and game songs, Greenlandic Inuit have a tradition of piseq (piserk, personal song) songs. These are expressive, spiritual, superstitious or narrative and may be composed for drum dances. Piseq and other vocal traditions aside from song games include a number of styles and tones, which vary depending on the social context of the performance. For example, a soft vocal tone is used both for character illustration in a narrative song and for personal songs in private settings. Many songs use only a few real words, interspersed among numerous vocables, or non-lexical syllables like ai-ya-yainga. Inuit songs are strophic and mostly use six different pitches; textual and melodic motifs are common. A song's word length and accentuation determines the rhy",

    "title": "Illegal Pete's",
    "content": "Illegal Pete's is a Colorado-based group of quick-service, fast-casual \"Mission Style\" burrito restaurants that takes inspiration from burritos popularized in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Illegal Pete's location was opened up by Pete Turner on August 15, 1995, on The Hill in Boulder; Turner said that starting the business nearly killed him. Since then, the business has grown to include seven locations in Denver, two in Boulder, one in Fort Collins, and two in Arizona, one in Tucson and one in Tempe. Turner seeks old, historic buildings to transform into his locations and has done so with places like Mama's Cafe, and the vintage shop at Main Gate. The corporate headquarters of Illegal Pete's was in the historic Denver landmark, the Daniels & Fisher Tower in downtown Denver and now is located in a loft on Broadway near their S. Broadway restaurant.\nThe restaurant has become popular with hipsters, college students, athletes, and musicians nationwide: in fact, international pop songwriter Jack Johnson first received the call saying Universal Records wanted to sign him while he was eating a burrito at Illegal Pete's.\nIn 2014, Illegal Pete's attracted controversy from proponents of Race Forward's \"Drop the I-Word\" campaign, which seeks to eliminate the word \"illegal\" from American vernacular because of possible racial connotations. Two small groups of Latino activists demanded that the word \"illegal\" be dropped from the name of the restaurant, first in Fort Collins and again upon the opening of the Tucson location. Founder Pete Turner has refuted any possible racial connotations of his business name in the media and in a public statement defending the use of the word.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nIllegal Pete's is involved in several facets of community involvement, including charity fund raisers like the \"Smother Autism\" campaign in April 2012, which raised money for The Joshua School, \"a Colorado-based, non-profit educational therapeutic day treatment center for children with an autism spectrum disorder and related developmental disabilities,\" or the award-winning Pete's Pints campaigns, which raise money for local bands.\nIn September 2010, Illegal Pete's started the Starving Artist program, which feeds out-of-town musicians for free at Illegal Pete's when they come through Denver or Boulder to play a show. Illegal Pete's was voted as the Best Place to Eat and Hang Out with Rock Stars by the annual Best of Westword of 2011. Illegal Pete's began throwing Starving Artist SXSW showcases in Austin in March 2011. Pete Turner was featured in a front-page article of the Denver Post on businesses spending marketing money on representing Denver at SXSW.\nIn July 2011, Illegal Pete's launched \"Greater Than\" artist collective, a non-traditional record label that works with Colorado bands. The label was the brain child of Pete Turner and Suburban Home Records owner for 17 years, Virgil Dickerson. Bands signed to the label included Denver darkwave band Snake Rattle Rattle Snake, cello prog pop songwriter Ian Cooke, active rock Denver darlings The Epilogues, the belovedly crass comedian Ben Roy, and songstress Esmé Patterson.\nTravel Channel's Food Paradise aired a segment August 26, 2014 about the restaurant.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "title": "Elizabeth (band)",
    "content": "Elizabeth was an American psychedelic rock/progressive rock band that were active from 1967 to 1970. They were based out of Philadelphia and known for their unique musical and sonic blend of baroque, classical, folk, American rock, British rock, country, and ragtime.  Elizabeth's members were: Steve Weingarten (lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), who died in 2007; Bob Patterson (rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals); Jim Dahme (flute, lead and backing vocals); Steve Paul Bruno (bass, organ, backing vocals); and, Hank Ransome (drums).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1968, the band recorded and released their self-titled album on Vanguard Records (produced by Sam Charters). Vanguard's artist roster at the time included Joan Baez, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Country Joe and the Fish. Elizabeth performed with Cream, Blue Cheer, Joni Mitchell, Ritchie Havens, The Chambers Brothers and many other musical luminaries of that era. Some of the bands' many Philadelphia area performances included concerts and sets at: The Main Point, The Second Fret, The Electric Factory, and most Be-INs at Belmont Plateau in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park.\nAs the band was starting to come together (nameless at that point), Steve and Robert \"Stewkey\" Antoni, bandmates from Newport, RI, made an unexpected stop in Philadelphia on their way to Florida. After a week in the City of brotherly love, they decided to forgo Florida and help form Elizabeth. Some interesting guitarists auditioned for the band, including future rock star Todd Rundgren who was with Woody's Truck Stop at the time; and, Nick Jameson, soon to be a founder and guitarist of The American Dream (both were Philly bands). Within a month or so of landing in Philadelphia, Stewkey left Elizabeth to join Todd's new band, The Nazz. Of note, Linda Cohen, a Philadelphia classical guitarist, was Elizabeth's first drummer (briefly). During the spring and summer of 1969, she teamed up with Michael Kac from Mandrake Memorial and, together, performed as a classical-pop fusion guitar-harpsichord duo. Linda died in 2009 of lung cancer. Mandrake Memorial and Elizabeth shared the stage many times.\n\n\n== Post-Elizabethan life ==\nAfter Elizabeth disbanded in 1970, the band's members pursued various musical and non-musical endeavors. Hank went on to play with the group Good God. Steve began a recording/engineering career that kicked off at Vanguard and Electric Lady Studios. Bob moved to Florida and is quite active to this day as a Singer, Songwriter, Storyteller and Visual Artist. Linda Cohen recorded 3 albums (1971-1973) that were produced by Craig Anderton from Mandrake Memorial. Stewkey recorded 3 albums with The Nazz (1968-1971).\nThe Elizabeth album was re-mastered from the original tapes and re-released on CD in 2000 by the Akarma Vanguard label. The release comes housed in a mini album-styled sleeve that perfectly reproduces the original records foldout cover graphics. The popular Elizabeth track, \"You Should Be More Careful\", appears on the 2010 Vanguard album release (2-disk vinyl set) entitled \"Follow Me Down: Vanguard's Lost Psychedelic Era (1966-1970)\" along with tracks by The Vagrants, The 31st of February and other Vanguard artists.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nSteve Weingarten - lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals\nBob Patterson - rhythm guitar (6 and 12-string), lead and backing vocals\nJim Dahmne - flute, lead and backing vocals\nSteve Paul Bruno - bass guitar, Hammond B-3 organ, backing vocals\nHank Ransome - drums, percussion\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Elizabeth ===\nLP = Vanguard Records VSD-6501, Stereo, 1968\nCD = Akarma Vanguard VMD-6501, Stereo, 2000, remastered from original tapes\nProduced by Sam Charters for Vanguard Records\nSongs Written by Weingarten (1, 3, 4, 6); Patterson (2, 5, 8, 10); Dahme (9);  Weingarten & Dahme (7)\n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "Herborn (Dillkreis) station is a railway station in the town of Herborn in the German state of Hesse on the Dill Railway (built as part of the former Deutz–Gießen railway). The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 4 station.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe station was built as a station on the Deutz–Gießen railway. Services over the whole line commenced on 12 January 1862.\n\n\n== Entrance building ==\nThe entrance building was built in the Renaissance Revival style and is built next to the post office and the two buildings together dominate the station forecourt. The design is by the architect Ludwig Hoffmann. The building was built in 1908 after a great fire in 1904 and replaced the original building of 1862. The station building of 1908 is thus a building of the \"second generation\" of structural engineering on the line. It had become necessary because the old station building was no longer sufficient with the opening of two branch lines.\nThe station building is built to an asymmetrical floor plan. It is dominated by a rugged, slate-covered roof. On the street side is the facade with eccentrically mounted, large arched windows dominated by an outstanding Renaissance Revival gable. This is the location of the entrance from the street. The station building is now listed as a monument under the Hessian Heritage Act.\nThe station building is still partly occupied by a restaurant and a retail kiosk. Tickets can be purchased at the kiosk and from vending machines. The station building has been extensively refurbished since 2015.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe station has a “home” platform (next to the station building) and an island platform with two faces. Another island platform together with two tracks, previously served traffic on two now disused branch lines, which were adjacent to the east. The tracks have been dismantled and the area now forms an industrial wasteland.\nToday, the station is served by Regional-Express trains on the Siegen–Gießen–Frankfurt route (Main-Sieg-Express, RE 99) and Regionalbahn services on the Dillenburg-Frankfurt route (Mittelhessen-Express, RB 40, running as stopping trains between Dillenburg and Gießen). The public transport is operated under contract to the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV) by DB Regio and Hessische Landesbahn.\nPreviously the station was served by two other lines:\n\nservices on the Aar-Salzböde railway from Niederwalgern started and ended here from 1902 to 2001,\nservices on the Cross Westerwald Railway (Westerwaldquerbahn) to Montabaur started and ended here from 1906 to 1980.\nThe station is no longer staffed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLandesamt für Denkmalpflege Hessen, ed.

    "content": "The Fazil examination is a government examination held in Aliya Madrasas in Bangladesh and India. The Fazil exam is an examination equivalent to a degree, sometimes equivalent to a bachelor's degree, in Bangladesh, which is held in a Fazil Madrasa. However, in India, the Fazil exam is considered the standard of the higher secondary level (11th or 12th class). The Fazil exam is common in government-recognized Aliya Madrasas in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The Fazil exam in Bangladesh is held under the Islamic Arabic University and the Fazil exam in India is held under the West Bengal Board of Madrasah Education.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the transfer of Dhaka Aliya Madrasa to Dhaka in 1947, the Fazil examination of Bangladesh and India was held under the Calcutta Aliya Madrasa. The Fazil examination is currently held under the Islamic Arabic University. It was previously held under the Madrasa Board and the Islamic University. When Madrasa-e-Alia was transferred to Dhaka in 1948, the Fazil examinations of the Madrasa Board were accepted by the Dhaka University. On the recommendation of the Qudrat-e-Khuda Education Commission in 1975, the national curriculum and multi-faceted curriculum were introduced in the Aliya Madrasas controlled by the Madrasa Board. This curriculum was implemented in the Fazil examination held in 1980. According to this education commission, the Fazil examination was declared equivalent to the general higher secondary H.S.C. by including Islamic education in the Fazil category along with the general curriculum.\nIn 1978, the Senior Madrasa Education System Committee was formed under the leadership of Professor Mustafa Bin Kasim. Under the guidance of this committee, the level of Alia Madrasa education controlled by the Bangladesh Madrasa Board was aligned with the general education level in 1984. The Fazil level was upgraded to a 2-year course, introducing a complete modern education system of Alia Madrasa lasting a total of 16 years. It was through this commission that the government declared the Fazil examination as the general degree standard.\n\n\n== University affiliation ==\nUntil 2006, all the examinations of all Aliya Madrasas in Bangladesh were controlled by the Bangladesh Madrasa Education Board. According to the Islamic Universities Amendment Act, 2006, the Fazil (Bachelor's Degree) courses of Aliya Madrasas were planned to be of 2 to 3 years duration. 1,086 Fazil Madrasas (Bachelor's Degree) in Bangladesh were affiliated to the Islamic University of Kushtia. And in some cases, both the Fazil and Kamil examinations are considered equivalent to a full bachelor's degree in general education, in some cases only the Fazil examination is considered equivalent to a bachelor's degree. Islamic University, Kushtia In 2010, a bachelor's degree equivalent course was introduced in 31 notable madrasas in Bangladesh. As a result, students from these 31 madrasas had the opportunity to earn a full bachelor's degree by completing only the bachelor's degree. At that time, the bachelor's degree course was still running in these madrasas.\nThen, in 2016, the Islamic Arabic University was established to further modernize madrasa education. And then the Alia madrasas were moved there. In 2016, the Islamic Arabic University introduced undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in 21 more madrasas. \n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "Ibrahim of Ghazna (b. 1033 – d. 1099) was sultan of the Ghaznavid empire from April 1059 until his death in 1099. Having been imprisoned at the fortress of Barghund, he was one of the Ghaznavid princes that escaped the usurper Toghrul's massacre in 1052. After his brother Farrukh-Zad took power, Ibrahim was sent to the fortress of Nay, the same fortress where the poet Masud Sa'd Salman would later be imprisoned for ten years.\nFollowing Farrukh's death, Ibrahim was recognized as the last surviving male Ghaznavid. A military escort was sent to fetch him from Nay and he entered Ghazna on 6 April 1059. Ibrahim's reign was considered a golden age for the Ghaznavid empire, due to the treaties and cultural exchanges with the Great Seljuq empire.\n\n\n== Life ==\nIbrahim was born during his father's campaign into Gurgan and Tabaristan (c. 1033). He reportedly had 40 sons and 36 daughters. One of these daughters married the great-great-grandfather of the historian Juzjani.\nIbrahim's son, Mas'ud, married Gawhar Khatun, daughter of Seljuq sultan Malik Shah, as a condition of peace between the Great Seljuq empire and the Ghaznavid empire.\nEvery year Ibrahim would copy the Quran by hand and send it to the caliph in Mecca.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nIbrahim rebuilt towns and settlements and instituted a vigorous policy for the restoration of social peace and economic prosperity in the Ghaznavid empire, which had been initiated by his brother Farrukh-Zad. At an unknown time, Ibrahim also arrested his vizier Abu Sahl Khujandi for unknown reasons. In 1060, at the request of the nobles of Ghur, Ibrahim invaded the region and deposed its ruler Abbas ibn Shith. He then had the latter's son Muhammad ibn Abbas placed on the Ghurid throne.\nIbrahim sent his son, Mahmud, with an army of ghazis consisting of 40,000 cavalry to raid Doaba in the eastern Punjab, between 1063 and 1070. Following Mahmud's successful campaigns into India, Ibrahim initially appointed him governor of India. He occupied temporarily  the cities of Agra and Kannauj. He also attacked and captured Malwa. However, for reasons unknown, Mahmud fell out of favor, was imprisoned in the fortress of Nay and his brother, Mas'ud, took his place as governor of India. Shorn of its western land, it was increasingly sustained by riches accrued from raids across Northern India, where it faced stiff resistance from Indian rulers such as the Paramara of Malwa and the Gahadvala of Kannauj.\nAfter 14 years of peace with the Seljuks, Ibrahim, in January 1073, sent an army into Sakalkand. His army met with initial success, capturing Seljuk sultan Malik Shah's uncle, Usman Chaghri Beg, who was sent to Ghazna. However, an army led by the Seljuk Amir Gumushtegin Bilge Beg and Anushtegin Gharchai, drove out the Ghaznavid army that had devastated Sakalkand. In 1077/8, Ibrahim appointed Abd al-Hamid Shirazi as his vizier.\nIn 1079, Ibrahim led a campaign into India, besieging a fortress in Pakpattan 120 Parasang (480 miles) from Lahore, taking it on 13 August 1079. The military commander at Lahore, Abdul Najam Zarir Shaybani, carried out successful raids against the Hindu cities of Benares, Thanesar, and Kannauj. Another main achievement of Ibrahim's reign was the rise of Lahore as a great cultural center under the viceroyalty of his grandson Shirzad.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIbrahim died on 25 August 1099 ending a reign of 40 years. His tomb lies in the northeastern part of medieval Ghazna near Shaikh Radi d-Din 'Ali Lala's tomb in the Palace of Sultan Mas'ud III.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBattle of Ghazni\nHussain Shah\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

    "content": "Cassius V. Cook (1879– March 1, 1950) was an American anarchist activist, writer and publisher.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCook grew up in Iowa before moving to Chicago and then California. He studied pharmacy at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Francisco.\nHe was an associate of Emma Goldman, raising her bond when she was arrested in San Francisco in 1909 after she came to the city for a series of lectures and debates organized by the San Francisco Social Science League, of which Cook was a member. He later accompanied her to Seattle as part of a lecture tour. When the San Francisco Free Speech League was formed after Goldman's arrest, he became its secretary. The involvement of Cook and others in Goldman's defense was said to have \"invigorated [Goldman] with a new sense of mission.\"\nHe contributed writing to Mother Earth and was arrested for opposition to the First World War.\nHe later settled in Vancouver, British Columbia where in 1913 he was secretary-treasurer of the Miners' Liberation League and worked for the Dr. Bell Electro Appliance Company from 1913 to 1916 according to city directories.\nLater in the decade, he edited The Libertarian Magazine in Seattle.\nIn 1919, Cook was head of the Chicago office of the International Workers' Defence League and was involved in organizing to free or win a retrial for Thomas Mooney, who had been convicted and sentenced to death—commuted to life in prison—for the San Francisco Preparedness Day Bombing.\nBetween the World Wars, Cook was a member of the anarchist Libertarian Society in Los Angeles. He was described as a \"large, florid, and bombastic\" man, who \"wrote resolutions for meetings and conventions.\"\nLater in life, he was an advertising executive and secretary of Rocker Publications, which printed and promoted the work of Rudolf Rocker. \nHe was living in Los Angeles when he died on March 1, 1950, and was survived by his wife Sadie, a sister, and two brothers. His death was also noted by a short obituary in the London-based Freedom, an anarchist fortnightly newspaper. His papers are part of the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Seyhan River",
    "content": "The Seyhan River (formerly written Seihan, Sihun; ancient name: Ancient Greek: Σάρος, Sáros), alternatively known as Sarus (or in Turkish as Sarus Su), is the longest river of Cilicia and  the longest of Turkey that flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The river is 560 kilometres (350 mi) long and flows southwest from its headwaters in the Tahtalı-Mountains (in Sivas and Kayseri provinces) in the Anti-Taurus Mountains to the Mediterranean Sea via a broad delta. Its main tributaries are Zamantı and Göksu, which unite in Aladağ, Adana to form the Seyhan River. The Zamantı River originates from the Uzun Plateau in Pınarbaşı, Kayseri and crosses Tomarza, Develi and Yahyalı districts in Kayseri.\nIts sources were reported being in the Taurus Mountains in Cataonia. It flowed through Cappadocia by the town of Comana, then through Cilicia. It is noted by numerous ancient authors including Livy, Xenophon, Procopius, Strabo, Ptolemy, Appian, Pliny the Elder, and Eustathius of Thessalonica who erroneously calls it Sinarus.\nAt 50 kilometres (31 mi) from its mouth, Seyhan River flows through the city of Adana, the only settlement situated on the river. Several bridges and footbridges cross the river in Adana including the Stone Bridge, a 2nd-century Roman bridge. Ancient city of Augusta was also situated on the river, corresponding today to the east side of the Çatalan reservoir. The river meets the Mediterranean Sea at Cape Deli. Its basin is the mountainous Seyhan Basin.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAn ancient Greco-Roman legend mentions that the name of the city of Adana originates from Adanus, the son of the Greek god Uranus, who founded the city next to the river with his brother. His brother's name, Sarus, was given to the river.\nOriginally, the River Sarus flowed from the mountains, became the Seyhan River whilst passing through Cilicia and then onwards to the Mediterranean Sea.\nIn 2009, a total of 33 fish species were listed as being found in the Seyhan River, including 29 native, 3 introduced and 4 endemic species. Eight amphibians were listed and two of them (Rana holtzi and Triturus vittatus cilicensis) are known to be endemic to the river.\nThe major Seyhan Dam upstream of Adana serves for irrigation, hydroelectric power, and flood control. Yedigöze, Çatalan and Kavşak Bendi are the other dams on Seyhan River which also serve the same purposes. The river is currently under extensive development for hydroelectric power and irrigation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStone Bridge (Adana)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

    "title": "Cold Harbor (Severance)",
    "content": "\"Cold Harbor\" is the tenth episode and season finale of the second season of the American science fiction psychological thriller television series Severance. It is the 19th overall episode of the series and was written by series creator Dan Erickson and directed by executive producer Ben Stiller. It was released on Apple TV+ on March 20, 2025. \nThe series follows employees of Lumon Industries, a biotechnology corporation that uses a medical procedure called \"severance\" to separate the memories of their employees: at work, Lumon employees, called \"innies\", can't remember anything outside of work. Outside work, Lumon employees, called \"outies\", can't remember anything about work. As a result, innies and outies experience two different lives, with distinct personalities and agendas. In the episode, Mark's outie and innie move forward with their plan to rescue his wife Gemma from Lumon.\nUpon its release, \"Cold Harbor\" received acclaim for the performances (especially Adam Scott), direction, twists, tension, emotional weight, and closure to the season. The episode is considered as one of the best episodes of the series. At the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, Stiller received a nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series whilst Scott submitted the episode to support his Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the birthing cabin, Mark's outie and innie communicate with each other by recording messages with a camcorder and having Mark walk in and out of the severed room to respond. \nMark's outie, Devon and Cobel explain the plan to rescue Gemma from the testing floor and use the evidence of her kidnapping to take down Lumon. Mark's innie argues that reintegration will result in him losing his identity and autonomy; he grows agitated when he realizes that since Helena would never reintegrate with her innie Helly, taking down Lumon would effectively mean ending Helly's life. Cobel reveals to Mark's innie that every MDR file he completes creates a new innie for Gemma, and that Cold Harbor is the last, after which Lumon will extract Gemma's chip from her brain, killing her in the process. When she insists that Mark is merely being used by the Eagans and has no future with Helly, Mark storms off, demanding to reawaken on the severed floor.\nThe next day, Dylan returns to find that his outie has deferred a decision on his resignation request to him, saying his existence makes him feel happy. Mark arrives on the severed floor and completes the Cold Harbor file with Helly by his side. Milchick and an animatronic statue of Kier Eagan congratulate Mark. During the congratulatory ovation to Mark S, Kier Egan's Animatronic starts to demoralize Milchick, going as far as calling him \"Seth\". Milchick performs with a marching band from the Choreography & Merriment department. Helly distracts Milchick and traps him in the bathroom while Mark searches for the elevator to the testing floor. Dylan arrives at MDR and helps Helly hold off Milchick by barricading the bathroom door with a vending machine.\nGemma enters the Cold Harbor room, where her new innie is tasked with disassembling the crib Mark had built for their baby. To the delight of Dr. Mauer and Jame Eagan, this does not trigger any emotions in her innie. Meanwhile, Lorne brings a goat to a secret room across from the exports hall, where Mr. Drummond is waiting; the goat, chosen for how well it embodies Kier's core principles, is a sacrifice that will be buried alongside Gemma. Drummond provides Lorne with a cattle stunner to kill the goat but is distracted by the sound of Mark attempting to break into the exports hall. Drummond tries to strangle Mark but is stopped by Lorne, who threatens him with the cattle stunner. They fight until Lorne subdues Drummond.\nHolding Drummond hostage with the cattle stunner, Mark takes him to the elevator down to the testing floor; during the transition to his outie, Mark accidentally activates the cattle stunner, killing Drummond. Mark's outie locates the Cold Harbor room, uses his tie soaked in Drummond's blood to enter the room via biometric authentication and frees Gemma. Upon exiting the room, Gemma reverts to her outie and tearfully reunites with Mark. They escape back up to the severed floor, transitioning again to their severed identities. Mark's innie guides Ms. Casey to the exit stairwell where she transitions back to Gemma, but he decides not to join her, instead returning to Helly. Gemma cries for Mark as he and Helly run off into the hallways, holding hands.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe episode was written by series creator Dan Erickson, and directed by executive producer Ben Stiller. This marked Erickson's seventh writing credit and Stiller's 11th directing credit.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nDan Erickson said that in an earlier version of the script, they would expand more about the content behind the \"Cold Harbor\" file. However, they decided to keep it unknown as the answer to its conte",

She is best known for her work on the uneven bars, where she is a two-time world champion (2021, 2022), the 2022 Asian champion, and a two-time Chinese national silver medalist (2021, 2022). In the all-around, she is the 2021 Chinese National Games champion and the 2020 Chinese national silver medalist. On the junior level, she is a three-time Junior World Championships medalist and the 2019 National Youth Games all-around champion.\n\n\n== Junior gymnastics career ==\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nIn February Wei competed at the WOGA Classic in the United States where she placed thirteenth in the all-around but recorded the third highest score on the balance beam.

    "title": "McGill station",
    "content": "McGill station is a Montreal Metro and Réseau express métropolitain (REM) station in the borough of Ville-Marie in the downtown core of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Metro station is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The REM station is operated by Pulsar, and is served by all REM branches.\nThe Metro station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. Since November 2025, the station is also served by the Réseau express métropolitain (REM).\nIt is currently the second busiest station in the Metro network, as measured by number of passengers entering the system (after Berri–UQAM station). Prior to 2002, it was the busiest station in the network.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nDesigned by Crevier, Lemieux, Mercier and Caron, it is a normal side platform station built in open cut under boul. De Maisonneuve, with two ticket halls joined by corridors that surround the platforms. The station is named after, and is located adjacent to McGill University.\nThe ticket halls are linked to the platforms by four stairways per platform, including the shortest escalators in the network. The station has large pillars, which were originally painted orange, but painted in beer bottle green colour in the late 1990s. In January 2010 the STM repainted the station in its original colours being orange pillars and yellow walls.\nAs an important part of the underground city, the station has had its mezzanine level substantially enlarged since its opening, by construction of new buildings around the station: the western end of the mezzanine was added with the construction of the Tour BNP and Eaton Centre, while the southern corridor between the ticket halls was added to link the Promenades de la Cathédrale (now known as Promenades Cathédrale) with the station. \n\nNo fewer than six buildings are directly connected to the station via underground city. The station has a further six direct street-level entrances, all of which are integrated into the façades of other buildings. A seventh entrance in a separate building was added in 2023 to provide elevator access, making the station accessible.\nAmong this busy station's amenities include several shops and services directly in the station, including a Tim Hortons, Second Cup, a Scotiabank, two Pizza Shops, a web terminal, and MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train. This was second station after Berri–UQAM to have them installed.  At one time an \"open-concept\" branch of the Montreal Public Library was located next to the exit onto rue Université.\n\n\n== Renovation and upgrade works ==\nIn March 2012, the station underwent renovation work that included the replacement of Travertine tiles covering surfaces of the whole station, spanning over 1,835 square metres (19,750 sq ft). Other work included replacing the lighting system, fixing columns, beams, and concrete slabs and replacing granite staircases and handrails. By the end of 2016, modernized signage has been put in place, flooring has been completely replaced and the stained glass installation underwent a restoration and was put back in place.\nIn 2020, work began on making the station universally accessible, ahead of the arrival of the REM. The project involves the construction of a new entrance building, two elevators, new public artwork and refurbishment of three of the other entrances. This was estimated to cost around $58 million.\nOn April 3, 2023, McGill became the 26th accessible metro station in the network, with the completion of the refurbishment work.\n\n\n== Réseau express métropolitain station ==\n\nIn November 2016, CDPQ Infra announced that the proposed Réseau express métropolitain (REM) system would connect to the Green line at McGill. As with the 1980s Line 3 proposal, the REM uses the historic Mont Royal tunnel to head north from downtown. The REM station is located under McGill College Avenue, and a pedestrian tunnel connects it to the Green Line station concourse, as well as the wider Underground City. CDPQ Infra indicates that the station will be the 2nd busiest station on the REM, with over 25,000 passengers per day.\nConstruction on the McGill REM station began in September 2018. In this location, the Mont Royal tunnel is not bored through solid rock, and therefore work to strengthen the historic tunnel was required. The REM station opened on 17 November 2025.\n\n\n== Entrances ==\nThe station has seven entrances:\n\n690, De Maisonneuve Ouest\n640, De Maisonneuve Ouest\n811, De Maisonneuve Ouest\n2055, Robert-Bourassa Boulevard\n2021, Avenue Union\n1445, Av. Union and La Baie\n705, De Maisonneuve Ouest (elevator access)\n\n\n== Architecture and art ==\n\nThis station contains several pieces of artwork.\nThe most prominent is Nicolas Sollogoub's Montreal Scenes Circa 1830, depicting the industrial era in the city as well as its early mayors and civic arms. This set of five stained-glass murals was donated by Macdonald Tobacco,",

    "title": "Hirschholm Palace",
    "content": "Hirschholm Palace, also known as Hørsholm Palace, was a royal palace located in present-day Hørsholm municipality just north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It was rebuilt in the Baroque style in the 1740s and, one of the finest buildings of its time, it became known as the \"Versailles of the North\".\nIt developed a notorious reputation in connection with its role in the affair between Johann Friedrich Struensee and Queen Caroline Mathilda in the 1770s. After that it fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1809–1813.\nThe palace was designed by Lauritz de Thurah for King Christian VI and his consort Queen Sophie Magdalene, and was intended as their summer residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nHirschholm Palace was built on a site that had been used since the Middle Ages. From around 1100 there was a fortification at site known as Hørningsholm. In 1391 the estate became crown land when Queen Margrete I took possession of the property. At the end of the 16th century, Frederik II and Christian IV built a royal hunting lodge on the site. The estate, which covered a large area (the present-day municipalities of Hørsholm, Karlebo, Birkerød and a part of Allerød) was called the Noble Estate of Hørsholm (adelsgodset Hørsholm), and was endowed to various noblemen and members of the royal court.\nBy the middle of the 17th century, a royal tradition had developed whereby the ruling king bestowed Hørsholm Palace to his consort, and it was used as a summer residence. The estate was now being managed directly by the royal house, and income went to the Queen.\nFrederick IV’s consort Queen Louise owned Hørsholm Palace between 1700 and 1721. She had it modernised and added a number of farm buildings to the estate.\n\n\n=== The Baroque palace ===\n\nImmediately after he became king in 1730, King Christian VI donated Hirschholm to his queen consort, Sophie Magdalene, as a life estate. Thus began a new phase in the history of the site. The queen decided that the old castle should be converted into a decent summer residence for the king and queen. Until the takeover, conditions at the place had been modest, in fact it was a medieval facility where only a few modernizations had been made. The de Thurah-designed baroque palace was completed in 1744 and was one of the most impressive building works of that period. It was referred to as \"The Versailles of the North\". When the king died in 1746 it became Sophie Magdalene's residence as Queen Dowager. She carried out a number of changes on the estate that pointed towards the agricultural reforms that would come to play a big role in the country during the coming decades.\nThurah's drawings of the palace were published in Den Danske Vitruvius in 1746–1749.\nThe Dowager Queen Sophie Magdalene died in 1770, and the palace was taken over by King Christian VII who used it as a summer residence for his family and court. On 17 June 1771 the royal family and court took summer residence at the palace, and on 7 July Queen Caroline Mathilde gave birth to her second child, Princess Louise Augusta, whose father was almost certainly Johann Friedrich Struensee. That summer has come to be referred to as the \"Hirschholm Summer\" in Danish history.\n\n\n=== Neglect and demolition ===\n\nAfter that summer, and after the arrest of Struensee and the Queen on 17 January 1772, and the subsequent execution of Struensee, and the banishment and imprisonment of the Queen, the palace stood empty until 1810. At that time Frederik VI had the now dilapidated palace torn down for use as build materials for the rebuilding of Christiansborg Palace, which had burned to the ground in the fire of 1794.\n\n\n== The site today ==\n\nIn 1822-23 a small church designed by architect Christian Frederik Hansen was built on the grounds of the demolished palace. The park surrounding the church, which is located on a small island in a lake, still bears some evidence of the original palace garden. A number of the farm buildings Queen Louise had built in the early 18th century still exist. Some of them formerly housed the Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry.\nThe Hørsholm Local History Museum has a permanent exhibit about the palace, the royal affair and its consequences.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles and palaces in Denmark\nList of Baroque residences\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nRosted, H.C.

    "title": "Ak Bars Kazan",
    "content": "Hockey Club Ak Bars (Russian: Ак Барс, Tatar: Ак Барс, English: Snow Leopard), also known as Ak Bars Kazan, is a professional ice hockey club based in Kazan, Russia. It is a member of the Kharlamov Division in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded as Mashstroy Kazan in 1956, the name was later changed to SC Uritskogo Kazan when it entered the Soviet Class B league in 1958. It was promoted to Soviet Class A2, where it gained promotion to the top tier of Soviet hockey. Kazan's performance was respectable, starting the season by winning 6 out of 19 games against the best of the Soviet teams before falling away in the second half of the season and was demoted. Twice they won the USSR League (lower tiers), being named Champion of Russia in 1962 and 1976.\nSC Uritskogo Kazan's most successful period occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Uritskogo Kazan became Itil Kazan in 1990 and participated in the IHL. Itil was only mildly successful, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Vysshaya Liga in 1991 and 1992.\nIt was following the establishment of the Russian Superleague (RSL) in 1996 that the golden age of hockey in Tatarstan began. Renamed Ak Bars Kazan after the traditional symbol of the Tatars, the snow leopard. Benefiting from the resources boom in the Urals, Ak Bars began its history in fine form, finishing first in their respective divisions in 1997 and 1998 along with winning the RSL in 1998.\nIn the 2004–05 season, Kazan signed 11 National Hockey League players, including Russian superstars Alexei Kovalev and Ilya Kovalchuk and Canadians Vincent Lecavalier and Dany Heatley, in an attempt to celebrate Kazan's 10th anniversary with a championship. They did not succeed, however, as a lack of continuity and chemistry saw them finish in fourth place and were upset in the first round of the playoffs by Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. Since then, Ak Bars Kazan dominated the RSL, winning the league in 2006. In 2007, Kazan paced the league with 35 wins and 214 goals in 54 games before falling at the final hurdle to Metallurg Magnitogorsk.\nAk Bars has been led in recent years by the dominant \"ZZM\" line of Sergei Zinovjev, Danis Zaripov, and Aleksey Morozov, who have established themselves as one of the most dominant lines in recent history. Combined with veterans such as Vitaly Proshkin and Vladimir Vorobiev, and imports, such as Ray Giroux, Petr Čajánek, and Jukka Hentunen, Kazan has remained one of the top teams in the league. However, they have been at times criticized for lacking consistency and relying too heavily on star players such as Morozov.\nAk Bars Kazan are strong rivals with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl and the neighboring team of Salavat Yulaev Ufa. However, Ak Bars was the strongest rival with Dynamo Moscow in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\n\n=== Champions ===\n Russian Championship (5): 1997–98, 2005–06, 2008-09, 2009–10, 2017–18\n Gagarin Cup (3): 2008-09, 2009–10, 2017–18\n Opening Cup (3): 2009–10, 2020–21, 2023–24\n Russian Superleague (2): 1997–98, 2005–06\n IIHF European Champions Cup (1): 2007\n IIHF Continental Cup (1): 2007–08\n Soviet Class A2 (3): 1962, 1985, 1989 (West)\n Soviet Class B (1): 1976\n\n\n=== Runners-up ===\n Russian Championship (5): 1999-00, 2001-02, 2006-07, 2014-15, 2019-20\n Gagarin Cup (2): 2014-15, 2022-23\n Russian Superleague (3): 1999-00, 2001-02, 2006-07\n Russian Championship (1): 2016-17\n Gagarin Cup (1): 2016-17\n Russian Superleague (1): 2003-04\n IIHF Continental Cup (1): 1999-00\n\n\n== Season-by-season KHL record ==\nNote: GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; OTL = Overtime/shootout losses; Pts = Points; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; P = Playoff \n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current roster ===\n\nUpdated 19 August 2025.\n\n\n=== Franchise KHL scoring leaders ===\n\nThese are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history.

    "content": "Maya Le Tissier (/meɪjə lə tɪziər/, French: [maja lə tisje]; born 18 April 2002) is a professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Women's Super League (WSL) club Manchester United, which she captains, and the England national team.\nLe Tissier was named to the PFA WSL Team of the Year in 2023 and earned Young Player of the Year honors at the 2024 Women's Football Awards. She was named Manchester United Women's Players' Player of the Year for 2023–24 and Brighton & Hove Albion's Women's Young Player of the Season for 2020–21. She is regarded as one of the best centre-backs in the WSL.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== St. Martins A.C. ===\nLe Tissier grew up on the channel island of Guernsey. She first played football at the age of four for local boys' club St. Martins A.C., coached by her father, Darren. With no girls' teams on the island, Le Tissier would fly to Hampshire to play for the county team twice a month from the age of 13, doing so for two years until the time commitment meant she was missing too much school and too many training sessions. She continued to play for St. Martins until the age of 16.\n\n\n=== Brighton & Hove Albion ===\nOn 1 July 2018, Le Tissier joined the academy at Women's Super League club Brighton & Hove Albion.

She made her club debut on 17 September 2022, starting and scoring two goals in a 4–0 opening day WSL win against Reading. She signed a four-year contract extension with the club on 19 April 2024.\nFollowing the departure of Katie Zelem, Le Tissier was named as club captain of Manchester United on 27 August 2024. On 19 October 2024, Le Tissier became the youngest player to reach 100 WSL appearances. She made her 100th appearance for the club on 14 September 2025 during a 5–1 WSL victory against London City Lionesses. She made her 70th consecutive WSL start for Manchester United on 28 September 2025, during a 2-0 away win versus  Liverpool and equalled the record for most consecutive WSL starts for a single club set by Aileen Whelan for  Brighton & Hove Albion. On 3 October 2025, she became the first player to make 71 consecutive starts for a single club in the home match against  Chelsea. She became United's first ever goalscorer in the Champions League as she scored the winning goal from the penalty spot in a 1–0 win at home against Valerenga on 8 October 2025. \n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Guernsey ===\nLe Tissier made history when she became the first female player to play for the Guernsey under-16 boys' team, featuring in the under-16 version of the 2018 Muratti Vase against Jersey under-16s in March of that year.\n\n\n=== England ===\n\n\n==== Youth ====\nHaving been invited to an England under-15 south west regional camp, Le Tissier went on to captain the England under-15 women's national team in a single match against the Denmark Under-15s in February 2018. In September 2018, Le Tissier was named captain of the under-17s ahead of 2019 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship qualification. England won all six qualification games without conceding and Le Tissier was named to the final squad for the 2019 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in Bulgaria. She started all three games as England were eliminated at the group stage on head-to-head goal difference having tied on six points with Germany and Netherlands.\nHer step up to under-19 level came on 6 March 2020 against Sweden in the La Manga tournament. She made her under-23 debut at the age of 19 in a friendly against Belgium on 25 October 2021.\n\n\n==== Senior ====\nIn November 2022, Le Tissier received her first senior England call-up for friendlies against Japan and Norway. She made her debut on 15 November, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw with the latter opponent. On 18 November 2022, her England legacy number was announced as number 226.

    "content": "The Mariposa botnet, discovered December 2008, is a botnet mainly involved in cyberscamming and denial-of-service attacks. Before the botnet itself was dismantled on 23 December 2009, it consisted of up to 12 million unique IP addresses or up to 1 million individual zombie computers infected with the \"Butterfly (mariposa in Spanish) Bot\", making it one of the largest known botnets.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins and initial spread ===\nThe botnet was originally created by the DDP Team (Spanish: Días de Pesadilla Team, English: Nightmare Days Team), using a malware program called \"Butterfly bot\", which was also sold to various individuals and organisations. The goal of this malware program was to install itself on an uninfected PC, monitoring activity for passwords, bank credentials and credit cards. After that the malware would attempt to self-propagate to other connectible systems using various supported methods, such as MSN, P2P and USB.\nAfter completing its initial infection routine the malware would contact a command-and-control server within the botnet. This command and control server could be used by the controllers of the botnet, in order to issue orders to the botnet itself.\n\n\n=== Operations and impact ===\nThe operations executed by the botnet were diverse, in part because parts of the botnet could be rented by third party individuals and organizations. Confirmed activities include denial-of-service attacks, e-mail spam, theft of personal information, and changing the search results a browser would display in order to show advertisements and pop-up ads.\nDue to the size and nature of a botnet its total financial and social impact is difficult to calculate, but initial estimates calculated that the removal of the malware alone could cost \"tens of millions of dollars\". After the apprehension of the botnet's operators government officials also discovered a list containing personal details on 800,000 individuals, which could be used or sold for Identity theft purposes.\nThe countries most infected by the botnet were India, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea.\n\n\n=== Dismantling ===\nIn May 2009 the Mariposa Working Group (MWG) was formed as an informal group, composed of Defence Intelligence, the Georgia Tech Information Security Center and Panda Security, along with additional unnamed security researchers and law enforcement agencies. The goal of this group was the analysis and extermination of the Mariposa botnet itself.\nOn 23 December 2009 the Mariposa Working Group managed to take control of the Mariposa Botnet, after seizing control of the command-and-control servers used by the botnet. The operational owners of the botnet eventually succeeded in regaining control over the botnet, and in response launched a denial-of-service attack on Defence Intelligence. The attack itself managed to knock out Internet connectivity for a large share of the ISP's customers, which included several Canadian universities and government agencies.\nOn 3 February 2010, the Spanish national police arrested Florencio Carro Ruiz (alias: Netkairo) as the suspected leader of the DDP Team. Two additional arrests were made on 24 February 2010. Jonathan Pazos Rivera (alias: Jonyloleante) and Juan José Ríos Bellido (alias: Ostiator) were arrested on the suspicion of being members of DDP.\nOn 18 July 2010, Matjaž Škorjanc (alias: Iserdo), the creator of the \"Butterfly bot\" malware, was arrested in Maribor by Slovenian police for the first time, but released due to lack of evidence. He was arrested again in October 2011. In December 2013 Škorjanc was convicted in Slovenia of \"creating a malicious computer program for hacking information systems, assisting in wrongdoings and money laundering.\" He was sentenced to 4 years and 10 months imprisonment and fined €3,000 ($3,000). The court also ordered the seizure of Škorjanc's property acquired with the proceeds of crime. After he appealed the verdict his fine was in February 2015 raised for additional 25,000 EUR. \nOn 5 June, 2019, US law enforcement opened a new case in the operations of the Mariposa (Butterfly Bot, BFBOT) malware gang. FBI has moved forward with new charges and arrest warrants against four suspects including NiceHash's operator Matjaž Škorjanc.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnalysis of the Mariposa botnet",

    "content": "The 11th Attack Squadron is a United States Air Force unit assigned to the 432d Wing Air Combat Command at Creech Air Force Base near Indian Springs, Nevada. It flies General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned aerial vehicles. In 1995 the 11th became the first Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) squadron in the Air Force.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe 11th Attack Squadron was the U.S. Air Force's first MQ-1B Predator formal training unit that conducts 5 basic and advanced training courses: Initial Qualification, Instructor Upgrade Training, Foreign Officer Course, Senior Officer Course, and Launch & Recovery Course. The 11th conducts intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operating MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe squadron was first activated as the 11th Observation Squadron at Wheeler-Sack Field in early 1942. It initially operated in the southeastern United States under Third Air Force flying antisubmarine patrols along the Gulf Coast after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nThe unit was reassigned to Fourth Air Force in Southern California during early 1942, flying reconnaissance, mapping, artillery adjustment, bombing, dive-bombing, and strafing missions to support Army ground units in training at the Desert Training Center or on maneuvers. It trained personnel in aerial reconnaissance, medium bombardment, and fighter techniques.\nWith the closure of the Desert Training Center in late 1943, the unit returned to Third Air Force becoming a reconnaissance training unit for Army forces at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Fort Polk, Louisiana, Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After the war it was assigned to Shaw Field, South Carolina, and was never fully equipped or manned. The unit inactivated March 1946.\n\n\n=== Cold War ===\nThe 11th was reactivated at Langley Field, Virginia in 1947. It was equipped with Lockheed RF-80 Shooting Stars as a photo-reconnaissance squadron. It was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force and moved to March Air Force Base, California. Budget constraints, though, resulted in the unit's inactivation in March 1949.\nIt was reactivated during the Korean War and equipped with Douglas RB-26 Invaders and deployed to Kimpo AFB (K-14), South Korea. Their RB-26C Invader aircraft were painted all black and flew a number of standardized intelligence-gathering missions. There were four standard missions—one that ran along the border with North Korea, another that flew up the North Korean coast on the east side, and another on the west side, and the final missions, called E (in phonetic parlance of the day, \"Easy\") was a long duration mission that headed down the coast of China to the Shantung Peninsula, gathering signals and electronics data from what was then called \"Red China\". In the mid-1950s, the unit's RB-26C Invader aircraft were transferred to the French, who used them both in France and later in Indo-China.\nThe squadron operated as part of Far East Air Forces after the Korean War, engaging in photographic and weather reconnaissance missions over South Korea as well as the Japanese Home Islands and the adjacent waters along the Korean peninsula and Chinese/Soviet Pacific coasts until 1960.\nIn 1957 the 11th Squadron received twelve Douglas RB-66C Destroyer electronic intelligence gathering planes.\n\n\n=== Vietnam war ===\nIt was activated as a McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance squadron in 1966 under Tactical Air Command. The squadron deployed to Thailand shortly after formation, flying tactical reconnaissance missions primarily over North Vietnam and selected locations in Laos and Cambodia. The squadron provided much of the aerial photographic intelligence obtained during the Vietnam War, especially that from North Vietnam. In the fall of 1970 the squadron's parent wing was phased down as part of the overall American withdrawal from the Vietnam War, returned to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina where the unit was inactivated in early 1971.\nThe unit was reactivated at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base later in 1971 as a Ryan AQM-34 Firebee unmanned tactical reconnaissance drone squadron. Performed photographic reconnaissance to support tactical air and surface forces with tactical drones manufactured by Ryan Aeronautical. It used AQM-34L/M/V drones, Lockheed DC-130 Hercules launch vehicles, and Sikorsky CH-3 recovery helicopters. The group conducted follow-on testing and evaluation of the AQM-34V model drone and the initial operational testing and evaluation and developmental testing and evaluation of the DC-130H \"mother ship.\" The unit was inactivated in 1979.\n\n\n=== The 1990s and twenty-first century ===\nAs the 11th Air Intelligence Squadron, the squadron provided real-time intelligence support to the 11th Tactical Control Wing and Eleventh Air Force at Elmendorf AFB from 1992 to 1994. Reactivated on 29 July 1995, at Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field, Nevada, under command of the 57th Operations Group, 57th Wing. In 1996 it became ",

    "title": "Rockit (instrumental)",
    "content": "\"Rockit\" is a composition recorded by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and produced by Bill Laswell and Michael Beinhorn. Hancock released it as a single from his twenty-ninth album, Future Shock (1983). The selection was composed by Hancock, Laswell, and Beinhorn.\nThe track was driven by its deejay scratch style, performed primarily by DXT, and its music video created by Godley & Creme, featuring the robotic art of Jim Whiting, which was put in high rotation on MTV. \"Rockit\" won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance in 1983, and it won five MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. In 2022 and 2025, Rolling Stone and Billboard magazine included the song in their lists of the best dance songs of all time.\n\n\n== Recording ==\n\"Rockit\" was constructed and composed during the recording process, first at BC Studio in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with additional overdubs at RPM Studios in Manhattan, then Hancock's home studio in West Hollywood, and finally at Eldorado studio in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The production duo of Material (bassist Bill Laswell and synth player Michael Beinhorn) were based at Martin Bisi's BC Studio, recording experimental, no wave and underground club music. Hancock's 25-year-old manager, Tony Meilandt, approached Laswell to write a new track for Hancock, whose career needed a boost. To gauge this potential new direction for his career, Hancock accompanied Laswell to hear a set of popular club DJs including Afrika Bambaataa and D.ST spin at Roxy NYC in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Warily eyeing the crowd, which to him looked like a riot, Hancock needed more convincing by Meilandt before he contracted with Laswell's team to deliver two tracks. Meilandt later said \"Herbie was very much ready\" to try a new kind of sound.\nAt BC Studios, Beinhorn used a new Oberheim DMX drum machine to lay down a basic beat, and Laswell brought in Daniel Ponce to augment this with Afro-Cuban batá drums. Ponce played the three drums one at a time during three recording passes, to make it sound like three drummers invoking a Santería spirit. Grand Mixer D.ST came to the studio with two deejay friends from his group Infinity Rappers to scratch for the track, bringing his own vinyl which included \"Change the Beat\" by Fab Five Freddy, (which had been recorded in the same studio). D.ST found an interesting portion of the 12-inch vinyl near the end – the voice of manager Roger Trilling saying \"Ahhh! This stuff is really fresh\" through the studio's vocoder – and he scratched through that section. Trilling had been playing with the vocoder in the studio, mocking Elektra Records executive Bruce Lundvall who was in the habit of sitting back in his chair and declaring a song \"fresh\" if he liked it, without knowing that the word fresh was current in hip-hop subculture. This moment was captured on tape, and Laswell worked it into the conclusion of \"Change the Beat\".\nThe 2-inch 16-track master tape containing rhythm parts and scratching needed to be transferred to 24-track 2-inch in order for Hancock to work with it at his home studio. Laswell and Bisi took the tape to RPM Studios in Greenwich Village, but instead of simply transferring the format, they added some extra sounds, especially a stab of guitar taken from a Led Zeppelin song on the album Coda. Using the repeat hold function of a Lexicon Prime Time digital delay, they attempted to capture a Led Zeppelin snare drum sound, but a moment of inattention resulted in the guitar stab, which Laswell found better suited his purpose.\nHancock first heard the work-in-progress in West Hollywood at his home studio, a former guest house in back of his main residence. Hancock determined that the track needed a melody line. Hancock, Laswell and Beinhorn composed one on the spot by humming out loud to each other. Then Hancock recorded his ideas on three different synthesizers, performing on them one at a time. When Hancock suggested performing some vocoder vocal scat, Laswell and Beinhorn said they could instead sample lyrics from a hit song, specifically the line \"Rock it, don't stop it\" from \"Planet Rock\", which was at that time a hit for Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force. This lyric sample produced the title \"Rockit\".\nA final recording session was convened at Eldorado Studios located at Hollywood and Vine, Hollywood, Los Angeles. To round out the turntablist sounds, D.ST flew out from New York along with his colleague Grandmaster Caz. Session engineer Dave Jerden remarked to Beinhorn that Hancock appeared hopeful about the track, but that he did not realize what he had. After the brief 90-minute session, the New York contingent went to a local stereo shop to pass the time before their flight home. Carrying a cassette tape of the final mix, they listened to \"Rockit\" on some loudspeakers at the shop, attracting the attention of children from the neighborhood who were amazed and curious. Judging their reaction, Laswell told D.ST, \"That's a hit record.\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nHe",

After having a conversation with David Hill, Vice President of Lenovo Brand Management on November 12th, 2008 Sapper agreed to create a design for the device despite the short turn around needed.

This is the last album to feature Kelly Green (Tom Beaudry) and Gary Ray Thompson; their departure from the group soon followed, fueled by an ego-driven notion that 'they' were Frijid Pink. The band were on the brink of major success at that time, but this breach of contract essentially ruined their chances. The LP reached only #149 on U.S. charts, although the debut one reached #11; the track \"Sing A Song For Freedom\" as a single made #55 in the US in July 1970 and #22 in Canada that September where the LP reached #54.\nGerman CD release (1997, Repertoire Records) includes four bonus tracks taken from 1971 and 1972 singles.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll titles by Thompson & Beaudry except where noted.\n\n\"Black Lace\" – 6:10\n\"Sing A Song For Freedom\" (Thompson, Beaudry, Stevers) – 3:00\n\"I'll Never Be Lonely\" (Thompson, Beaudry, Harris) – 5:01\n\"Bye Bye Blues\" – 4:56\n\"Pain In My Heart\" – 8:19\n\"Sloony\" (instrumental) (Thompson, Harris, Stevers) – 3:36\n\"I'm Movin'\" – 4:53\n\"I Haven't Got The Time\" – 4:21\n\n\n=== Bonus tracks ===\n\"We're Gonna Be There\" – 2:28\n\"Shorty Kline\" – 2:19\n\"I Love Her\" – 2:20\n\"Lost Son\" – 2:45\nTracks 1–8 produced by Pink Unlimited, bonus tracks by Pink and Vinnie Testa\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Frijid Pink ===\nKelly Green – vocals, cowbell\nGary Ray Thompson – lead & rhythm guitars\nTom Harris – bass\nRichard Stevers – drums, tympani\n\n\n=== Additional Musicians ===\nLarry Zelanka – keyboards\n\n\n=== Personnel Notes ===\nTom Beaudry aka Kelly Green did not play bass guitar on this album, only contributed the vocals.

    "title": "Domain-general learning",
    "content": "Domain-general learning theories of development suggest that humans are born with mechanisms in the brain that exist to support and guide learning on a broad level, regardless of the type of information being learned. Domain-general learning theories also recognize that although learning different types of new information may be processed in the same way and in the same areas of the brain, different domains also function interdependently. Because these generalized domains work together, skills developed from one learned activity may translate into benefits with skills not yet learned. Another facet of domain-general learning theories is that knowledge within domains is cumulative, and builds under these domains over time to contribute to our greater knowledge structure. Psychologists whose theories align with domain-general framework include developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, who theorized that people develop a global knowledge structure which contains cohesive, whole knowledge internalized from experience, and psychologist Charles Spearman, whose work led to a theory on the existence of a single factor accounting for all general cognitive ability.\nDomain-general learning theories are in direct opposition to domain-specific learning theories, also sometimes called theories of Modularity. Domain-specific learning theories posit that humans learn different types of information differently, and have distinctions within the brain for many of these domains. Domain-specific learning theorists also assert that these neural domains are independent, purposed solely for the acquisition of one skill (i.e. facial recognition or mathematics), and may not provide direct benefits in the learning of other, unrelated skills.\n\n\n== Related Theories ==\n\n\n=== Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development ===\n\nDevelopmental psychologist, Jean Piaget, theorized that one's cognitive ability, or intelligence – defined as the ability to adapt to all aspects of reality – evolves through a series of four qualitatively distinct stages (the sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational and formal operational stages). Piaget's theory describes three core cognitive processes that serve as mechanisms for transitioning from one stage to the next.\nPiaget's core processes for developmental change:\n\nAssimilation: The process of transforming new information so that it fits with ones' existing way of thinking.\nAccommodation: The process of adapting ones' thinking to account for new experiences.\nEquilibration: The process by which one integrates their knowledge about the world into one unified whole.\nHowever, these processes are not the only processes responsible for progressing through Piaget's developmental stages. Each stage is differentiated based upon the types of conceptual content that can be mastered within it. Piaget's theory holds that transitioning from one stage of development to the next is not only a result of assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration, but also a result of developmental changes in domain-general mechanisms. As humans mature, various domain-general mechanisms become more sophisticated, and thus, according to Piaget, allow for growth in cognitive functioning.\nFor example, Piaget's theory notes that the humans transition into the concrete operation stage of cognitive development when they acquire the ability to take perspective, and no longer have egocentric thinking (a characteristic of the pre-operational stage). This change can be viewed as the result of developmental changes in information processing capacity. Information processing is a mechanism that is used across many different domains of cognitive functioning, and thus can be seen as a domain-general mechanism.\n\n\n=== Psychometric Theories of Intelligence ===\nPsychometric analysis of measurements of human cognitive abilities (intelligence) may suggest that there is a single underlying mechanism that impacts how humans learn. In the early 20th century, Charles Spearman noticed that children's scores on different measures of cognitive abilities were positively correlated. Spearman believed that these correlations could be attributed to a general mental ability or process that is utilized across all cognitive tasks. Spearman labeled this general mental ability as the g factor, and believed g could represent an individual's overall cognitive functioning. The presence of this g factor across different cognitive measures is well-established and uncontroversial in statistical research. It may be that this g factor highlights domain-general learning (cognitive mechanisms involved in all cognition), and that this general learning accounts for the positive correlations across seemingly different cognitive tasks. It is important to note, however, there currently is no consensus to what causes the positive correlations.\n\nSpearman's work was expanded upon by Raymond B. Cattell, who broke g into two broad abilities: fluid intelligence (Gf) and crystallized intelli",

    "title": "Ewerdt Hilgemann",
    "content": "Ewerdt Hilgemann (Born in Witten, February 21, 1938) is a German artist, currently living and working in the Netherlands.\n\n\n== Studies and career ==\nEwerdt Hilgemann was born in Witten, Germany and after a brief study at Westfälische Wilhelms-University in Münster, he attended Werkkunstschule and University of Saarland in Saarbrücken. In the 1960s he had residencies at Kätelhöhn Printers in Wamel, Asterstein in Koblenz and Halfmannshof in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Hilgemann started to exhibit his work across Europe in the early 1960s before moving to Gorinchem, the Netherlands in 1970. From 1977 to 1998 he taught Concept Development at the Sculpture Department of Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. Since 1984 Hilgemann lives and works in Amsterdam. His main workshop, however, remained in Hardinxveld-Giessendam, near Gorinchem.\n\n\n== Work ==\nHilgemann's bodies of work from the 1960s focused on wall pieces, consisting of wooden dowels, as well as serial and minimalistic installations (\"Space Structures\") out of large resin or steel tubes. In the 1970s, reliefs and mostly wooden abstract geometrical sculptures followed, based on grids as well as the cube. The 1980s meant a change in thinking, when Hilgemann made his first photographic work Random Sculptures (for herman de vries), followed by a series of granite boulders e.g. referencing to the (maximum) cube that can fit inside a sphere by cutting away what was needed to reveal the cube, yet showing all parts of the process. In 1982, for the first time with an audience, he rolled a perfectly polished marble cube (150x150x150 cm) down hill in the famous Carrara quarry, where Michelangelo already got his marble from. The result was a scratched and battered piece, but it still remained recognisable as a cube! \"Rolling Cube 1982 (shortened video)\".\nLikewise, in 1983 he brought two perfectly polished spheres to a controlled explosion, resulting in fractured pieces carefully accounted for (3 parts for the white Carrara marble, 9 parts for the dark Bardiglio marble). The same year, during sculpture symposium East-West Forum in Dordrecht, Netherlands he made his first welded steel cube, which he threw down from the rooftop of an abandoned factory.\nThese sculptures and their planned destruction depend to a large extent on random circumstances. However, these can also be premeditated by stipulating their conditions. According to the artist, this equally is the case with his so-called \"Implosion Sculptures\", which Hilgemann started in 1984 and that are still going on. The perfectly welded stainless steel geometrical shapes are vacuumed by a pump (or by means of water), causing the body to slowly give way to the outside pressure, resulting in a new form, yet leaving a visual reference to the original. The most used shapes are cubes, square columns and pyramids.\nIn 2014 Hilgemann was invited by the Park Avenue Sculpture Committee to exhibit his work on the median along Park Avenue in New York City for a period of three months, starting in August. For this prestigious environment Hilgemann designed new works for seven locations between 52nd and 67th Street, all made of stainless steel in different configurations, single pieces as well as groups of two or more.\n\n\n=== Works in public spaces (selection) ===\n2021 Threesome, EUREF Campus, Berlin, Germany \n2020 Three of a kind, Smalley Sculpture Garden, California\n2017 Imploded pyramid, Grugapark, Essen, Germany \n2011 Three Graces, Bad Soden, Germany\n2010 Imploded Column, New Pacific, Beverly Hills, California\n2006 Quint, Hervormd Lyceum, Amsterdam, Netherlands \n2005 Double-Up, Aegon Collection, The Hague, Netherlands\n2004 Panta Rhei, City of Hünfeld, Germany\n2000 Cerberus, Investment Bank Berlin, Germany\n1996 Imploded Cube, Il-San Sculpture Park, Ko-Yang City, Korea\n1995 Imploded Column, City of Sárospatak, Hungary\n1992 Fountain, City of Ingolstadt, Germany\n1992 Delft Implosion, Technical University Delft, Netherlands\n1991 Plus Minus, City of Gorinchem, Netherlands (co-production Jan van Munster)\n1991 Homage to Brancusi, City of Galati, Romania\n1990 Reflection, City of Nivala, Finland\n1989 Tension, City of Rotterdam\n1987 Birth, City of Heemstede, Netherlands\n1986 Rolling Cube, City of Sion, Switzerland\n1986 Natura Artis Magistra, University Nymegen, Netherlands\n1986 Imploded Column (Elblag Implosion), Elblag, Poland\n1986 Imploded Pyramid, City of Kleinsassen, Germany\n1985 Imaginary Landscape, IWO, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n1985 Exploded Sphere, Sculpture Park, Dordrecht, Netherlands\n1983 Finnish Landscape, City of Kemi, Finland\n1979 Field of 32 Cubes, City of Brielle, Netherlands\n1978 1+2=3, City of Gorinchem, Netherlands\n1974 Three equal volumes, City of Gorinchem, Netherlands\n1972 Cube Structure, City of Gorinchem, Netherlands\n1969 Space Structure (Bijlmer), City of Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\n\n=== Works in public art collections (selection) ===\nDenmark\n\nLouisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk\nGermany\n\nKunsthalle Bremen, Bremen\nFor",

    "title": "Nate Bargatze",
    "content": "Nathanael Bargatze ( bar-GET-see; born March 25, 1979) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He has been called a clean comedian, and has been noted for his deadpan, monotone delivery. Bargatze was the highest-grossing stand-up comic in 2024, with over a million tickets sold across his shows.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBargatze was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Carol and Stephen Bargatze, on March 25, 1979. Stephen was a clown, member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and motivational speaker, while Carol worked in the ticket office for the Vanderbilt Commodores. After a troubled childhood, Stephen had initially studied to become a preacher, but ultimately graduated from Trevecca Nazarene College with a bachelor's degree in education, 10 years after leaving high school.\nRaised in a devoutly religious Christian household, Bargatze is one of three children. His father practiced magic tricks with him while growing up, and Bargatze stated he performed in skits with his church group, beginning when he \"was around 11\". He attended DuPont Elementary in Old Hickory, Tennessee until fourth grade, when he transferred to Donelson Christian Academy (DCA) in Nashville, where his father had a day job as a history teacher. He competed in track and field at DCA and tried out for the basketball and golf teams, but was cut from both. He graduated in 1997.\nBargatze then attended Volunteer State Community College in nearby Gallatin for a year. During this time, he had various jobs, such as working in construction, manning a cellphone kiosk at Walmart, and delivering furniture. He enrolled in Western Kentucky University, but flunked each of his courses and dropped out. He also had a stint working at Applebee's and later landed a job as a meter-reader for a water company in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. He was a fan of The Bob & Tom Show, a radio program which often hosted comedians, and it inspired him to become a comedian himself. One of his fellow meter-readers, Michael Clay, also had an ambition to become a comedian, and together they decided to quit their jobs and both pursue a comedy career. Bargatze's parents were supportive of his decision and attended his first open mic event.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nBargatze began his comedy career in 2002, and moved to Chicago to attend The Second City, an improvisational comedy troupe. He soon decided against improv and instead enrolled in Jim Rauth's Comedy College, which focused on stand-up comedy. At this time, Bargatze rented a basement apartment with his former co-worker Michael Clay and worked as a waiter at a nearby bar. He performed fill-in spots at Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago, and also performed at Zanies Nashville.\nIn 2004, Bargatze moved to New York City, where he became a barker for the renowned Boston Comedy Club, handing out flyers in Greenwich Village in exchange for stage time at night in the club. Bargatze also worked as a dogwalker and a FedEx delivery driver during the day to support his comedy career. He has called the Jerry Seinfeld documentary Comedian (2002) \"life-changing\" and a \"big reason\" why he moved to New York. While at the Boston Comedy Club, he saw comedians such as Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Patrice O'Neal, and Bill Burr perform live. Bargatze stated that it took \"about a year\" before he received a paying gig in New York. He spent most of his early years performing for single-digit crowds.\nBargatze had a turning-point year in 2008, featuring on Comedy Central's stand-up show Live at Gotham, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. He toured extensively with the USO, performing for American troops stationed in countries such as the Bahamas, Greenland, Honduras, Iraq, and Kuwait. He co-hosted a podcast, It Could Be Better, with Chris Laker and Yannis Pappas from 2009 to 2013. He won both New York's Comedy Festival and the Boston Comedy Festival in 2010, and released his first 30-minute special in 2011, as part of an episode of Comedy Central Presents.\nBargatze decided to move to Los Angeles in 2012, taking inspiration from Jerry Weintraub's quote \"as soon as you feel comfortable that's when it's time to start over\". He released his first comedy album, Yelled At By A Clown, in 2012 on Aspecialthing Records. It was on the Billboard Top Ten Comedy Charts for two weeks, peaking at No. 2. Bargatze received effusive praise from Marc Maron, and appeared on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast in 2012. He was booked on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in 2013. He also was part of Jimmy Fallon's Clean Cut Comedy Tour that year. Speaking of his participation in the tour and his choice to be a clean comedian, Bargatze said: \"I grew up watching clean comedy. Starting out, I wanted my parents to come watch me. I still think that way, even though I'm a parent now. I'm a clean comic, but I don't really want people to notice it. ... A good compliment for me would be, 'I didn't even notice that you were clean.' ",

    "content": "Suomen Kuvalehti (lit. 'Finland's picture magazine' or 'the Finnish picture magazine') is a weekly Finnish language family and news magazine published in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nSuomen Kuvalehti was founded in 1873 and published until the year 1880. The magazine started publishing again in 1917, and continues to this day. It was merged with Kansan Kuvalehti in 1934. The editor in 1935 was L.M. Viherjuuri. Ilmari Turja edited the magazine from 1936 to 1951.\nThe headquarters of Suomen Kuvalehti is in Helsinki. Otava (publisher) publishes the magazine, every Friday. One of its former editor is Ville Pernaa.\nSuomen Kuvalehti originally supported center-right politics in the country.  In the aftermath of the Finnish Civil War, from which Finland emerged as an independent, democratic republic, the magazine valorized the victorious Whites as patriots and heroes. It also published Vapautemme hinta, a book detailing Finnish losses during the Winter War and like the vast majority of the Finnish press strongly favored the Finnish government against the Soviet invasion of Finland. During the Cold War period it was one of the Finnish publications which were accused by the Soviet Union of being the instrument of US propaganda, and the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki frequently protested the editors of the magazine.\nIn more modern times, the magazine has had a conservative and Finnish liberal stance without direct political affiliation. The weekly aims to write in-depth articles about current topics and to provide opinion-shaping editorials. The magazine focuses on news about national and international politics and culture. It is one of the investigative journalism outlets in the country. Diary excerpts of Finnish novelist Antti Tuuri about his visit to Germany between 1992 and 1995 were published in Suomen Kuvalehti. The comic strip Blondie regularly appears in the magazine. In the Jyviä ja akanoita (\"wheat and chaff\") column, various humorous misprints and grammatical goofs from other magazines and newspapers are printed.\nIn March 1997 two journalists from Suomen Kuvalehti were arrested in Diyarbakır, Turkey, while reporting about the Kurdish movement in the region.\n\n\n== Circulation ==\nThe circulation of Suomen Kuvalehti was 102,000 copies in 2007 and 96,000 copies in 2009. In 2010 its circulation fell to 88,667 copies. The 2011 circulation of the weekly grew to 91,277 copies.

Phil tells the Lupertazzi crime family that he is ready to settle down and \"enjoy [his] grandchildren.\"\nA flashback of two years prior  shows Tony Soprano fleeing into the woods when Johnny Sack is arrested by the FBI. A teenage boy sees Tony throw a pistol into the snow and retrieves it. In the present, the boy is arrested on a drug charge and the gun is found in his possession, armed with hollow-point bullets. Essex County police ostentatiously arrest Tony on a gun charge based on the boy's testimony. He is briefly jailed but his attorney, Neil Mink, easily secures his release on bail. The gun charge is soon dropped, and no longer hangs over Tony's approaching birthday weekend. The FBI later includes this charge in a RICO case being built against Tony.\nTony and Carmela travel to Janice and Bobby's cabin in upstate New York to celebrate Tony's birthday. Tony and Bobby bond as they fire a customized AR-10 assault rifle, Bobby's birthday present to Tony, in the nearby woods. Tony tasks Bobby with a new set of responsibilities in the Soprano family, and hints at a still higher position in the near future. Bobby muses how suddenly and silently death can happen in their lives as gangsters: ”You probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?” Tony comments that Bobby has never \"popped his cherry\" (killed anyone) in contrast with Bobby's father, who according to Tony, was a notorious hit man in his time. Bobby replies that he has come close, but that his father never wanted it for him.\nCarmela phones A.J.; he answers the phone, not at the pizzeria where he is now working, but in his parents' bed with Blanca. A group of friends also come for a party.\nAfter dinner, Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice play Monopoly, arguing about house rules, drinking, and joking. Tony is angry with Janice when she tells a story that discredits their father. He makes a crude joke about her in return, insincerely apologizes, but then makes another, provoking Bobby to punch him in the face. There is a messy and ferocious fight. Tony ends up on the floor, bloodied, unable to rise. Panicking, Bobby tries to drive off drunk and backs into a tree; he returns and apologizes. Janice is enraged with Bobby, fearing retaliation from Tony. In the morning, Tony and Carmela are persuaded to stay, but Tony fixates on his loss in the fight.\nIn the afternoon, the women apprehensively watch Tony and Bobby leave, ostensibly for a game of golf. In reality, the two men are meeting with a pair of Québécois. In exchange for a large amount of expired prescription medication at a heavy discount, Tony agrees to a hit on the brother-in-law of one of the Québécois and asks Bobby to personally take care of it. Bobby has to accept. They return to the cabin and Carmela and Tony leave for home. Bobby immediately sets off for Montreal for the hit; he kills the man at point-blank range, drops the gun and walks off. He returns to the cabin, picks up his daughter, and hugs her. Back home, Tony watches a \"Soprano Home Movies\" DVD given to him by Janice as a birthday present: it shows himself and Janice as children, playing together.\n\n\n== First appearance ==\nFaustino \"Doc\" Santoro: a veteran made man, very likely a capo, of the Lupertazzi crime family, one of the mobsters who welcomes Phil Leotardo back from the hospital.\n\n\n== Deceased ==\nRené LeCours: executed by Bobby Baccalieri in Montreal on orders from Tony Soprano in exchange for $35,000 off the drug prices negotiated with French Canadian gangsters.\n\n\n== Title reference ==\nJanice's birthday pres",

    "content": "Dickin is a surname of English and Irish origin originating in the mid-11th century during the Norman conquests.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the Dickin surname stems from the Norman conquests of 1066 and King Richard the First of England. Patronymic naming, established following the Norman conquests, meant that Richard's son would become Richardson (Richard + Son). Eventually, as the shorthand for Richard became \"Dick\" the name morphed into Dickson and several other related names. In order to be gender neutral, the name also morphed into being the kin of Richard, as in Richard's kin or Dick + Kin, which was eventually shortened to Dickin.\n\n\n== Geographic settlement ==\n\n\n=== Great Britain ===\nThe 1891 England and Wales census shows a high concentration of Dickin families in Lancashire (19%), Shropshire (23%), and Staffordshire (15%). A large number of records between 1532 and 1812 show the prominent use of the Dickin surname at that time.\n\n\n=== North America ===\nThe earliest known records of the Dickin family in North America show John Dickin landing in New England in 1753 and Alexander Dickin landing in Maryland in 1813.\n\n\n== Alternate spellings ==\nWhile the root of the surname is always Richard, the Dickin surname has seen its spelling changed.

    "title": "Sonobe",
    "content": "The Sonobe module is one of the many units used to build modular origami. The popularity of Sonobe modular origami models derives from the simplicity of folding the modules, the sturdy and easy assembly, and the flexibility of the system.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the Sonobe module is unknown. Two possible creators are Toshie Takahama (Japanese: 高浜利恵) and Mitsunobu Sonobe (Japanese: 薗部光伸), who published several books together and were both members of Sōsaku Origami Gurūpu '67 (Japanese: 創作折り紙グループ'67). The earliest appearance of a Sonobe module was in a cube attributed to Mitsunobu Sonobe in the Sōsaku Origami Gurūpu '67's magazine Origami in Issue 2 (1968). It does not reveal whether he invented the module or used an earlier design; the phrase \"finished model by Mitsunobu Sonobe\" is ambiguous. The diagram from Issue 2 reappears in 1970 in the group's book New Introduction to Origami (Japanese: 新しい折り紙入門, Hepburn: Atarashii origami nyūmon). Another 1970s appearance of the unit was in the model \"Toshie's Jewel\", from Toshie Takahama's book Creative Life With Creative Origami Vol 1 (Japanese: 暮しをかざるおりがみ). In the mid-1970s, Steve Krimball created the 30-unit ball, as mentioned in The Origamian vol. 13, no. 3 June 1976. Since then, many variations of modified Sonobe units have been developed; some examples of these can be found in Meenakshi Mukerji's book Marvelous Modular Origami (2007). Another variation to Sonobe models is the addition of secondary units to basic Sonobe unit forms to create new geometric shapes; some of which can be seen in Tomoko Fuse's book Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations (1990).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEach individual unit is folded from a square sheet of paper, of which only one face is visible in the finished module; many ornamented variants of the plain Sonobe unit that expose both sides of the paper have been designed.\nThe Sonobe unit has the shape of a parallelogram with 45º and 135º angles, divided by creases into two diagonal tabs at the ends and two corresponding pockets within the inscribed center square. The system can build a wide range of three-dimensional geometric forms by docking these tabs into the pockets of adjacent units. Three interconnected Sonobe units will form an open-bottomed triangular pyramid with an equilateral triangle for the open bottom, and isosceles right triangles as the other three faces. It will have a right-angle apex (equivalent to the corner of a cube) and three tab/pocket flaps protruding from the base. This particularly suits polyhedra that have equilateral triangular faces: Sonobe modules can replace each notional edge of the original deltahedron by the central diagonal fold of one unit and each equilateral triangle with a right-angle pyramid consisting of one half each of three units, without dangling flaps. The pyramids can be made to point inwards; assembly is more difficult but some cases of encroaching can be obviously prevented.\nThe simplest shape made of these pyramids, often called \"Toshie's Jewel\" (shown above), is named after origami artist Toshie Takahama, who first printed a diagram of this in her 1974 book Creative Life with Creative Origami. It is a three-unit hexahedron built around the notional scaffold of a flat equilateral triangle (two \"faces\", three edges); the protruding tab/pocket flaps are simply reconnected on the underside, resulting in two triangular pyramids joined at the base, a triangular bipyramid.\nA popular intermediate model is the triakis icosahedron, shown below.  It requires 30 units to build.\n\n\n== Usage ==\n \n\nThe table below shows the correlation between three basic characteristics – faces, edges, and vertices – of polygons (composed of Toshie's Jewel sub-units) of varying size and the number of Sonobe units used:\n\nThe model made of three units results in a triangular bipyramid. Building a pyramid on each face of a regular tetrahedron, using six units, results in a cube (the central fold of each module lays flat, creating square faces instead of isosceles right triangular faces, and changing the formula for the number of faces, edges, and vertices), or triakis tetrahedron. Building a pyramid on each face of a regular octahedron, using twelve Sonobe units, results in a triakis octahedron. Building a pyramid on each face of a regular icosahedron requires 30 units, and results in a triakis icosahedron.\nUniform polyhedra can be adapted to Sonobe modules by replacing non-triangular faces with pyramids having equilateral faces; for example by adding pentagonal pyramids pointing inwards to the faces of a dodecahedron a 90-module ball can be obtained.\nThe 270-module ball looks like a very complicated shape, but it is just an icosahedron with each triangular face divided into 9 small triangles. Each small triangle is made of 3 sonobe units.\nArbitrary shapes, beyond symmetrical polyhedra, can also be constructed; a deltahedron with 2N faces and 3N edges requires 3N Sonobe modules.\nA popular class of arbitrar",

    "content": "Michelle Jaffé is an American intermedia artist, known for her immersive participatory installations combining sculpture, sound, and performative video. Symbols, forms, and concepts in her work are often influenced by political, spiritual, and psychological themes. Prior to her career as an artist, Jaffé was notable in the New York City fashion scene for her hat and accessory designs.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJaffé lived and was educated in Europe from ages fourteen to twenty-three. Her paternal grandparents lived in Shanghai and childhood exposure to both traditional Chinese and Japanese art had a significant influence on her visual sensibility and artistic development.\nIn 1979, Jaffé earned a BA Honors in Fine Arts and French literature at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England. She studied stone carving at the Sculpture Center School in 1991, sculpture at the New York Studio School in 1992, and sound at Harvestworks Digital Media in 2002, and Jewelry Design at Fashion Institute of Technology in New York in 1995.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nJaffé's mature body of work combines sculpture, sound and vocal compositions, and video within installations that prompt active listening. Her formative sculptures made from steel, aluminum, and other malleable materials, resemble shapes and forms that evoke armor, such as breastplates, chastity belts, and medieval codpieces. Her “Vestment Series” (2000-2007) of metal sculptures envision clothing as a form of both physical and psychological shelter. Regarding two particular sculptures from the series, Breastplate (2002) and Preying Mantis (2002), Olivia Kohler-Maga, Assistant Director of the Luther W. Brady Art Gallery at George Washington University, observed that, “In Breastplate, she takes a piece of armor—something that is meant to protect you—and it becomes almost delicate and airy, floating off the wall. In case you think the work isn't fit for battle, the back edges are fitted with menacing, serrated edges. The piece next to it, Preying Mantis, takes the forms a step further, likening it to an insect known for its attack.” \nAround the year 2000, Jaffé started exploring sound alongside her sculptural works. Some of her notable audiovisual works include Wappen Field, exhibited at Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2011; Bosi Contemporary gallery in New York in 2012; Beall Center for Art +Technology at UC Irvine in 2013; Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 2015; New Media Gallery in New Westminster, Canada in 2017, and Soul Junk, exhibited at Milton Art Bank in Milton, Pennsylvania in 2017; White Box in New York City in 2019; Murmur/Mutter/Yell exhibited at 11 Rivington, New York in 2021; and GRIFTER's Gambit exhibited at NYU Audio Lab at 370 Media Commons, Brooklyn in 2025.\nWappen Field (2003 - 2015) is a twenty-seven minute abstract vocal composition utilizing SuperCollider programming. The recording is played through twelve chrome plated steel helmets to create an enveloping sonic installation that moves throughout each helmet. Jaffé has stated that the installation is intended to prompt participants to contemplate “what we, as human beings, share in common instead of focusing on what divides us.” Art historian Stephanie Buhmann notes that while everyone who experiences Wappen Field is enveloped by a separate mask and a unique component of the vocal composition, it also “guarantees a sharable endeavor” because viewers must interact with each helmet to hear the complete composition. When Wappen Field was exhibited in 2011 as part of a group exhibition at the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts in Grand Rapids, Michigan, art critic Joseph Becherer noted that it was “Among the most sophisticated in terms of concept and form.” Wappen Field was also featured in the exhibition Behind the Mask at Culture Lab LIC, in Queens, New York in 2024.  \nSoul Junk (2013 - 2019) is a twenty-eight minute, three-channel video and sound installation, presenting a female stream of conscious narrative juxtaposing personal trauma with observations about abuses of power throughout society.\nMurmur / Mutter / Yell ( 2019-2021) is a sound and light installation using Wave Field Synthesis speakers to sculpt the thirty-five-minute vocal composition in a three-dimensional space. The libretto explores the implications of private data that is mined from an online user agreeing to a website or application’s conditions and terms.\nLocaleS3 (2023) is a collaborative project using sound as a kinetic plastic material for making sculpture. In 2022, Jaffé, along with Phil Edelstein and David Reeder began working series of projects that share interests in composing, the physical and dimensional properties of sound, and software. The first, titled LocaleS3 premiered during Harvestworks 2023 Art and Technology Program on Governor's Island. It consists of a series of immersive compositions arranged in site-specific locations within a house that are disc",

    "content": "Epsilon Scorpii is a binary star in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. The primary component has the proper name Larawag . It has an apparent visual magnitude of around +2.3, making it the fifth-brightest member of the constellation. Parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission provide a measured distance of 63.7 light-years (19.5 parsecs).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nLarawag has a stellar classification of K1 III, which indicates it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved into a giant star. Its mass is estimated at 1.3 times the mass of the Sun, and its radius is 12.65 times that of the Sun. Presently it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of helium at its core, which, considering the star's composition, places it along an evolutionary branch termed the horizontal branch. In the color-magnitude diagram, the star is located in the red clump. The star's outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 4,522 K, giving it the orange hue of a cool K-type star.\nIt is classified as a suspected variable star with a magnitude range of 2.23 to 2.35, although a study of Hipparcos photometry showed a variation of no more than 0.01–0.02 magnitudes. It is an X-ray source with a luminosity of (1.5–1.6)×1027 erg/s.\nIn 2018 it was found that Epsilon Scorpii A has a proper motion companion separated by 14.4\", making it a binary star sytstem. The companion, B, is much smaller and fainter than the primary, with 0.26% of the mass, 0.29% the radius, and less than 1% of the Sun's luminosity.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nε Scorpii, Latinised to Epsilon Scorpii, is the star's Bayer designation.\nThe star bore the traditional name Larawag in the culture of the Wardaman people of the Northern territory of Australia, meaning clear sighting. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Larawag for Epsilon Scorpii A on 19 November 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.\nPatrick Moore introduced the name Wei as Chinese name for this star. However, this seems to be a misreading, as Chinese 尾宿 (Wěi Xiù, English Tail) refers to an asterism (i.e. Chinese constellation) consisting of Epsilon Scorpii, Mu1 Scorpii, Zeta Scorpii, Eta Scorpii, Theta Scorpii, Iota Scorpii, Kappa Scorpii, Lambda Scorpii and Upsilon Scorpii. Consequently, the name for Epsilon Scorpii itself is 尾宿二 (Wěi Xiù èr), which means \"the Second Star of Tail\".\n\n\n== In culture ==\nEpsilon Scorpii appears on the  flag of Brazil, symbolising the state of Ceará.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It became a number-one hit in Australia the same year, and it also found success in New Zealand, where it reached number four. In the United States, it was serviced to adult album alternative radio in late January 2002.\nThe song was written by Chambers as a commentary on the reluctance of commercial radio stations towards playing her music, despite her being an established performer. However, the single prompted Chambers' commercial breakthrough and was most-added song to radio station playlists in 2002.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2017, the song was selected for the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia collection of historically and culturally important recordings.\nJunkee said, \"2009's The Loved Ones, a horror film about an obsessed stalker, put Kasey Chambers' hit in the mouth of its villain.

    "content": "Romorantin - Pruniers Air Detachment (DA 273) is a French Air Force military facility, located 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) southwest of Romorantin-Lanthenay, in the Loir-et-Cher department of central France.\nPruniers airfield was part of a huge depot built for the United States Army Air Service during World War I as an aircraft engineering facility. After the Armistice, the airfield stayed operational, with a French Air Force depot built in 1934. The airfield is slightly widened during World War II by the German Luftwaffe, but not much used.  It returned to French control in September 1944, still as a depot.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nDA 273 is primarily a logistics base for repairing aircraft by maintaining warehouses of spare parts. It is also a center for printing and issuing the technical documentation for the French Air Force. It also operates a small grass airfield as center for glider pilot training. It has a worldwide reputation as the gliding training site for the air Air Force for national and international competitions.\nThe base employs approximately 650; half of the workforce are civilian personnel.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first aviation use of Romorantin was in 1911, when a professor at the Collège Maurice Genevoix in Romorantin set up a \"Society pour le Développement de l'Aéronautique\".  On 3 June 1911, the new society organized the demonstration of a Blériot Aéronautique monoplane which was flown for eight and one-half minutes from the military training and firing range of \"La Butte\".  After the flight, the crowd went wild and the Mayor offered champagne. After a second flight, this aviation event remained deeply marked in local annals. According to the elected officials at the time, there were more than 10,000 people in attendance at the demonstration.\nOn 31 March 1912, the city council received a letter from the Ligue National Aéronautique (an aviation lobbying association whose president was Georges Clemenceau) suggesting that some land be provided for an airfield. With the help of the LNA, a \"station aéronautique\" is set on the military range of La Butte, one miles out of Romorantin, on the road leading to the futur Pruniers airfield, with one hangar at the edge of the field; the new aerodrome was inaugurated in June 1913. No civil aircraft were permanently based as the station was mostly designed to bring shelter for passing aircraft: in 1913, during military manoeuvres, some French Aeronautique Militaire's planes landed at the airfield, on a stop-over to Limoges.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nFrom 1915, the \"La Butte\" airfield was often used by the trainer aircraft from the Avord air school; it was event projected for a time to build a flying school on the airfield. With the construction of the American depot at Pruniers, the \"old\" airfield was abandoned and used to store disused aircraft.\nIn early 1917, after the entry of the United States into the war, the site of Pruniesr was chosen over eight others for use by the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Forces for the establishment of a large Air Force Depot, eventually known as the Air Service Production Center No. 2.  Romorantin was selected due to the low population density, the flatness of the terrain, the large presence of timber and also the fact that a large number or railroads between the Atlantic shipping ports converged there and also went into the Zone of the Advance (Western Front).\n\n\n==== Facilities ====\n\nOn 28 June 1917, the first American forces arrived, the 75th, 109th and 116th Aero Squadrons (Construction) which initially established quarters for themselves in the French Army Camp des Bluets about three miles away from the facility. The first construction was that of a railroad line and barracks for themselves at the field.\nWithin two weeks, the barracks were ready and construction of the actual base was begun.  The 116th Squadron was transferred out and the 75th and 109th were re-designated as the 487th Aero (Construction) and 803d Aero (Repair). Construction then began in earnest on the base facilities and also two landing field. Additional units brought in for construction were the 465th and 493d Aero Squadrons (Construction).\nA compound for the American soldiers assigned to Romorantin was established at a French barracks named North Camp Gièvres in the nearby town of Pruniers-en-Sologne. The camp eventually became the home of almost 30,000 personnel, living in barracks. However, their influence in Pruniers, along with the towns of Gièvres, Villefranche-sur-Cher and Romorantin was evident.  They made many friends with the local inhabitants and frequented the shops,  restaurants and taverns daily. Also the Americans relied on the local economy for civilian workers such as bakers, cooks, and various tradesmen.\nEventually the facility consisted of over 200 buildings on 40 hectares (99 acres) of land; a gasoline and oil depot; refrigerator plant; weapons storage area, a workshop for locomotive repair; three aircraft landing fields along with",

It an Armadillo-class tanker designated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel.\nThe ship was the only ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the giraffe, a large ruminant mammal of Africa, having a very long neck that makes it the tallest of quadrupeds.  Her keel was laid down as Sanford B. Dole by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, in Wilmington, California.  She was launched on 11 November 1943 sponsored by Miss Mary F. Leddy and commissioned on 12 December 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Frederick F. Daly, USNR, commanding.\nFollowing shakedown, Giraffe put in at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, on 10 February 1944 and subsequently refueled warships at Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, Ulithi, and Palau before reaching Okinawa on 21 July 1945. She entered Sasebo, Japan, on 20 November at war's end and served the occupation fleet until departing Yokosuka on 21 February 1946 for Pearl Harbor and Norfolk, Virginia. Giraffe reached Norfolk 3 May and decommissioned there 17 June 1946. Returned to the War Department that date, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 July 1946. She was subsequently sold to Metro Petroleum Shipping Company, Inc.\nGiraffe was awarded two battle stars for World War II service.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhoto gallery of USS Giraffe at NavSource Naval History",

    "title": "California Music",
    "content": "California Music was an American rock supergroup that formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1974. It was originally a loose collective of studio musicians, with participation from Bruce Johnston, Terry Melcher, Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher, Dean Torrence, and Brian Wilson. Equinox Records released three singles by the group from 1974 to 1976, after which the band went inactive. In 2021, the group was reformed by members of the Beach Boys and their children. Omnivore Recordings released their first album: California Music Presents Add Some Music.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original iteration ===\nThe group was conceived by former Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher. Though still under contract to Warner Bros. Records, Brian Wilson signed a sideline production deal with Johnston and Melcher's Equinox Records in early 1975. Together, they attempted to establish the loose-knit music collective with Gary Usher and Curt Boettcher. Biographer John Tobler described the project as involving Johnston, Melcher, Wilson, Dean Torrence, \"and a few others ... who had recorded previously as the Legendary Masked Surfers.\" Wilson was paid a bonus advance of $25,000, described by Johnston as \"probably the highest production royalty any producer's ever received.\" Due to Wilson's irresponsible expenditures, his income had been redirected to the bank account of his wife Marilyn. According to biographer Timothy White, Wilson \"begged her\" to place the money in an account separate to hers.\n\nWilson was involved with California Music's renditions of \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" and \"Jamaica Farewell\", acting as co-producer, instrumentalist, and backing vocalist. Melcher spoke of his contributions: \"He wouldn't even touch anything in the control booth; he acted like he was afraid to. He'd offer suggestions, but he wouldn't go near the board. He knows his reputation, so he makes a lot of unfinished records; sometimes, I feel that he feels that he's peaked and does not want to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize.\" Melcher was reportedly \"crushed\" upon seeing Wilson in his poor mental and physical state, unable to recognize his former Wrecking Crew associates that Melcher had hired for the project. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Wilson refused to finish any more tracks for California Music.\nWilson remembered meeting Elvis Presley at RCA Victor Studio on the day of recording \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" and inviting the singer to listen to what they had recorded. According to Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling, \"After a few tracks, Brian says, 'Well? Do you think they're any good?' Elvis looks up and replies, 'Nah,' before leaving. I don't think he had any idea that the guy was Brian Wilson.\"\nPursuant to his contract with Warner Bros., Wilson was liable to be sued by the label if he did not contribute a certain percentage to the Beach Boys' studio recordings. Johnston recalled, \"Brian spent a day and night talking to us about it; he was really desperate for an outlet, because basically the deal at Warners was for the Beach Boys.\" At the behest of Marilyn, he was legally ousted from California Music in order to focus his undivided attention on the Beach Boys, who perceived the side project as Brian's attempt to pay for his growing drug expenses. Mike Love's brother and Beach Boys manager Stephen Love said, \"He [Brian] said to me 'Don't try to reach me! Don't try to get to me!' He was so upset Marilyn didn't want [the Equinox deal] to happen.\" The bonus advance was soon transferred to an account belonging to Marilyn at a different bank.\nIn the meantime, the Beach Boys' recent Endless Summer compilation was a great commercial hit, and the band — without Brian — was touring non-stop, making them the biggest live draw in the United States. According to Love: \"We were under contract with Warner Bros., and we couldn't have him going on a tangent. If he was going to be productive, it's gotta be for the Beach Boys.\" With Wilson gone, California Music immediately disintegrated. Afterward, Boettcher soon collaborated with Johnston and the Beach Boys on the 1979 disco version of their song \"Here Comes the Night\", which appeared on the album L.A. (Light Album) and marked Johnston's return to the Beach Boys.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\nIn 2021, a new iteration of California Music was organized and produced by David Beard, the editor and publisher of the Beach Boys fanzine Endless Summer Quarterly. The grouping consisted of Johnston and fellow Beach Boys Mike Love, Al Jardine, and David Marks, as well as children of the band members: Carnie and Wendy Wilson (daughters of Brian); Justyn Wilson (son of Carl); Christian, Hayleigh, and Ambha Love; and Matt Jardine. Their debut album, California Music Presents Add Some Music, was released via Omnivore Recordings on April 23, 2021. The re-recording of “Add Some Music To Your Day” was the first studio recording to feature Mike Love, Al Jardine, Johnston, and Mark",

    "title": "Transplacental carcinogenesis",
    "content": "Transplacental carcinogenesis is a series of genotypic and/or phenotypic changes in the cells of a fetus due to in utero exposure to carcinogens. Specifically, these changes are identified as malignant by virtue of their metastatic potential.\n\n\n== Transplacental transfer ==\nThe link between a pregnant mother and the fetus is such that \"at all sites of direct cell-to-cell contact, maternal tissues (decidua and blood) are juxtaposed to extraembryonic cells (trophoblast).” According to Cunningham, \"after conception, a biomolecular communication system is established between the fetus and mother that is operative from before the time of nidation and continues through and beyond the time of parturition.\" This communication system is essential to all facets of the pregnancy. \"Physiological processes such as fetal nutrition and fetal development progress directly from embryonic/fetal tissue-directed modifications of maternal responses.\" Notably, the placenta is the principal site of transfer between mother and fetus. A fetus is exposed via the placenta to all substances which are present in the peripheral circulation of the mother. Overall, the abundance of toxins contained within cigarette smoke that is inhaled by the mother exerts a direct impact by altering the placental and fetal cell proliferation and differentiation. The vital balance of cellular activity is disrupted. \"The association of in utero exposure to such carcinogens and the subsequent development of cancer has been reported for all childhood cancers combined and particularly for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors.\"\n\n\n== Fetal cell sensitivity ==\nFetal cells are most sensitive to carcinogens during the early stages of gestation. Notably, early in the gestational period, there is a high rate of cell division. Additionally, the cells exhibit undifferentiated characteristics. These compounding factors illustrate the basis for this heightened cellular sensitivity to genotoxic agents. For example, it has been proven that during exposure nicotine binds to receptors of the fetal cells through which developmentally important signaling occurs in many developing organs and tissues. Because the binding of these receptors is unanticipated by the regulated activity of the fetal cells it can be inferred that this is a disruption in the cellular process which can lead to detrimental effects such as the deregulation of vital signaling, expression, or repair. As indicated above, should this exposure occur during the early stages of gestation, the fetus will be more susceptible to such damage.  In addition to receptor binding, it has also been proven that fetal tissues are suspected as \"privileged targets of neoplastic changes\" in light of the vast amount of cell proliferation and differentiation taking place. Notably, tumors are arrived at via proliferating cells. In the event that proliferating cells become uncontrolled, by any measure, this mutated activity would certainly be characteristic of an increased risk in one's chances of developing cancer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMagee PN (October 1975). \"Transplacental carcinogenesis\".

    "title": "Fort William Sheriff Court",
    "content": "Fort William Sheriff Court is a judicial building on the High Street in Fort William in Scotland. The building, which continues to be used as a courthouse, is a Category C listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough sheriff court hearings have taken place in Fort William since 1794, a prison, with a courtroom, was only established in the town in 1849. In the early 1870s, court officials decided to commission a dedicated courthouse for the area. The site they selected was on the southeast side of the High Street, just to the west of the prison.\nThe new building was designed by James Matthews and William Lawrie in the Gothic Revival style, built in red sandstone and was completed in 1876. It was extended to the rear in the 1880s. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of three bays facing southwest down the High Street. The first bay on the left was fenestrated with a pair of arched windows with hood moulds on each floor, with a gable above. The second bay, which was projected forward, was fenestrated with a pair of arched windows with hood moulds on the ground floor, and with a set of the three arched windows with hood moulds on the first floor, with a gable containing a trefoil above. The right-hand bay was formed by a three-stage tower: there was an arched doorway with a hood mould in the first stage, an arched window with a hood mould in the second stage and a small blind window with a hood mould in the third stage, all surmounted by a frieze containing a quatrefoil and two trefoils, and pyramid-shaped roof with brattishing. Internally, the principal room was the courtroom, with a vaulted ceiling, on the first floor.\nAn extensive programme of refurbishment works was completed in 1996, enabling the building to continue to serve as the venue for sheriff court hearings in the area. In December 2000, the building was the venue for a fatal accident inquiry into the deaths of four venture scouts in an avalanche on Aonach Mòr in December 1998: the court found that the victims \"had died of asphyxiation\". Following a nationwide review of all Scottish court buildings, Historic Environment Scotland listed the building at Category C in 2015.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of listed buildings in Fort William, Highland\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "HMS Ark Royal (R09)",
    "content": "HMS Ark Royal (R09) was an Audacious-class aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy and, when she was decommissioned in 1979, was the Royal Navy's last remaining conventional catapult and arrested-landing aircraft carrier.  She was the first aircraft carrier to be equipped with an angled flight deck at its commissioning; her sister ship, HMS Eagle, was the Royal Navy's first angle-decked aircraft carrier after modification in 1954.  Ark Royal was the only non-United States vessel to operate the McDonnell Douglas Phantom at sea.\n\n\n== Construction and modifications ==\n\nArk Royal was the sister ship to HMS Eagle, which was initially named HMS Audacious, hence the name of the class.  Four Audacious-class ships were laid down, but two (HMS Africa and the original HMS Eagle) were cancelled when the Second World War ended, and construction of the other two was suspended for several years.  Both completed ships were extensively upgraded throughout their lifetimes.\nA contract was placed with Cammell Laird on the River Mersey on 19 March 1942, to build the first ship of the class.  While it had been originally planned to name the ship Irresistible, this was changed to Ark Royal before ordering to commemorate the aircraft carrier lost in 1941.  The ship, which was the largest warship ever to be built by Cammell Laird, was laid down at Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 3 May 1943, as yard number 1119.  Construction was slow, and was suspended after the end of the Second World War to allow the ship's design to be updated to better suit her for the operation of modern aircraft.  Ark Royal was launched by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, on 3 May 1950.  She was completed on 25 February 1952, and commissioned the next day at Devonport.\nIn this time, she underwent redesign and, when completed, she was markedly different from her sister ship.  Shortly before her launch from the Cammell Laird shipyard, an image of the ship painted with her white undercoat was captured by the pictorialist photographer E. Chambré Hardman.  This has been exhibited many times under the name 'Where Great Ships Are Built' and later 'Birth of the Ark Royal'.  When commissioned, she had a 5.5° partially angled flight deck, two steam catapults capable of launching aircraft weighing up to 30,000 pounds (14,000 kilograms), a deck-edge lift on the port side (the first British ship to be fitted with such a device), modified armament, and the new mirror landing system.  Ark Royal was the first ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck and steam catapults, as opposed to having them added after launching.  These innovations allowed aircraft to land and take off from the carrier at the same time.  Her flight deck as built was 800 by 112 feet (244 by 34 metres).\n\nA further four years passed before she commenced her sea trials.\nAbout a year after commissioning, her forward port 4.5 inches (110 mm) guns were removed to improve aircraft operations over the angled deck.  Four years later, the port deck-edge lift and the forward starboard 4.5 inch guns were also removed.  After the 1964 refit, only one twin 4.5 inch gun mount remained aft on port and starboard side.  From 1967 to February 1970, she underwent a refit which was a major rebuild to her structure, but only an austere update to her electronic equipment, and was confined to changes needed to operate the RN's version of the Phantom.  Prior to, and during the refit, concerns over costs, the age of the hull, and changing political opinions over naval requirements threatened the refit, and even a possibility that the ship could be scrapped.  However, convincing arguments to retain and upgrade the carrier won through.\nThe refit cost around £30 million, far less than the modernisation of Eagle, but also added several improvements, which allowed her to comfortably operate the larger Phantom and Buccaneer Mk.2 aircraft.  Her modifications included a full 8.5° angled flight deck, new and far more powerful steam catapults, bridle-catchers, heavy-grade jet-blast deflectors (both of which Eagle did not receive), and heavy-weight arrestor cables.  Twelve hundred miles of new cabling was installed, but the ship was not completely rewired and retained old DC electrics.  A modified island (with a different arrangement from Eagle), and a partially new electronic suite were also added, though some of her original radars, such as 983 height-finders were retained, and she did not receive the 3-D air-search radar set that her sister had fitted, instead two double-array 966 versions of the standard RN 965 long-range system were fitted and one of the new 986 sets.  Significantly, Ark Royal was the first and only RN carrier fitted with a USN carrier approach system, the AN/SPN-35 radar, increasing night aircraft operational capability and safety.  Her flight deck size was increased port aft, giving her extra deck-park space for her air group that Eagle did not have.  She was also fitted for four Seacat missile launchers, ",

Wolfgang Zeuss, Magnus Wochner, Emil Meier, Peter Straub, Fritz Hartjenstein, Franz Berg, Werner Rohde, Emil Bruttel, and Kurt Aus Dem Bruch were all accused of capital murder of British women sent to aid liaison officers in France. These women assisted in establishing communications between the resistance movement in France and London. The names of the victims were Andrée Borrel, Sonia Olschanezky, Vera Leigh and Diana Rowden. Two of these women were a part of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and the other two were a part of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. All four were sent by the SOE for French resistance efforts.\nThought to be spies of the Allied Powers, the Nazi regime detained them and eventually imprisoned them in the Natzweiler Camp. There, these women were allegedly inhumanely killed by lethal injection and then cremated while still living without trial. Major Bill Barkworth of the SAS and Vera Atkins of the SOE were in charge of the prosecution. Though under Articles 29 and 30 of the Hague Convention of 1907 the women were considered spies and therefore legally liable to execution, Article 30 states that no spy can be punished by execution until a trial has found them guilty. The Allied prosecution argued that the secrecy around the executions and the status of the prisoners as 'in protective custody' proved that no such trial had taken place.\n\n\n== Defendants' arguments and charges ==\nSource:\nAll of the accused were officials at the Natzweiler Camp except for Franz Berg who was imprisoned at the camp and worked the oven in the crematory. Horst Kopkow was the head of counterintelligence and was responsible for all SOE agents captured in France at the time. Kopkow was never tried because he had not yet been captured at the time of the investigation. By 1946, he  had been captured and was in British custody but was thought to have died of bronchial pneumonia. In 1948, the Allies realised that he had been sent to aid in Counterintelligence efforts against the Soviets for uses in the Cold War.\nFritz Hartjenstein was the Kommandant of the Natzweiler Camp and claimed that he was not present at the camp during the time of the executions and stated he had no idea that they were given the lethal injections. However, evidence was found that he was at a party in the camp during the same day of the killings. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life and then tried again for the hanging of a pilot in Natzweiler. He was sentenced to death and then extradited to France for another trial for the mass murder of prisoners. He was sentenced to death, but died on death row of a heart attack in 1954.\nWerner Rohde was a medical officer at the Natzweiler Camp and admitted that he was ordered by Officer Otto to inject one of the women. Officer Otto was found to not be an official at the camp and also evidence came out that Rohde was aware that the four British women never received a trial before the executions. Rohde was sentenced to death and was hanged on 11 October, 1946 at Hameln (Germany).\nOfficer Otto was never prosecuted because he had committed suicide when the war ended. Along with Rohde, Dr. Heinrich Plaza assisted in the executions using lethal injections. Plaza was never captured. In 1954, he was sentenced to death in absentia in France, but continued to live and practise as a doctor in Altötting (Bavaria). He died in 1968. \nPeter Straub was the SS officer in command for the executions. According to testimony Straub was said to be drunk the night of the executions because of a party thrown for the departure of Plaza. Straub was known to have bragged about injections given to other prisoners in the camp. Straub was executed on 11 October, 1946.\nFranz Berg was a prisoner in the camp who operated the crematorium oven. Berg was a recognised criminal with a record of up to 22 crimes. He stated that he never knew that anyone unusual was being cremated and that he was locked in his cell when the injections were being administered. He went on to state a fellow prisoner told him what was happening as the murders were taking place. His defence argument was that Straub told him to heat up the furnaces because he was in charge. Berg was sentenced to five years in prison. He was later found guilty at the Natzweiler trial and executed.\nMagnus Wochner was the political head of the Natzweiler Camp and was directly under orders of the Berl",

    "content": "Kipoi (Greek: Κήποι, before 1928: Μπάγια, Bagia) is a village in the region of Zagori. It belongs to the municipal unit of Tymfi, Ioannina regional unit, Greece. The village has the lowest altitude of all Zagori village and is surrounded by rivers. It is built on a rocky hill, in the southern end of Vikos Gorge.\n\n\n== Name ==\nLinguist Kostas Oikonomou writes the placename Bagia is related to the Albanian word bajë, baja 'bath', a term philologist Franz Miklosich says cannot be attributed with certainty to any language. On the contrary, linguist Gustav Meyer relates the word to the Slavic banja 'bath' from the Romanian baje 'mine, bathing place, source of mineral water'.\nOikonomou states the origin of the toponym is either directly from the Albanian noun 'bathing place', as there are many ponds in the village suitable for bathing, especially in the summer when the river water ceases to flow and is concentrated only in them, or from the personal name Bagias (and Vagias) which are considered to be of Albanian origin.\nThe new Greek name Kipoi is taken from a nearby toponym for fields where potatoes and other agricultural crops are cultivated.\n\n\n== History and culture ==\n\nKipoi was once the centre of Zagori. After the Balkan Wars and the liberation of Epirus in 1913, the people of Kipi demanded that Kipoi becomes the capital of Zagori, because it is the most central village and because it once was the \"capital\".\n\nIn Kipoi, the traditional architectural style of Epirus is well preserved, with stone built roads and dwellings. The village is surrounded by stone bridges. In the entrance lies Kontodimos bridge, down in the valley, the beautiful Milos bridge connects the village to the old water mill and Petsonis bridge in the exit towards Fragades. One can find more bridges on the old paths towards Elati, Dikorfo, Negades and Tsepelovo. Not far from the villages lies a three arched stone bridge, of the 18th century (illustration). The bridge is also a unique tourist attraction of today, on the local road to central Zagori, just out of the village.\nOrthodox Albanians, locally called \"Arvanites\", settled the village after the 15th century, later assimilating into the local population. Sarakatsani settled at the beginning of the 20th century.\nToday, the museum of the famous collector Agapios Tolis is located in Kipoi, where more than 40.000 exhibits are included.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKahl, Thede (1999). \"Die Zagóri-Dörfer in Nordgriechenland: Wirtschaftliche Einheit – ethnische Vielfalt\".

His paternal grandfather Charles Van Notten (1702–1750) of Amsterdam moved to London in 1720 and married Susanna Bosanquet. \nSir Peter Pole succeeded his father in 1813. He and his brother Charles had worked in the family Van Notten Bank of Devonshire Square, Bishopsgate since 1795, and the bank came to trade as Peter and Charles Van Notten and Co. In 1815 Pole became a partner in another bank, Down, Thornton & Free of Birchin Lane off Lombard Street.\nKeen to enter Parliament, Pole through his partner Peter Free consulted James Brogden about obtaining a pocket borough.

    "title": "Fontenelle Dam",
    "content": "Fontenelle Dam was built between 1961 and 1964 on the Green River in southwestern Wyoming. The 139-foot (42 m) high zoned earthfill dam impounds the 345,360-acre-foot (0.42600 km3) Fontenelle Reservoir. The dam and reservoir are the central features of the Seedskadee Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the Fontenelle impoundment primarily as a storage reservoir for the Colorado River Storage Project. The dam suffered a significant failure in 1965, when the dam's right abutment developed a leak. Emergency releases from the dam flooded downstream properties, but repairs to the dam were successful. However, in 1983 the dam was rated \"poor\" under Safety Evaluation of Existing Dams (SEED) criteria, due to continuing seepage, leading to an emergency drawdown. A concrete diaphragm wall was built through the core of the dam to stop leakage.\n\n\n== Use ==\nInitially conceived as a storage reservoir for irrigation water, the project was suspended for a time in 1962 to pursue a study of high-altitude irrigation methods. The results of the studies caused the cancellation of many irrigation features for the project. The primary project rationale evolved to support Wyoming water rights in the Colorado River basin, retaining water that would otherwise go downstream to states in the lower Colorado basin. The dam provides power generation as a secondary feature. One motivation for the deferral of irrigation activities was the discovery of trona in the southern portion of the proposed irrigated region. As the extraction of trona was a higher-value activity, the removal of those lands from the project made the irrigation project nonviable.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nDevelopment of the upper Green River basin was included in a 1946 Bureau of Reclamation report on the Colorado River basin. A 1950 supplementary report dealt with details of the proposed Seedskadee Project, followed by another addendum in 1953. The Colorado River Storage Project, including the Seedskadee Project, was authorized by Congress in 1956. Initial planning was completed in 1959, and amended in 1961 to increase the capacity of Fontenelle Reservoir to 345,400 acre-feet (0.4260 km3), making the construction of a powerplant feasible. Work was stopped on irrigation  infrastructure in 1962. The dam featured unusually large outlet works, capable of discharging 18,000 cu ft/s (510 m3/s) (compared with a spillway capacity of 20,200 cu ft/s (570 m3/s)) because the outlet works could be increased in size at lower cost than the spillway.\nThe first element of construction at Fontenelle Dam was the building of the Fortenelle community, the base camp for construction, with work starting in 1961 to build prefabricated relocatable houses for dam workers. The contract for the base camp was awarded to and completed by the D.H. Butcher & Co. construction company. The construction contract for the dam was awarded on June 13, 1961 to Foley Brothers, Inc. and the Holland Construction Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, with construction starting on June 30, at a cost of $7.9 million. The surface of the bedrock at the dam's base was found to be fragmented so the cut-off trench intended to preclude water infiltrating under the dam was deepened by 6 feet (1.8 m). The exposed rock was not prepared or smoothed with concrete. The foundation grouting required an unusually large amount of material to fill cracks in the upper 65 feet (20 m), with additional grouting required at the right abutment and outlet works.  Work on the dam was completed by the end on 1963, with final completion on April 24, 1964. Work on the powerplant started in 1963, with completion in 1965.\n\n\n== Partial failure ==\nProblems with the embankment became apparent in May 1964, when part of the backfill slid into the stilling basin downstream, attributed to too-fast lowering of the reservoir level. When the reservoir had filled to 10% of capacity, seepage became apparent at the dam's base, with further seepage observed about 4,000 feet (1,200 m) below the dam from shale outcroppings. In July 1965 another slide occurred in the area of the stilling basin.\nA significant leak appeared on September 3, 1965 at the west abutment, starting as a wet spot that grew with time.  The weakened downstream face lost 10,000 cubic yards (7,600 m3) of material that slid into the stilling basin, accompanied by continuing water flow, a condition known as \"hydraulic piping.\"  Work began the next day to lower the reservoir, with a 24-hour watch on the dam. The wet spot became a waterspout, flowing at a rate of between 10 and 12 million gallons per day.\nOn September 6 a 15-foot (4.6 m) by 20-foot (6.1 m) sinkhole developed on the upstream face of the dam's crest, which workers immediately filled with riprap bulldozed from the nearby dam surface into the hole. The hole was 30 feet (9.1 m) deep, with the bottom 11 feet (3.4 m) below the level of the reservoir, with only 45 feet (14 m) of dam structure remaining between the sinkhole a",

    "title": "Georg Abraham Schneider",
    "content": "Georg Abraham Schneider (19 April 1770 - 19 January 1839) was a German musician and composer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSchneider was born in Darmstadt, where he originally learnt music as a member of the city's alta cappella.  From 1787 he played horn in the court orchestra of the nobel house Hessen-Darmstadt, then from 1795 for the Prussian royal court.\nSchneider's compositions and performances focussed on the horn, and owe a stylistic debt to Haydn and Mozart. The invention of the valved horn by Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blühmel was of great interest to Schneider, allowing the instrument to be played chromatically for the first time.  In a report for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in 1817, Schneider wrote; \"Because of its full and strong, yet soft and attractive tone, the Waldhorn is an extremely beautiful instrument; but, as is well known, it has until now been far behind almost all other wind instruments in its development, being very restricted to its natural notes ....  Herr Stölzel of Breslau has now completely removed these shortcomings .... He has simply provided his horn with two airtight valves, which are depressed with little effort by two fingers of the right hand, like the keys of the pianoforte, and restored to their previous position by the same two fingers with the help of attached springs; with these it is not only possible but also easy to produce a pure and completely chromatic scale from the lowest to the highest notes with a perfectly even tone. On this horn, therefore, there is no need to change from one key to another, and the same passage can be repeated immediately in a different key; even passages which previously were absolutely impossible to play on the normal horn can now be performed without difficulty.\"  The development of these valves led to the development of the instrument now known as the French horn.\nSchneider wrote the first work for valved horn, which was performed publicly in 1818.  In 1820 he was promoted to royal director of music, then in 1825 appointed director of the Court Orchestra. In his later life he taught at the Prussian Academy of the Arts.\nSchneider's daughter Maschinka married Dresden composer François Schubert, and they had a daughter, singer and composer Georgina Schubert.\nHe died in Berlin in 1839.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nGeorg Abraham Schneider: Preußens Hofkapellmeister - Adorján Quartett, Label: Phil.harmonie\nSchneider: Flute Trios - Trio d'argent \nGeorg Abraham Schneider: Three Flute Concertos - Gaby Pas-Van Riet (flute), Württemberg Chamber Orchestra Heilbronn; Johannes Moesus - Label: CPO\nGeorg Abraham Schneider: 6 Solos for Viola, Op. 19 & Variations, Op. 44 (arranged for viola by Marco Misciagna) - Marco Misciagna, viola - Label: MM25, 2025\n\n\n== External links ==\nFree scores by Georg Abraham Schneider at the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)\n\n\n== References ==",

The band was described as \"walking the fine line between rootsy country and cutting-edge alternative rock\".  Scott Miller, John Paul Keith, and Mic Harrison were the primary songwriters for the band.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was formed in Knoxville in 1994, with guitarist/vocalist Scott Miller,  lead guitarist John Paul Keith, bassist Paxton Sellers, and drummer Jeff Bills.  They were originally named The Viceroys, but were forced to change it after being threatened with a lawsuit from a Jamaican band.\nBefore their first album was recorded, Keith left the band and was replaced by Mic Harrison.\n\n\n== Releases ==\nThe V-Roys first album, Just Add Ice was the first release on Steve Earle's E-Squared Records.  The title is a playful reference to their decision to remove the letters \"ice\" from \"The Viceroys\" as a result of the threatened lawsuit.  The album is described as a \"solid reflection of their live show\" and \"jangling, melancholy country–rock\".  The band recorded it \"live without a lot of bells and\nwhistles, to get something out as quick as we could and go out and support it\".\n1998's All About Town is a \"more subtle, but endlessly melodic\" album that saw the band \"stretch out and add elements of bluegrass and broader production values\".  Miller commented that Earle \"pushed us a lot harder and put his foot way up our asses this time\", and \"handed songs back to us if they weren't good enough\".  Allmusic describes the album as \"twelve concise songs that swing from the Creedence-ish \"Window Song\" to the country-folk of \"Mary\" to the sounds of Appalachia in \"Virginia Way\" to the great highway tune of \"Strange\".\nBoth of the band's studio albums were produced by Steve Earle and Ray Kennedy, known as the \"Twangtrust\". The band also had 3 tracks on the soundtrack to the film You Can Count on Me.\nAfter road-weariness, Earle losing interest, and reaching their creative peak, the band decided to break up.   They released a live album, Are You Through Yet?, recorded at a concert at the Down Home in Johnson City, Tennessee.  The album is complimented as \"a marvelous send-off, but it also provides a fine introduction to the group for those who missed them the first time around\".\nThe band played what was then called their final show at the historic Tennessee Theatre on New Year's Eve, 1999.\n\n\n== Reunion ==\nIn July 2011, it was announced that the band then would be releasing a compilation album on Miller's record label. The album, Sooner or Later features songs from their two studio albums, and previously unreleased tracks. They also played a concert on New Year's Eve 2011 in Knoxville.  The show was called \"One Show; Goodbye\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe band was described as \"a critically acclaimed, commercially under appreciated\" band with a \"tasty brand of roots rock\".\nTheir live show was often complimented. It was illustrated as shows that \"swung from honky-tonk pathos to punk-ish ferocity, and by the end of a show it was sometimes hard to tell one from the other\".  The band was particularly popular locally; shows were described as \"genuine events, with advance tickets, sold-out clubs\".  Just Add Ice was said to be the best selling album in ten years at a Knoxville record store.\nThe V-Roys were named the best Knoxville band ever in a 2009 poll conducted by Knoxville's weekly newspaper Metro Pulse. The voters were members of the Knoxville music industry.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "German Alpine Club",
    "content": "The German Alpine Club (German: Deutscher Alpenverein, DAV for short) is the world's largest climbing association and the eighth-largest sporting association in Germany. It is a member of the German Olympic Sports Confederation and the competent body for sport and competition climbing, hiking, mountaineering, hill walking, ice climbing, mountain expeditions, as well as ski mountaineering. It is an association made up of local branches known as 'sections'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe German Alpine Club was founded as Bildungsbürgerlicher Bergsteigerverein on 9 May 1869 in Munich by 36 former members of the Austrian Alpine Club around the Ötztal curate Franz Senn. It was founded in order to promote the development of tourism in the Eastern Alps through the building of mountain huts, and establishment of hiking trails, and via ferratas. The association had a large membership from the beginning, attracting 1,070 members in the first ten months.\n\nThe German and the Austrian societies merged in 1873 to form the German and Austrian Alpine Club (DÖAV). By the late 19th century, the association's policies became increasingly nationalistic and anti-Semitic. In 1899, the Brandenburg section amended an \"Aryan paragraph\" to exclude non-Christian members, followed by the Vienna section in 1905 and the Alpine associations of Vienna in 1907 and Munich in 1910. After World War I, Jewish members, including Viktor Frankl and Fred Zinnemann, who made up one third of the membership, were banned in most branches. They, in turn, established a separate Donauland section, insisting on recognition by the DÖAV. The Donauland members were officially ousted in 1924. Jews were even banned from using the DÖAV mountain huts.\nFollowing Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, the DÖAV, under the leadership of Arthur Seyss-Inquart, was renamed as the Deutscher Alpenverein (DAV) and was incorporated into the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise) as its mountaineering association. After World War II, the DAV was dissolved by the Allied authorities. Its assets were held by the Austrian Alpine Club, acting as trustees.\nThe German Alpine Club was re-established in 1952. It joined the Deutscher Sportbund in 1992. After leaving the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme in 2008 due to differences of opinion regarding competitive and recreational sports, the German and Austrian Alpine Clubs rejoined the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme in 2013.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe DAV is an umbrella organization comprising 356 legally independent regional sections with a total of around 1.5 million members. Every branch is a registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein, e.V.) in its own right and solely responsible for admitting members. The collective body of the branches is represented by the general assembly, association council, and presidium.\nThe primary task of the Club is the maintenance of its mountain huts through its sections which currently provide 325 alpine club huts for hikers and mountaineers as well as 220 indoor climbing gyms. The DAV publishes DAV Panorama magazine, Alpine Club maps and Alpine Club Guides in cooperation with Bergverlag Rother, organises hill walks and alpine-style tours, makes mountaineering equipment available to rent and arranges collective insurance. It also runs the Alpine Museum on Prater Island in Munich. In recent years, the Club's policies have shifted towards habitat conservation, with a particular focus on the protection of the fauna and flora of the Alps.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAnneliese Gidl: Alpenverein.

The book was edited and written by Lawrence Miles, and co-authors include Simon Bucher-Jones, Daniel O'Mahony, Ian McIntire, Mags L. Halliday, Helen Fayle, Philip Purser-Hallard, Kelly Hale, Jonathan Dennis, and Mark Clapham.\n\n\n== Content ==\nDespite there being various plots and subplots within the book, it is primarily a guide to the many important factions involved with the War in Heaven. These include Faction Paradox itself, the Great Houses, the Celestis, the Remote, and Posthumanity. A number of hints about the mysterious Enemy against whom the Great Houses are fighting are scattered throughout the text, but nothing conclusive is ever stated. The book details many individuals, events, technologies, and concepts related to the War.\nThe book makes references to the Doctor Who novels Alien Bodies, Interference, The Taking of Planet 5, and The Shadows of Avalon, and it features the characters Compassion and Chris Cwej, who first appeared in Interference and Original Sin. A number of other parallels with Doctor Who characters and concepts can be found, but these links are not explicit. No familiarity with Doctor Who is required to appreciate The Book of the War.\n\nCharacters and settings from The Book of the War appear in later Faction Paradox novels including Of the City of the Saved..., Warring States and Newtons Sleep, and the short story anthology A Romance in Twelve Parts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe otherwise unrelated novel Dictionary of the Khazars is a rare example of similar use of a non-linear encyclopedic structure for a work of fiction.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is a Canadian art historian who places curatorial collaboration at the centre of her practice.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBruce was born and grew up in Montreal. She received her Honours BA in Art History from Queen's University, Kingston (1989) and her MA in Canadian Art History from Carleton University, Ottawa (1999). From 1991 to 1992, she served as Acting Registrar of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Queen's University, then went to the Art Gallery of Hamilton (AGH), as Registrar in 1993. She was appointed Curator of Historical Art in 1999 and in 2015, Director of Exhibitions and Collections.\nShe has focused on Canadian historical art in exhibitions ranging from biography with her show of the Canadian artist Harriet Ford (2001) to her exhibition and publication on the history of the Art Gallery of Hamilton's historical Canadian collection Lasting Impressions: celebrated works from the Art Gallery of Hamilton (2005) which she co-authored to her co-curated exhibition William Kurelek: The Messenger (2011) which was the first retrospective of his art in a quarter century and the largest ever mounted. In the same year, she also co-curated The French Connection: Canadians at the Paris Salons, 1880–1900.\nIn 2014, after three years of research and two trips to Sweden and France, she curated her major retrospective and co-authored the book Into the Light: The Paintings of William Blair Bruce (1859–1906), to examine the artist from different viewpoints (indigenous included) to achieve diversity. In 2015, she co-curated The Artist Herself: Self-Portraits by historical Canadian women artists (2015) with Alicia Boutilier of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. This exhibition expanded the genre's definition by using not only the human face but other art forms to explore self-representation. Her 2021 exhibition Tom Thomson: The Art of Authentication co-curated and authored again with Boutilier, established criteria to authenticate a work of art, taking as its focus the work of Tom Thomson and exhibiting possible Thomsons and known fakes to illustrate the help authentication can provide. The exhibition was called a \"rewarding experience\" as an examination of authentication and forgery in art, using Tom Thomson as case in point. The show was rated one of the best exhibitions of the season by the Art Institute of Canada because it gave insight into the extensive problem-solving that museum professionals undertake in tracing authenticity.\nBruce has contributed a chapter to Canada and Impressionism: New Horizons at the National Gallery of Canada (2019) and also has written entries to such exhibitions as Embracing Canada: Landscapes from Krieghoff to the Group of Seven, Vancouver Art Gallery (2015) and Uninvited, Canadian Women Artists in the Modern Movement, McMichael Canadian Art Collection (2021). Her lectures on Canadian art include one on \"Canadian Art-Making and Making Art Exhibitions\" to a panel of Archivists, Librarians and Curators at the Art Libraries Society of North America 40th Annual Conference, Toronto (2012) and \"On Prudence Heward\" in 2021. She has been an Adjunct Lecturer in Canadian Art History at McMaster University, Hamilton, since 2016 and has served on the Board of Trustees, Association of Art Museum Curators (2017–2020; 2020–2022).\n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "USS Salmon (SSR/SS/AGSS-573), a Sailfish-class submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the salmon.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nSalmon was the second of a class of two radar picket submarines, which were the largest conventionally-powered submarines in the United States Navy since the USS Argonaut (SM-1) of 1928. She was equipped with BPS-2 and BPS-3 radars in and aft of the sail. Intended to scout in advance of aircraft carrier groups using long-range radar, the Sailfish class were designed for a high surface speed. However, they achieved a speed only a few knots higher than converted World War II radar picket submarines.\nSalmon was laid down on 10 March 1954 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 25 February 1956, sponsored by Mrs. Albert M. Bontier, widow of Commander A. M. Bontier, who was lost during World War II when the submarine USS Seawolf (SS-197) was sunk during a war patrol in the South Pacific early in October 1944. Salmon was commissioned on 26 August 1956.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== 1956–1959 ===\nSalmon conducted her shakedown cruise between 19 February and 10 May 1957, ranging from Newport, Rhode Island, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She departed Portsmouth for the West Coast in late May, transited the Panama Canal on 3 July; visited Callao, Peru; and proceeded to San Diego, California, arriving on 25 July.\nSalmon conducted local operations in southern California waters, as a unit of Submarine Division 33 (SubDiv 33), until she began her first western Pacific deployment on 23 September. She sailed via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island to join the Seventh Fleet off southern Japan on 19 October. For the remainder of the year she participated in fleet training exercises and special operations, with port calls at Yokosuka, Japan; Hong Kong; Manila and Subic Bay, Philippines; and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Salmon departed Yokosuka on 31 March 1958 and returned to San Diego, California, on 19 April.\nResuming local operations, Salmon remained in the San Diego area for the rest of the year. From 6 January 1959 until 30 May, she underwent overhaul and limited conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Giving up a large radome from her superstructure, she gained instrumented Regulus missileguidance capability and improved, longer range sonar. Salmon then prepared for her second WestPac deployment.\nSalmon departed San Diego, California, on 17 July and sailed to Pearl Harbor where her crew received Regulus missile guidance training, then proceeded to Japan and joined Seventh Fleet on 21 August. She operated with the fleet in Allied training exercises, provided services for other Seventh Fleet surface and subsurface units for training purposes, and made visits to various ports, before returning to San Diego on 14 February 1960.\n\n\n=== 1960–1970 ===\nThrough 1960 and 1961, Salmon operated from San Diego, California, with occasional visits to San Francisco, California, Astoria, Oregon, Tacoma, Washington, Port Angeles, Washington, and Esquimalt, British Columbia. On 1 March 1961, she was reclassified an attack submarine and given hull classification symbol SS-573, and, on 1 November, she was reassigned to SubDiv 52.  The submarine radar picket mission ended fleetwide at this time as airborne radar superseded it with the full deployment of the Grumman WF-2 Tracer.\nOn 1 June 1962, Salmon departed San Diego for her third WestPac deployment. She visited Papeete, Tahiti, from 13 to 16 June, then proceeded to Yokosuka for duty with Seventh Fleet. She subsequently operated with antisubmarine warfare (ASW) hunter-killer groups in fleet exercises and often engaged in free-play battle problems with individual surface units. During this deployment, she visited Hakodate and Sasebo, Japan; Naha, Okinawa and Hong Kong. Salmon returned to San Diego, California, on 20 December and became flagship of Submarine Flotilla 1; and, in addition to that distinction, was awarded the Golden \"E\" for excellence in battle efficiency for the past five consecutive years, which rated her as the leading submarine of her division. Salmon was the first submarine to earn a Golden \"E\" and was to better that record by winning hashmarks signifying retention of that status during 1963 and 1964.\nOn the fourth of July in 1963, the Salmon suffered personnel casualties when mercury from a broken thermometer came into contact with a hot grid, creating toxic mercury vapor, resulting in the poisoning of 14 crewmembers.\nOn 3 June of the latter year, she put into the San Francisco Naval Shipyard to undergo FRAM II conversion.  Departing the yard on 19 April 1965, as a modernized \"GUPPY III\", she moved to the Puget Sound, Washington, area for evaluation and sound tests. She then returned to San Diego, to resume local operations, on 4 May.\nSalmon commenced her fourth WestPac deployment on 23 August.

    "content": "Takayama Castle (高山城, Takayama-jō) of Aki Province was a yamajiro-style Japanese castle located in what is today the Hongō neighborhood of the city of Mihara in Hiroshima Prefecture. Its ruins have been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1957.\n\n\n== History ==\nUnder Minamoto no Yoritomo, Doi Sanehira was awarded for his achievements in the Genpei War against the Heike clan, and was appointed governor of the three provinces of Bizen, Bitchu and Bingo. Sanehira's son Enpei took the name of \"Kobayakawa\", which was the place name of his residence, but was subsequently awarded the Numata shōen in Aki Province for his distinguished service in the Jōkyū War and relocated to Aki. His grandson, Kobayakawa Shigehira completed Takayama Castle in 1206 as the clan's stronghold. The Nuta Kobayakawa clan was the main line and ruled from Takayama Castle, and the Takehara Kobayakawa clan was a cadet branch.\nFrom the middle of the 16th century, the Ouchi clan, which ruled Suo and Nagato Provinces became the strongest warlord in the western half of Japan, supported by its monopoly of foreign trade. The Takahara-Kobayakawa gained in power through an alliance with the Ouchi, whereas the Nuta-Kobayakawa was rent by internal conflicts. Takayama Castle was on the front line of the conflict between the Ouchi clan and their aggressive neighbors to the north, the Amago clan. In defending against the Amago, the Nuta Kobayakawa clan lost three consecutive leaders in youth by illness or battle. In 1540, when the Amago again invaded Aki, the Takehara-Kobayakawa switched sides, but the Amago were defeated. The Ouchi clan seized Takayama Castle and much of the Kobayakawa territory. Around this time, the inlet to the Seto Inland Sea became silted up, adding to the clan's financial woes.\nIn 1541, the head of the Takehara-Kobayakawa branch (Kobayakawa Okikage) died without an heir, so the clan adopted the third son of Mōri Motonari as Kobayakawa Takakage in 1544. On the other hand, the head of the Nuta-Kobayakawa clan (Kobayakawa Shigehira) was young and in such poor health that he became blind, so he was forced into retirement, and Kobayakawa Takakage united the two branches in 1550. In 1552, he relocated his stronghold to a new castle, Niitakayama Castle on the opposite side of the Nuta River, and the Takayama Castle was abandoned.\nTakayama Castle was built on Mount Tsumataka, a 150-meter height overlooking the Nuta River, about 10 kilometers west of current center of Mihara city. On the opposite of the river is Mount Niitaka of similar height, and these two mountains stand like the pillars of gate. Originally there was an inlet with a length of over 10 kilometers from current river mouth on the Seto Inland Sea to just the below of the castle. This was an important port for the clan, which was also a maritime power on the Seto Inland Sea.  Mount Tsumataka has two lines of ridges extending north and south. The northern ridge is the core part of the castle, which consisted of several enclosures protected by stone walls and dry moats. The total size of the castle was about 600 meter long and 400 meter wide.\nAt present, no structures of the castle survive. The site is a 20-minute walk from JR West Hongō Station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Hiroshima)\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Lange, William (2021).

    "content": "The Mysterious Monsters (also known as Bigfoot: The Mysterious Monster) is a 1976 documentary film written and directed by Robert Guenette about the cryptids Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Yeti. It contained content from Guenette’s made-for-TV movie Monsters! Mysteries or Myths?  that aired on CBS on November 25, 1974. That version had been produced by David L. Wolper in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and was narrated by Rod Serling.\nThe Mysterious Monsters was one of the first theatrical releases produced by Sunn Classic Pictures. It was narrated by actor Peter Graves. The film investigated not only the possibility of Bigfoot's existence but also of the Loch Ness Monster and the Yeti (the Abominable Snowman). It featured dramatic reenactments of various reported Bigfoot sightings. The film showed one witness being given a lie detector test, another being placed under hypnosis. The Mysterious Monsters was the first movie to feature the home movie taken by Roger Patterson in 1967 reported to show a Bigfoot. Anthropologist Grover Krantz was interviewed and said he believed the film to be authentic. Famed Bigfoot hunter Peter C. Byrne was also featured and gave insights on the hunt. In discussing the Loch Ness Monster, the film showed a 1934 photograph that was said to be of the creature. In 1994, however, this photo was proven to be a hoax.\nRobert and Frances Guenette are credited as the authors of a 160-page book adaption of the film.\nThe film was later featured in an episode of Cinema Insomnia.\n\n\n== DVD release ==\nOn September 22, 2009, Cheezy Flicks released the film on DVD. In 2010, Apprehensive Films made the Cinema Insomnia version available also on DVD. The DVD cover is a visual reference to the 1978 Marvel Star Wars comic Star Wars 13: Day of the Dragon Lords.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBigfoot in popular culture\nPeter C.

    "title": "Dequindre Cut",
    "content": "The Dequindre Cut is a below-grade pathway, formerly a Grand Trunk Western Railroad line, located on the east side of Detroit, Michigan, just west of St. Aubin Street. Much of the Cut has been converted to a greenway; the colorful graffiti along the pathway has been left in place.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe railroad line that once ran through the Dequindre Cut runs roughly northwest/southeast at street level through Hamtramck and on to Royal Oak. The Cut begins south of Mack Avenue and runs along the east edge of the Eastern Market. The grade separation gradually increases heading south. It eventually reaches and stays 25 feet beneath grade until it enters the riverfront area south of Jefferson Avenue.\nA substantial portion of the Cut has been converted into a greenway. The greenway runs from Mack Avenue south to Woodbridge Street, between Jefferson Avenue and the Detroit River. The Dequindre Trail connects the Cut between Woodbridge Street and the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor along the International Riverfront.\nThe greenway currently houses a paved path with separate lanes for both pedestrians and bicycles. Access ramps to the Cut have been constructed at Lafayette Street, Gratiot Avenue, and Wilkins Street. Graffiti on the bridge abutments along the trail were intentionally left in place during the construction of the greenway.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe rail line was built in the 1830s by the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad, a predecessor of Canadian National Railway subsidiary Grand Trunk Western Railroad. By the 1920s, there were over 400 industries operating on Detroit's east side. However, the combination of the city's haphazard street plan, the expansion of large factories, and the substantial network of rail tracks conspired to slow traffic within the city, particularly in the east-west direction. In 1923, the city of Detroit and the railroad began a plan to build 22 grade separations; both parties agreed to share the cost.\nOne of the tracks to be regraded was the line paralleling St. Aubin. These tracks ran from the northwest, where they connected with a network of other lines, to the southeast, where the tracks turned to parallel the river and supplied a number of large factories, including the Detroit-Michigan Stove Plant, the United States Rubber Company Plant, and the Parke-Davis Research Laboratory. The tracks terminated at the Brush Street Station in downtown Detroit.\nBy March 1930, sixteen of the crossings of the Dequindre Cut were finished, including the Chestnut Street Bridge; the nearby Antietam Avenue Bridge was completed soon thereafter. These two bridges are particularly significant in their illustration of the construction of the time and their relationship to the right-of-way below.\nAs the century progressed, rail usage declined. Passenger service through the Cut was discontinued in 1982, and freight service continued only a few years beyond that. In 1998-2000, Canadian National sold the 3.5-mile section of track (including the Cut) south of their main line. During this time of abandonment, the Dequindre Cut was used by graffiti artists, attracted by the concrete bridge abutments and overpasses which protected the art from the weather, as well as the out-of-the-way location. The resulting art included some graffiti masterpieces. These pieces of art have continued since the transformation of the railway, such as a pair of murals created by the Hygienic Dress League Corporation.\nIn the late 1990s, when casinos were first authorized to be built in Detroit, the Dequindre Cut was considered as a freeway access to their proposed riverfront location. However, the casinos were built elsewhere, leaving the fate of the Dequindre Cut open. In 2003, the GreenWays Initiative granted the Downtown Detroit Partnership $98,750 to put plans in motion to remake the Dequindre Cut as a greenway. The project was later funded by another $3.4 million in grants, and groundbreaking began in 2005. The first stretch of greenway, a 1.2–mile section encompassing most of the Dequindre Cut, opened in 2009.\nConstruction began in September 2013 to build the remaining greenway half mile section from Mack Avenue to Gratiot. This segment includes a trail entrance into Eastern Market along the northwest side of the Wilkins Street bridge. This extension is part of the Link Detroit project which is funded through various sources including a $10 million TIGER grant. Though the greenway was originally due to be completed in 2014, unexpected underground utilities delayed its opening. The completed extension opened to the public in April 2016.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCycling in Detroit\nAntoine Dequindre\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDequindre Cut map from the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy.",

    "content": "Domino is a 2019 crime thriller film directed by Brian De Palma and starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Carice van Houten, Guy Pearce and Eriq Ebouaney. It is an international co-production filmed on-location across Europe. It tells the story of Danish police officer Christian Toft (Coster-Waldau), who is seeking justice for the murder of his partner Lars Hansen by the vengeful Ezra Tarzi (Ebouaney), hampered by his target being a CIA informant.\nIn the United States, it was released direct-to-VOD on 31 May 2019 by Saban Films but received theatrical releases in other territories. It received generally negative reviews. De Palma has expressed discontent with the final film, revealing that considerable sections of the original script were not filmed as intended due to production issues.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nCopenhagen police officers Christian Toft and Lars Hansen are sent to check out a reported domestic disturbance in an apartment. When they arrive, they find a man trying to leave the building with blood on his shoes. Toft assumes he's the domestic assailant and handcuffs him. Hansen sends Toft upstairs to go check on the man's wife when Toft realizes he accidentally left his gun at home. He takes Hansen's and goes upstairs, only to find the apartment filled with firearms, plastic explosives and a man lying dead with his throat slit and fingers removed. Using a hidden knife, the assailant breaks free from his restraints and attacks Hansen, inadvertently cutting his throat. The wounded Hansen tells Toft to give chase before losing consciousness. Toft pursues the assailant across the rooftop, but both fall into several stories. While Toft lies incapacitated, he sees three men come up and knock the assailant out before taking him away.\nThe police identify the assailant from fingerprints as Ezra Tarzi, a Libyan emigrant and former Special Forces operative whose parents had been killed by Salah Al-Din, an ISIS commander known as \"Sheikh\". Al-Din, who smuggles weapons and explosives through a tomato importer based in Brussels, is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks which he films and edits before posting them online. Tarzi's victim, Farooq Hares, was one of Al-Din's lieutenants, and Tarzi was trying to get to him. Toft wants to pursue Tarzi to bring him to justice but is suspended by his superior Detective Wold after he learns that Toft misplaced his service weapon, and is interrogated by internal affairs inspector Alex Boe.\nMeanwhile, Tarzi and his family have been abducted by CIA agent Joe Martin, who has relentlessly pursued Al-Din ever since he killed five of his colleagues years earlier. Martin pressures a reluctant Tarzi into working on his behalf by threatening to reveal his murderous deeds to his children. He sends him first after Hares' nephew Yusuf in Copenhagen but during the struggle, Yusuf breaks loose and throws himself to his death. Tarzi manages to find several hidden cellphones in the apartment, from which Martin traces calls from a restaurant in Almería. They deduce that Al-Din intends to use a ferry to escape to friendly territory in North Africa, where he'll be effectively untraceable. Tarzi travels to Almería and attempts to find Al-Din by torturing one of his underlings, but gets nothing.\nDespite being suspended, Toft remains resolute in finding Tarzi. Along with Boe, who also wants to avenge Hansen, the two travel unsupervised to Brussels, but during the drive receive a phone call from Hansen's wife Hanne that Lars has died in hospice. Heartbroken, Boe reveals that she and Lars had been having an affair and he'd been intending to divorce Hanne and start a family with her. When a shocked Toft pushes back, Boe reveals intimate photos of the two together and an ultrasound, indicating she's carrying his child.\nToft and Boe fail to find leads in Brussels but learn that Tarzi has been spotted in Almería and quickly change course for southern Spain. As they're driving from the airport, they spot one of Al-Din's tomato delivery trucks and Toft deduces the connection. They follow the truck, eventually stumbling across Al-Din himself in another. They follow him to a bullfighting arena, where he and several others splinter off into the ring and nearby building. Toft follows Al-Din to the roof of the building, while Boe follows the others into the arena, where she spots one of them causing a distraction while another gets into a strategic location. Al-Din's men fly a camera drone into the arena, intending to film their comrade's suicide bombing. Just in the nick of time, Toft and Boe realize what is happening and intervene, shooting Al-Din in the process.\nBoe calls Wold, who in turn calls Martin, who proposes a trade—Tarzi for Al-Din. They meet on the rooftop, but Al-Din dies from his wounds. A distraught Tarzi asks Toft to kill him, but Martin makes clear that he intends to use the vengeful assassin as an asset for years to come. Suddenly, Boe arrives and shoots and kills Tarzi, avenging Lars. A disappoint",

    "content": "Kanō Tan'yū (狩野 探幽; Japanese pronunciation: [ka.noː (|) ta(ꜜ)ɰ̃.jɯː], 4 March 1602 – 4 November 1674) was a Japanese painter of the Kanō school. One of the foremost Kanō painters of the Tokugawa period, many of the best known Kanō works today are by Tan'yū.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHis original given name was Morinobu; he was the eldest son of Kanō Takanobu and grandson of Kanō Eitoku.\nIn 1617, Tan'yū was appointed by the Tokugawa shogunate to become the shogunate's first official painter. Over the following years, he was given many highly prestigious commissions. Over the 1620s and 1630s, he created a number of large-scale works for Edo Castle, Nijō Castle, Osaka Castle, Nagoya Castle, and Nikkō Tōshō-gū.\nProlific in a variety of painting styles, Tan'yū's most famous works are probably those he produced for these large-scale commissions. They are screens and panels, prime examples of the Momoyama style, depicting natural subjects such as tigers, birds and plants, in bright colors and with extensive use of gold leaf. The gold, often used to represent clouds, water, or other background elements, would reflect what little light was available indoors, brightening a castle's dark rooms. Moreover his dignified portrayal of figures appear in Confucius and Two Disciples, a screen painting now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\nTan'yū was also accomplished, however, in monochrome ink painting based on the prototypical style of the Muromachi period, yamato-e compositions in a style similar to that of the Tosa school, and Chinese style scrolls. His most famous yamato-e work is a narrative handscroll depicting the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shōgun and major figure in Japanese history. It was after this commission, in 1640, that the artist first took on the \"artist name\" of Tan'yū. His works decorated the walls of numerous palaces and castles, including Nijō Castle in Kyōto, the shogun’s castle at Nagoya, and the Kyōto Imperial Palace.\nIn addition to being a highly honored and respected painter in his own right, Tan'yū was known as a collector and connoisseur of Chinese paintings. He made sketches and kept records of many of the paintings that passed through his studio, brought to him for authentication.\nHe died in 1674 at the age of 72.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKusumi Morikage\n\n\n== References ==\n\nKaputa, Catherine (1985). \"Kanō Tan'yū.\" Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, Tokyo: Kodansha Ltd.\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrief Biography of Kano Tanyu - Jyuluck-Do Corporation\nWorks in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",

    "title": "German submarine U-78 (1940)",
    "content": "German submarine U-78 was a Type VIIC submarine of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was the only German submarine to be sunk by land-based artillery fire during the war. Built by Bremen-Vegesack.\nShe was ordered on 25 January 1939, and laid down on 28 March 1940, in the shipyard of Bremer Vulkan in the port city of Bremen-Vegesack as yard number 6. U-78 was launched on 7 December 1940 and formally commissioned  into the Kriegsmarine as a \"school boat\" on 15 February 1941, with a crew of 41 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Alfred Dumrese.\n\n\n== Design ==\nGerman Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-78 had a displacement of 769 tonnes (757 long tons) when at the surface and 871 tonnes (857 long tons) while submerged. She had a total length of 67.10 m (220 ft 2 in), a pressure hull length of 50.50 m (165 ft 8 in), a beam of 6.20 m (20 ft 4 in), a height of 9.60 m (31 ft 6 in), and a draught of 4.74 m (15 ft 7 in). The submarine was powered by two MAN M 6 V 40/46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower (2,060 to 2,350 kW; 2,760 to 3,160 shp) for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri & Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower (550 kW; 740 shp) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.23 m (4 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres (750 ft).\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.7 knots (32.8 km/h; 20.4 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7.6 knots (14.1 km/h; 8.7 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 80 nautical miles (150 km; 92 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km; 9,800 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). U-78 was fitted with two 53.3 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes at the bow, fourteen torpedoes, one 8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a 2 cm (0.79 in) C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.\n\n\n== Service history ==\nU-78 spent the majority of her career as a training U-boat, during which time she had several different crews. As a result, she never sank any enemy vessels nor engaged any enemy ships or convoys. On 1 March 1945, she was transferred to the 4th U-boat Flotilla but never saw any combat; prior to beginning her first patrol she was sunk on 16 April 1945. U-78's fate is notable in that she was the only German U-boat to be sunk by land-based artillery fire during World War II.\n\n\n=== Use as a training boat ===\nU-78 spent almost her entire career as part of the 22nd U-boat Flotilla as a \"school boat\", a role which saw her being used to train U-boat crews. During this time, her commander was changed six times: in July 1941 from Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Alfred Dumrese to Oberleutnant zur See (O/L) Kurt Makowski, who remained in command until February 1942 when she was handed over to Kptlt. Max Bernd Dieterich; in July 1942, Kptlt. Ernst Ziehm took command of the U-boat from Dieterich in November 1942. Kptlt. Helmut Sommer took command from Ziehm in May 1943; the sixth commander of U-78 took control of the U-boat when Wilhelm Eisele was named captain and lastly, the seventh commander, O/L Horst Hübsch, took command of U-78 from Eisele on 27 November 1944. All of U-78's changes of command took place while the U-boat was still serving as a training boat. Crewmembers used her as a practice submarine before being assigned to their operational U-boat.\n\n\n=== Sinking ===\nBy March 1945, the war was coming to an end, the Kriegsmarine was faced with a dwindling number of active U-boats. To offset this, the Navy looked to transfer boats away from other duties, such as training. On 1 March 1945, U-78 began active service with the 4th U-boat Flotilla. Just a month and a half later, however, on 16 April 1945, U-78 was sunk after being attacked by Soviet land-based artillery while she was docked near the electricity supply pier in the German port of Pillau in East Prussia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHelgason, Guðmundur. \"The Type VIIC boat U-78\".

    "title": "Cooper Basin",
    "content": "The Cooper Basin is a Permian-Triassic sedimentary geological basin in Australia. The intracratonic rift basin is located mainly in the southwestern part of Queensland and extends into northeastern South Australia. It is named after the Cooper Creek which is an ephemeral river that runs into Lake Eyre. For most of its extent, it is overlain by the Eromanga Basin. It covers 130,000 km2.\nThe surface of the Cooper Basin is mostly desert, including parts of the Simpson Desert, the Channel Country  and Sturt Stony Desert. Oil and gas exploration of the basin began in 1962.\n\n\n== Energy resources ==\n\n\n=== Oil and natural gas ===\nThe Cooper Basin has the most important on-shore petroleum and natural gas deposits in Australia. The oil and gas window is located 1,250 m below the surface  and was originally discovered in the 1960s (although there are larger oil and gas deposits off-shore). The first commercial discovery of gas occurred in 1963. It includes Australia's largest onshore oil field, the Jackson oil field. This field was discovered in 1981. Pipelines transport gas to the major markets of Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney. Overall about 1,800 petroleum wells have been drilled.\n\nThe largest producer in the basin is Santos with its main production facility at Moomba, South Australia at the head of the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System. The oil and gas deposits in the Cooper Basin tend to be fairly small and fragmentary, but highly economical given the relatively low cost of drilling and completion. Overall there are 160 gas fields and 75 oil fields in production containing about 630 producing gas wells and more than 340 producing oil wells.  There are many small listed companies exploring for additional deposits in the region.  Some of these companies are Austin Exploration, Cooper Energy, Beach Energy, Senex Energy, Bridgeport Energy, Strike Energy, Bengal Energy, Acer Energy, Magellan, Impress Energy, Red Sky Energy and many others.\n\n\n=== Geothermal ===\nWithin the basin, exploration companies have conducted extensive research to discover if the area is appropriate for large-scale production.  They have drilled and measured the temperature in many holes, estimating that hot granite rocks at 3.5 km deep are 240 °C. The Cooper Basin has been selected for the site of a geothermal project, because these rocks are the hottest in the world at economic drilling depths and away from volcanoes. During reservoir stimulation in 2003, induced seismic events up to magnitude 3.7 were observed.\n\n\n== Impact crater ==\nThe Basin hides an impact crater created \"around 300 million years ago.\"  Its discovery by scientist Tonguç Uysal was revealed in October 2010. The crater's \"minimum diameter is 80 km\", making it one of the largest of Australia's 30 to 50 known or suspected craters.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBowen Basin\nEast Warburton Basin\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "1896–97 Small Heath F.C. season",
    "content": "The 1896–97 season was the 16th season of competitive association football and 5th season in the Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. In 1895–96, Small Heath finished in 15th position in the 16-team First Division and were relegated via the test match system. In 1896–97, they finished 4th in the Second Division.\nSmall Heath entered the 1896–97 FA Cup at the first round (round of 32) and lost in that round for the fifth consecutive year, this time to Notts County. In local competitions, they were eliminated in the semi-final of the Birmingham Senior Cup and the first round of the Staffordshire Senior Cup, on each occasion beaten by Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nTwenty-three different players represented the club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were 12 different goalscorers. Alex Leake appeared in every match, and the top scorer was Jimmy Inglis with 16 goals. The highest attendance was around 7,500, significantly down on the previous season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Nottinghamshire Guardian suggested Small Heath would \"have to greatly improve their present team if they are to make a very prominent display even in [the second] division next season.\" Billy Ollis, last season's captain, moved on to Hereford Thistle of the Birmingham & District League, Jack Oliver returned to non-League football in his native north-east, Harry Haynes joined Southern League club Southampton St Mary's, Ted Devey left for Burton Wanderers, and Adam Fraser returned to Scotland, but the major loss was that of Fred Wheldon. Wheldon scored 116 goals from 175 matches in league and FA Cup for Small Heath, and the only match he missed in six seasons was when his sister died on the morning of the game. He joined League champions Aston Villa for a fee which, after much speculation, was confirmed at Small Heath's Annual General Meeting as £350 guaranteed, plus the proceeds of a match to be played between the two clubs. The £350 fee was reported to be a transfer record.\n\n\n== Review ==\n\n\n=== September–October ===\nSmall Heath prepared for the new season with a friendly match at Aston Villa in connection with Fred Wheldon's transfer. Wheldon scored twice as Villa won 3–1, Small Heath's goal coming from Walter Abbott. Because the kickoff was delayed until six o'clock, the match ended in near darkness. The League season began with a spirited performance at home to Newcastle United on a rain-soaked pitch. First-half goals from Alex Leake, Jimmy Inglis with a header from Tom Farnall's free kick, and Jack Jones gave Small Heath a 3–1 victory, prompting the press to predict a finish in the test match positions. In the return fixture, Newcastle led 3–2 at half time – three goals for Richard Smellie against Jones's two – but were reduced to ten men, William Graham having broken his arm. Inglis tied the scores in the second half but the home team scored a late winner. Two days later, Small Heath enjoyed a comfortable home win against Darwen in an early-evening match. Inglis opened the scoring with a header, then in the second half, a disputed goal was allowed, and a fine shot from Billy Walton and two goals from William Robertson made the final score 5–1.\nIn a poor game, Small Heath suffered an unexpected defeat at home to Lincoln City. The Leicester Chronicle suggested that \"if the Heathens have any pretentions towards regaining their position in the First Division, as we believe is their ambition, they will have to show form vastly different from last Saturday.\" An Inglis header gave his team a first-half lead on a slippery surface at Burton Swifts, and both sides wasted chances before Swifts equalised with ten minutes left.\nA 2–1 defeat at home to Burton Swifts preceded a visit to league leaders Newton Heath and reunion with former captain Caesar Jenkyns. The home side had the better of the first half, in torrential rain following a thunderstorm just before kickoff, but the closest they came to scoring was when Smith hit the bar. In the second half, Newton Heath scored from a scrimmage, but Jones equalised for Small Heath after the forwards rushed downfield. Playing with the benefit of the slope, Walsall took the lead twice in the Staffordshire Cup, but on change of ends, Small Heath equalised, and scored twice more in extra time to progress to the next round.\n\nIn mid-October, former England international forward Dennis Hodgetts joined from Aston Villa. The Dundee Courier & Argus assessed the player thus:Aston Villa have so many clever forwards that they afford to dispense with a man like Hodgetts, who is now naturally slow, and disinclined to work. But his judgment and coaching powers should render him a useful recruit for the other Birmingham club ... Hodgetts is the one historic forward England has produced. As an inside left it is doubtful if he ever had an equal; certainly he never had a superior. He was one of the most artistic dribblers and dodgers ever seen, ",

    "title": "Hunger (2023 film)",
    "content": "Hunger is a 2023 Thai psychological drama film directed by Sitisiri Mongkolsiri and written by Kongdej Jaturanrasamee. It stars Chutimon Chuengcharoensukying as Aoy, a street-food cook who is invited to join the fine-dining industry under the tutelage of the infamous Chef Paul, played by Nopachai Jayanama, with Gunn Svasti as Tone, a supportive sous chef. The film was announced by Netflix in 2022 as one of its six upcoming Thai original productions, and was released on the platform in April 2023. The film received mostly positive reviews.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAoy is the main cook at her family's street restaurant. She is scouted by Tone, the junior sous-chef of Hunger, an haute cuisine catering restaurant run by the celebrity Chef Paul. Dissatisfied with the direction of her life since finishing high school, Aoy accepts the invitation and auditions alongside a culinary school graduate. Paul has the applicants cook fried rice, and hires Aoy for her deeper understanding of culinary technique and her skill with the wok.\nIn preparation for a private birthday party hosted by a retired general, Paul demands that Aoy slice and fry wagyu beef to exacting specifications. After many failed attempts, she walks out in frustration but returns and practices frying the meat all night until Paul finally approves. At the party, Aoy fries the meat in front of the guests, who include entrepreneur Tos, a business rival of Paul. As Aoy continues working with the relentless Paul, she faces the limits of her skills and studies more cooking techniques from Tone.\nHunger's soup specialist Tue is fired for stealing ingredients, forcing sous-chef Dang to pick up the slack for Hunger's next client, a family of three. When Paul tries the soup, he tosses it out and remakes it using cheap ingredients on hand, later explaining that he tasted shrimp in the original soup even though he warned his chefs that the client's young daughter had a shellfish allergy. Paul deduces Dang sabotaged the soup due to his jealousy over Hunger's younger chefs surpassing him. Dang stabs Paul with a knife and storms out. Aoy visits the hospitalized Paul, who opens up about the reason he became a chef. His mother was a maid for an extravagantly rich family, and she was forced to make restitution when he broke a jar of caviar. The incident made Paul realize that the rich view food as a status symbol and take flavor and nourishment for granted, and he resolved to become a chef of such renown that rich people would debase themselves to have him cook for them. Aoy is distraught by her father suffering a health crisis, as well as learning that Hunger's previous client was a construction executive heavily in debt who killed his wife, daughter, and himself after they ate their meal.\nAfter Paul leads Hunger to serve a government official in an illegal hunt and cooking of a protected great hornbill from a national park, Aoy and Tone quit. Aoy is hired as the head chef at Tos's new restaurant Flame and grows famous, while Tone's restaurant struggles. A celebrity named Milky hires both Aoy and Paul to cook for her birthday party, which turns into an impromptu competition as the two chefs vie for the guests' adulation. In the end, Paul wins by serving an ordinary soup, and he explains to Aoy that he won not because his food or presentation were superior to hers, but because his reputation made the guests desire anything served by him more. Paul's gloating is interrupted when Tone leaks a video of Paul cooking the hornbill and the chef is arrested. Tos admits that he and Tone conspired to use the party to destroy Paul and elevate Aoy; furthermore, the celebrity client picked Paul for her party first and only hired Aoy because of Tos's lobbying. Disillusioned, Aoy quits Flame. She is welcomed home by her family and resumes cooking at their restaurant.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nNopachai Chaiyanam as Chef Paul\nChimwemwe Miller as Paul (voice)\nChutimon Chuengcharoensukying as Aoy\nGunn Svasti Na Ayudhya as Tone\nAlex Gravenstein as Tone (voice)\nMajid Sajadi as Food Taster\nBhumibhat Thavornsiri as Au\nKenneth Won as Party Guest\nVarit Leesavan as Tos\nLalita Paisarn as Milky\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews, with an 86% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The Bangkok Post's reviewer \nTatat Bunnag criticized the screenplay and dialogue, but concluded that \"despite all the flaws, Hunger is still worth watching, especially for those who love intense drama and exotic settings.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHunger at IMDb",

    "title": "Barbara Clayton",
    "content": "Dame Barbara Evelyn Clayton (2 September 1922 – 11 January 2011) was an English pathologist who made a significant contribution to clinical medicine, medical research and public service. She delivered what was depending on your point of view either a flawed verdict or deliberate cover-up that nothing but hysteria was to blame for the Camelford Water Pollution Incident (captured in the BBC documentary \"Poison Water\"). Dame Barbara was latterly Professor of Clinical Pathology at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nClayton was born in Liverpool on 2 September 1922 to Constance Evelyn (née Caine) and William Clayton, a food scientist who is credited with inventing salad cream. She was educated at St Nicholas Preparatory School in Orpington and Bromley County School for Girls, where she was head girl. She went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, qualifying in 1946. Her interest in research took her to the Medical Research Council clinical endocrinology unit in Edinburgh. In 1949 she received a PhD for her research into oestrogens in 1949.\nLater that year she moved to London to become the Holden research fellow at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, a position she held until 1956 when she became a chemical pathology lecturer at the School. Her research on hormones and the development of new biochemical techniques brought her recognition.\nIn 1959, she moved to Great Ormond Street Hospital to become a consultant pathologist. There she researched genetic metabolic disorders suffered by newborn babies. She developed a new, less invasive test to diagnose phenylketonuria – the test and the special diet that Claydon also designed continue to be in common use today. She worked with dieticians to optimize diets for infants with phenylketonuria and other metabolic disorders.\nOver her career, Clayton published more than 200 academic papers. Concerned with the high levels of lead found in children's blood she co-authored, with five others, the article 'Lead poisoning in children' (Arch dis child 1964, 39, 1–13) and while a member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in the 1980s, campaigned and lobbied the UK government to enforce a ban on lead in petrol, paint and other products. Her work showed a relationship between lead poisoning and intellectual impairment.\nIn 1978 she became the University of Southampton's first female professor when she took up the position of Professor of Chemical Pathology and Human Metabolism. She was Dean of Medicine at the university from 1983 to 1986, and honorary consultant chemical pathologist at the Southampton General Hospital. In 1987 she was appointed Honorary Research Professor in Metabolism and researched the nutritional needs of the elderly, particularly those in care homes.\nShe served on the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution from 1981 to 1996 and chaired the enquiry into the Camelford water pollution incident in 1988. She concluded that the symptoms locals experienced after the Camelford incident were caused by anxiety due to media coverage. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe met chemist William Klyne in 1947 while they were both employed at the Medical Research Council in Edinburgh. They married in 1949, and remained married until William Klyne's death in 1977. Together they had two children.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1999: Received the Gold Medal of the British Medical Association.\n1988: Named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1988 for her contributions to science.\n1983: Named Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n\n== Significant positions held ==\n1999–2007 Honorary President of the British Nutrition Foundation\n1988–1998 Chair of the Department of Health's Standing Committee on Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education.\n1995–1997 President of the National Society for Clean Air and Environmental Pollution.\n1993–1996 Led the Nutrition Task Force for the Health of the Nation, on behalf of the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.\n1984–1987 President of the Royal College of Pathologists.\n1981–1982 President of the Biomedical Science Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n1981–1982 President of the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism.\n1977–1978 President of the Association of Clinical Biochemists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoyal College of Pathologists website\nProfile at University of Southampton website",

Réunion was still a French colony and the abolition of slavery had occurred less than a century before.\nBrought up as one of nine children under the watchful eye of his school teacher father and stay-at-home mother, Manglou enjoyed much freedom exploring the banks of the Saint-Jean river, often going barefoot and shirtless.\nFrom the end of 1960 to 1975, Manglou successively held the position of Director of Social & Cultural Institutions in Sainte-Suzanne, Soisy-sous-Montmorency and Boulogne-Billancourt.\nIn 1971 he devoted a year of advanced study at the French National Institute of Popular Education at Marly-le-Roi to the study of the development of inter-disciplinary scholarship in rural areas. Manglou's study culminated \"Animation and Development,\" a dissertation that was written in collaboration with Jean Schüler and is considered authoritative in the field.\nIn 1974–1975, as Director of the Youth Center of Boulogne-Billancourt, Manglou began to coordinate various volunteer organizations in a city of 120,000. The exhibition \"Associations in the City\", unique for its time, received 10,000 visitors.\nDuring this same period Manglou also obtained a maîtrise in Human Sciences at the University of Paris, Val-de-Marne – a foreshadowing of experienced-based learning, which was later formalized in France as Validation des Acquis de l'Experience.\nThese various sociological approaches and a thirst for getting to know people and their cultures naturally led Yves Manglou to make his native island the focus of his literary journey.\nManglou is currently Series Editor at Éditions Orphie.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOrphie Editions\nGrand-mère Kalle\nNoir mais Marron (Black but Brown, in reference to the name wearing by the free slaves)\nKaloubadia Madam Debassayns (in Créole Réunionnais)\nBlack Phaeton Editions\nLe mystère du Piton de La Fournaise (The Fournaise mystery)\nZépingue le Petit Tangue (in collaboration with Josette Manglou and Yves Llopiz)\nLa naissance de Ticlou (in collaboration with Josette Manglou and Yves Llopiz)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThese are French articles related to Yves Manglou:\n\nYves Manglou, « La tendance à tourner le dos à la mer s’inverse », Le JIR, 2 December 2007.\n« Yves Manglou, romancier et aventurier de la mer », Le JIR, 6 August 2006.\n« La Famille Manglou, l'âme créole », L'Express, 5 April 2004.\n« Le quotidien de la mer : l'écrivain Yves Manglou », émission RFI, 17 April 2006.\n\n\n== External links ==\nSite de l'Association des Enseignants Documentalistes de l'Education Nationale de la Réunion.",

The glen is surrounded by large and rugged mountains characterised by huge boulders.  The Croe Water flows through the glen and into Loch Long.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGlen Croe is located to the north west of Loch Lomond and Loch Long, draining into the latter. At the head of the glen is the pass leading to Glen Kinglas. The A83 road runs the length of the glen, passing the viewpoint at Rest & Be Thankful, at the west of the Glen. Glen Croe is situated entirely within the Argyll Forest Park in Cowal. The glen is also within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.\nThe mountains on either side are:\n\nBeinn Ìme (Munro) at 1,011 metres (3,317 ft)\nBen Donich (Corbett) at 847 metres (2,779 ft)\nBeinn Luibhean (Corbett) at 857 metres (2,812 ft)\nThe Brack (Corbett) at 787 metres (2,582 ft)\nBeinn an Lochain (Corbett) at 703 metres (2,306 ft)\nThe Cobbler (Corbett) at 870 metres (2,850 ft)\n\n\n== Landslides ==\nThe glen was formed by glacial erosion and has repercussions today, as many areas are still unstable.\nThe A83 is prone to landslides, including the section within Glen Croe. The A83 is a main road to the west coast of Scotland. On 8 October 2023, ten people were airlifted off the road by helicopter, as they were trapped by seven separate landslides along a short section of the road.\nWhen the A83 is closed, traffic is diverted onto the single track military road that runs in the bottom of the glen, till the steep incline at the head of the glen called Rest & be Thankful.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe old road through the glen seen in the photograph (very top of article) is part of the military road that ran from Dumbarton to Inveraray. The old road was built in the 1740s under the supervision of Major William Caulfeild. A stone inscribed Rest & Be Thankful was erected around 1749, after this section of road was completed.  The rest and be thankful refers to a steep incline on the old military road, that precedes, entering the pass through too Glen Kinglas.\n\n\n== Rest and Be Thankful Speed Hill Climb ==\n\nFrom 1906 until 1970, motor racing events, including hill climbs and rally stages took place here.\n\n\n== Song ==\nGilleasbaig Mac an t-Saoir composed a song called \"Òran Ghlinne Chrò\", detailing the sadness he felt when the gamekeeper moved his flock out of the glen to make room for deer and sport hunting.

    "content": "In mathematics, a Clifford–Klein form is a double coset space\n\nΓ\\G/H,\nwhere G is a reductive Lie group, H a closed subgroup of G, and Γ a discrete subgroup of G that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space G/H.  A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given G and H. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether Γ\\G/H can be taken to be a compact space, called a compact Clifford–Klein form.\nWhen H is  itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Moritz Epple, the Clifford-Klein forms began when W. K. Clifford used quaternions to twist their space. \"Every twist possessed a space-filling family of invariant lines\", the Clifford parallels. They formed \"a particular structure embedded in elliptic 3-space\", the Clifford surface, which demonstrated that \"the same local geometry may be tied to spaces that are globally different\". Wilhelm Killing thought that for free mobility of rigid bodies there are four spaces: Euclidean, hyperbolic, elliptic and spherical. They are spaces of constant curvature but constant curvature differs from free mobility: it is local, the other is both local and global. Killing's contribution to Clifford-Klein space forms involved formulation in terms of groups, finding new classes of examples, and consideration of the scientific relevance of spaces of constant curvature. He took  up  the task to develop physical theories of CK space forms. Karl Schwarzchild wrote \"The admissible measure of the curvature of space\", and noted in an appendix that physical space may actually be a non-standard space of constant curvature.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKilling–Hopf theorem\nSpace form\n\n\n== References ==\nMoritz Epple (2003) From Quaternions to Cosmology: Spaces of Constant Curvature ca. 1873–1925, invited address to International Congress of Mathematicians\nKilling, W.

    "title": "Spur-winged goose",
    "content": "The spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) is a large, Sub-Saharan African waterbird in the family Anatidae, which includes geese and shelducks. However, P. gambensis developed unique environmental adaptations, which resulted in the evolution of several anatomical features that are not shared with other anatids; thus, the species has been classified one step further into its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAdults are 75–115 cm (30–45 in) long, and weigh an average of 4–6.8 kg (8.8–15.0 lb) (rarely up to 10 kg (22 lb)), with ganders (males) being noticeably larger than the geese. The wingspan can range from 150 to 200 cm (59 to 79 in). One source claims the average weight of males is around 6 kg (13 lb) and the weight of females is around 4.7 kg (10 lb). However, 11 individuals that were banded in South Africa, were found to average only 3.87 kg (8.5 lb), with a range of 2.4 to 5.4 kg (5.3 to 11.9 lb). Another South African-based study found 58 males weighing an average of 5.52 kg (12.2 lb) and measuring 98.1 cm (38.6 in) in total length; meanwhile, 34 females averaged 3.35 kg (7.4 lb) in weight and 84.2 cm (33.1 in) in total length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 42.5 to 55 cm (16.7 to 21.7 in), the bill is 5.7 to 6.4 cm (2.2 to 2.5 in) and the tarsus is 5.7 to 12 cm (2.2 to 4.7 in). They are among the largest true African waterfowl (besides the wading Goliath heron) and are, on average, the world's largest \"goose\", although in average weight, their size is at least rivaled by the Cape Barren goose. Spur-winged geese appear to be more closely allied to shelducks than \"true geese\" such as those from the Branta and Anser genera. They are mainly black, with a white face and large white wing patches. The long legs are pinkish red in colour. \n\nThe male differs from the female, not only in size, but also in having a larger red facial patch extending back from the red bill, and a knob at the base of the upper mandible. This is generally a quiet species. Typically, only males make a call, which consists of a soft bubbling cherwit when taking wing or alarmed. During breeding displays or in instances of alarm, both sexes may utter other inconspicuous calls.\n\n\n== Toxicity ==\n\nSome populations of the spur-winged goose are toxic. Populations that have a diet that includes significant quantities of blister beetles are poisonous. The poison, cantharidin, is held within the tissue of the bird resulting in poisoning of those that eat the cooked goose. A dose of 10 mg of cantharidin can kill a human.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nThis species often occurs in open grasslands with lakes, seasonal pools, rivers, swamps and river deltas. Large inland rivers and lakes are perhaps most commonly inhabited, with saline lakes and upland areas generally being avoided, although the species can occur to an elevation of 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in eastern Africa. It is also absent from arid zones.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe spur-winged goose is gregarious, generally meeting in small flocks that contain up to 50 birds. They occur around various African rivers, lakes and swamps. Varied sites may be used for post-breeding moulting, in which case large numbers of the geese may congregate. This common species feeds by grazing, but spends the middle part of the day resting by water. Its diet consists predominantly of plant matter such as the vegetative parts and seeds of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants, agricultural grains, fruit (e.g. figs)  and tuberous crops, although it may occasionally supplement its diet with small fish or insects. Dispersal may occur in pursuit of feeding opportunities outside of the breeding season.\nThe breeding season for spur-winged geese is variable across the range. In the north, breeding generally occurs from August to December, in eastern Africa from January to June and in southern Africa from August to May. This species is highly aggressive to other waterfowl (including conspecifics) during the breeding season. At this time of the year, the geese may violently put the spur on the bend of the wings to use in conflicts with other birds. Adult male geese are especially prone to attacking other adult males. The large nest is usually concealed in vegetation near water, but tree holes, cavities in rocks, old hamerkop, African fish eagle or social weaver nests and even the top of a termite mound and an aardvark burrow have been used as nests. When choosing a tree-nest site, they will generally select a nest located close to the ground at between 20 and 100 cm (7.9 and 39.4 in) high in trees 3 to 4 m (9.8 to 13.1 ft) high. Generally, they prefer quiet, undisturbed stretches of riverbank and wetlands for nest sites.\n\n\n== Status ==\nThe spur-winged goose is a common bird of African wetlands. Perhaps the main threat to the species is development and destruction of wetland habitats and unregulated hunting.

    "title": "Hazelwood School",
    "content": "Hazelwood School is a private preparatory school in Limpsfield, Surrey, England.\nThe school was established in 1890 as a boarding school for boys aged 8–13 by Ruth and Edward Baily. Baily bought the land from the Titsey Place estate as he loved the views of the Weald and the Ashdown Forest and thought the site healthy and bracing. The first cohort of 38 pupils was accommodated and taught in a purpose-built Victorian building that remains at the centre of the school today.\nIn 1962 the school was bought by Tim Dowling and merged with his Bickley Hall School in Bromley, Kent—resulting in the double motto and double badge known today. Hazelwood School became a registered charity and was incorporated as a limited company in 1968. Girls were first admitted to the school and a pre-prep department established in 1978. Boarding continued at the school until 1999.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1880–1906 ===\nEdward Baily founded Hazelwood School as an educational boarding establishment for boys in 1880.  The first site for the school was in Balsham, Cambridgeshire, with just two boys.  In 1884, with a dozen more boys, the school moved to Warlingham in Surrey before finally settling on our current site in Limpsfield, Surrey, in 1890 with 38 pupils.\nFollowing Mr Baily's retirement in 1906, Mr Lifton-Wynne, who had worked at the school many years, took over the management of the school.  This period in the school's history was overshadowed by war and, less seriously, recurring attacks of influenza. \nIn the post-war period, Mr Hugh Crauford Irving took over as headmaster.  He established the house system with two houses named after old boys who had served during the First World War: Cather and Hansen.\nThe fabric of the school's buildings remained much the same during this period, although regular improvements were made to the chapel.\n\n\n=== 1930s and 1940s ===\nMr Parry took over as headmaster in 1938, on the eve of the Second World War.  During the war, the site was bombed, which resulted in the loss of the original Victorian pavilion and fives courts.  These were rebuilt in the late 1940s along with the Oak and Chestnut cottages, which needed to house the growing number of boys and staff.\nChestnut was used as married quarters for staff and accommodation for senior boys.  Oak cottage housed three masters, matron and more dormitories for senior boys.  In 1949, a new changing room was also added to the site.  By the end of the 1940s, there were in the region of 70 boarders so another house was added to the house system: Blacker-Douglass, named after another old boy who served in the First World War.\n\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nThroughout the 1950s, there were 70 boys boarding at Hazelwood.  Despite the healthy numbers on roll, post-war austerity and rebuilding, necessitated by wartime bombing, meant that the school fell on hard times.\nIn 1962, Godfrey R V \"Tim\" Dowling (born 1917) bought the school and merged with his own school, Bickley Hall, Bromley.  The school mottoes also merged, resulting in the double badge emblem.\nThe school remained privately owned by Mr Dowling until 1968 when it became a registered charity and was incorporated as a limited company.  The newly formed board of trustees / governors bought the freehold from the Dowlings.  Mr Dowling remained as head until his retirement in 1974.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1972, Mr Dowling oversaw the completion of a series of new buildings to the site.  A multi-purpose hall replaced the 1940s cricket pavilion and fives court.  This was used as a gymnasium, dining hall, music room and kitchen space, with three classrooms, library and staff room upstairs.  More classrooms were built in front and to the side of the main Victorian building.\nIn the late 1970s, new headmaster Mr Bawtree had Chestnut cottage adapted for use as a pre-preparatory school for children aged 5–7 years.  Oak cottage continued to be used staff accommodation and all boarders were moved to the main Victorian building.  In 1979, two lower tennis courts were added.\nWith a new pre-prep and the admittance of girls, the number of pupils on roll rose considerably during this period.  A new house system was established in 1976: the four houses were named after past Hazelwood headmasters: Baily, Irving, Parry and Dowling.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nMr Bawtree continued his development of the site into the 1980s with a new indoor swimming pool to replace the outdoor swimming bath in front of Oak cottage.  He also added a new Creative Arts Centre.  In 1987, a violent storm caused the lavish Victorian chapel to be destroyed so plans were put in place for its replacement. \n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1990, the new chapel was opened.  The new chapel formed part of a performing arts block, which housed the music department and a theatre.\nMr Bawtree retired in 1995 and was succeeded by Mr Synge. \nIn 1996, Mr Synge opened the new purpose-built Chestnut building to house the increasing number of pre-prep children attending the school.  This gave them thei",

    "content": "Visa requirements for Angolan citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Angola. As of 2025, Angolan citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 47 countries and territories, ranking the Angolan passport 91st in terms of travel freedom (tied with passports from Jordan, Mauritania and Mali) according to the Henley Passport Index.\n\n\n== Visa requirements map ==\n\n\n== Visa requirements ==\n\n\n== Dependent, Disputed, or Restricted territories ==\nUnrecognized or partially recognized countries\n\nDependent and autonomous territories\n\n\n== Non-visa restrictions ==\n\nMany countries have entry restrictions on foreigners that go beyond the common requirement of having either a valid visa or a visa exemption. Such restrictions may be health related or impose additional documentation requirements on certain classes of people for diplomatic or political purposes.\n\n\n=== Blank passport pages ===\nMany countries require a minimum number of blank pages to be available in the passport being presented, typically one or two pages. Endorsement pages, which often appear after the visa pages, are not counted as being valid or available.\n\n\n=== Vaccination ===\n\nThe African countries of Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia, require all incoming passengers older than nine months to one year to have a current International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, as does the South American territory of French Guiana.\nSome other countries require vaccination only if the passenger is coming from an infected area or has visited one recently or has transited for 12 hours in those countries: Algeria, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n=== Passport validity length ===\nVery few countries, such as Paraguay, just require a valid passport on arrival.\nHowever many countries and groupings now require only an identity card – especially from their neighbours. Other countries may have special bilateral arrangements that depart from the generality of their passport validity length policies to shorten the period of passport validity required for each other's citizens or even accept passports that have already expired (but not been cancelled).\nSome countries, such as Japan, Ireland and the United Kingdom, require a passport valid throughout the period of the intended stay.\nIn the absence of specific bilateral agreements, countries requiring passports to be valid for at least 6 more months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Anguilla, Bahrain, Bhutan, Botswana, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Curaçao, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, and Vietnam.\nCountries requiring passports valid for at least 4 months on arrival include Micronesia and Zambia.\nCountries requiring passports with a validity of at least 3 months beyond the date of intended departure include Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Honduras, Montenegro, Nauru, Moldova and New Zealand.\nSimilarly, the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, all European Union countries (except Ireland) together with Switzerland also require 3 months validity beyond the date of the bearer's intended departure unless the bearer is an EEA or Swiss national.\nCountries requiring passports valid for at least 3 months on arrival include Albania, North Macedonia, Panama, and Senegal.\nBermuda requires passports to be valid for at least 45 days upon entry.\nCountries that require a passport validity of at least one month beyond the date of intended departure include Eritrea, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macau, the Maldives and South Africa.\n\n\n==== Maximum passport age ====\nCountries of the Schengen area require non-EU passports to be less than 10 years old upon entry.\n\n\n=== Criminal record ===\nSome countries, including Australia, Canada, Fiji, New Zealand and the United States, routinel",

    "content": "12696 Camus, provisional designation 1989 SF1, is a carbonaceous background asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 9 kilometers in diameter.\nIt was discovered on 26 September 1989, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile, and named after French Nobel Prize laureate in literature Albert Camus.\n\n\n== Classification and orbit ==\nCamus is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,551 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery, as no precoveries were taken and no identifications were made before 1989.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThis minor planet was named after French philosopher, author, and journalist, Albert Camus (1913–1960), who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957.\nCamus is best known for his novels L'Etranger (The Stranger) and La Peste (The Plague). His main interests were justice, ethics, and politics. As a liberal humanist, he was against the doctrines of Christianity as well as Marxism. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 March 2000 (M.P.C. 39658).\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nCamus has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey.\n\n\n=== Lightcurves ===\nIn October 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Camus was obtained from photometric observations by Julian Oey at the Leura Observatory (E17) in Australia. The lightcurve rendered a rotation period of 3.78±0.04 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.40 in magnitude (U=3-).\n\n\n=== Diameter and albedo ===\nAccording to NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Camus has an albedo of 0.07 and 0.13 with a corresponding diameter of 9.3 and 7.7 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a larger diameter of 11.1 kilometer with an absolute magnitude of 13.5.\n\n\n== References ==\n \n\n\n== External links ==\nAsteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info Archived 16 December 2017 at the Wayback Machine)\nDictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\nAsteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR – Observatoire de Genève, Raoul Behrend\nDiscovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (10001)-(15000) – Minor Planet Center\n12696 Camus at AstDyS-2, Asteroids—Dynamic Site\nEphemeris · Observation prediction · Orbital info · Proper elements · Observational info\n12696 Camus at the JPL Small-Body Database",

In 1878 it was rented out to the Baltic German journalist de:Konstantin Paul Gerhard von Kügelgen (1843–1904), who combined it with the Nordische Presse (Northern Press). The newspaper then became the leading informational newspaper (de:Intelligenzblatt) of the Baltic region.

He also played for the Brazil national team in the 1980s, including at the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nLeandro spent his entire club career Flamengo, where he won four Brazilian national leagues, five Rio State championships, one Libertadores da América, and one Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool. In total, he played 417 matches and scored 14 goals for Flamengo.\n\n\n== International career ==\nLeandro was capped 27 times for Brazil between September 1981 and May 1986, scoring two goals. He took part at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was part of a star-studded Brazilian team, along with Zico, Júnior, Falcão, Sócrates, and many others, including Éder and Toninho Cerezo. Despite the plethora of creative midfield talent in the team, and the exciting brand of attacking football that they displayed throughout the tournament, Brazil were eliminated in the second round, after placing second in the so-called \"Group of Death\" with rivals and defending champions Argentina, as well as the eventual champions Italy.\nLeandro also took part at the 1983 Copa América, where Brazil finished in second place.

In this role, he was capable of delivering decisive crosses to the forwards, or indeed taking a shot at goal himself. He also had an ability to dribble past opposing players and get forward. Leandro was also able to cover the flank both offensively and defensively: he could often be found in the outside right position, yet would get back to defence when needed.\nAfter several knee injuries and some surgeries in 1985, Leandro started to play as a centre-back, also achieving much success in this role, and was still called up to the Brazil national squad to play in this new position.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nFlamengo\nCampeonato Carioca: 1978, 1979, 1979, 1981, 1986\nCampeonato Brasileiro Série A: 1980, 1982, 1983\nCopa União: 1987\nIntercontinental Cup: 1981\nCopa Libertadores: 1981\nCopa do Brasil: 1990\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nBola de Prata: 1982, 1985\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLeandro at National-Football-Teams.com",

    "content": "Frederick Joseph Ross (May 12, 1927 – August 19, 2014)  LL. D. was a New Brunswick based Canadian artist best known for his figurative drawings, paintings and murals.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRoss was born in on May 12, 1927 in Saint John, New Brunswick, to parents Ernest L. Ross and Elizabeth Drake. He studied art at the Saint John Vocational School. Ross received a bachelor of fine arts from Mount Allison University and a bachelor of education from the University of New Brunswick. Ross went on to create a number of notable murals in the Maritimes, including one in Fredericton and on Prince Edward Island . He returned to teach at Saint John Vocational School from the 1950s until 1970, becoming the head of its art department. He married Sheila Urquhart in 1954.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1946, Ross began work on a commissioned mural work that would become The Destruction of War & Rebuilding the World through Education, a memorial mural to 63 students of Fredericton High School who had died in World War II. After its unveiling in 1948, the mural was later dismantled and lost in the 1950s. It was recreated by Ross and several apprentices in 2011, in a plan developed by the artist William Forrestall and based on the original 1948 full scale cartoons (preparatory drawings) Ross had mistakenly left at the New Brunswick Museum.  The chance discovery of the full-scale mural drawings, now housed at the National Gallery of Canada, provided what would eventually become a treasure map-like route to the mural's restoration. With what grew to be nationwide support, three studio assistants, who were guided by Fred Ross and the drawings that he had created more than 60 years earlier, retraced the developmental process of the mural in what would prove to be the most ambitious reanimation of a cultural treasure in Canadian art history. This unprecedented story of the mural's history — its creation, loss, and eventual restoration and return to public prominence is documented in the text \"Redeemed: Restoring the Lost Fred Ross Mural\", written and edited by William Forrestall, and published by the University of New Brunswick.\nIn 1967, Ross' work was shown at Expo 67 in Montreal. The Beaverbrook Art Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of his work titled The Art of Fred Ross - A Timeless Humanism curated by Tom Smart in 1993.  Ross' work is held in the National Gallery of Canada, the New Brunswick Museum, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and other collections.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nRoss received the Order of Canada in 2004. He was awarded with an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of New Brunswick in 1984 and the Order of New Brunswick in 2008.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is the only daughter of G. Venu, a Koodiyattam artist and director of the Irinjalakuda Natana Kairali, and Nirmala Paniker, an artist and researcher of Mohiniyattam. Kapila spent her childhood at two places: the Lawrence School, Lovedale, where her mother taught, and the 'Natana Kairali', founded by her father in Irinjalakuda, Thrissur district, for the promotion of ancient Kerala arts.\nAt Irinjalakuda, at the age of seven, Kapila started learning basics of Koodiyattam under Usha Nangiar, and then detailed training under Ammannur Madhava Chakyar, for nearly 10 years in the gurukula tradition. Later, her father Venu G and mother Nirmala Panicker became her gurus. It was her father's advice, supervision and discipline that helped her refine the skills she had learned under Ammannur and make her a performer. At the art school founded by her father, Natana Kairali, she trained under gurus like Kavungal Chathunni Panicker, Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair, and Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair. She studied Mohiniyattam under her mother Nirmala Panicker. Kalaripayattu was taught by Balan Gurukkal. She also studied under Japanese dancer Min Tanaka for six years.

The son of a stonemason, he served an apprenticeship to a tailor in Basseterre before deciding to emigrate to the United States. Settling in New York City, he became a leader of the West Indian community there, and organised financial support for the newly formed Saint Kitts Workers' League (a forerunner of the current Labour Party). After more than 25 years as a resident of the United States, Allen returned to Saint Kitts in 1935, becoming known as an editor of various labour movement publications.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nAllen was appointed to the Legislative Council of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla in 1958, but resigned in 1962 to allow Robert Bradshaw, a minister in the West Indies Federation, to resume his position after the federation's dissolution. He returned to the council shortly after, and served for a period as a minister without portfolio before eventually being elected speaker.

    "title": "Girls at War",
    "content": "\"Girls at War\" is a 1972 short story by Chinua Achebe. The narrative focuses on the essence of survival amidst the uncertainties of war. Through the protagonist, Reginald Nwankwo, the story unfolds the intricacies of determination, resilience, and the human spirit's quest for survival. Encountering a young woman Gladys, three times in different circumstances, Reginald's journey becomes a metaphor for life's unpredictable paths. In their initial encounter, he offers advice to Gladys, advocating for education and discouraging involvement in the militia, foreseeing the dangers it holds for women.\nHowever, fate brings them together again at a militia checkpoint where Reginald discovers Gladys has joined the militia. Despite his initial reservations, he admires her determination to survive and thrive in the midst of adversity. Her transformation from a young girl to a confident woman highlights the resilience bred by necessity during wartime. As the war continues to ravage their lives, Reginald's hostility towards it grows, fueled by the disruption it brings to his daily life. Through his experiences and encounters with Gladys, \"Girls at War\" poignantly illustrates the enduring human spirit's ability to adapt, endure, and find moments of beauty amidst the chaos of conflict.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe story follows Reginald Nwankwo, a man living in a turbulent time of war. The first encounter with Gladys, a militia girl, at a checkpoint leaves a lasting impression on him, challenging his perspective on the revolution. Over time, as the war progresses and conditions worsen, Reginald's encounters with Gladys become more significant.\nTheir paths cross again, and Reginald offers Gladys a lift, revealing her transformation from a devoted militia girl to a kept woman. Despite his initial judgment, Reginald feels a sense of duty towards Gladys and offers her support. At a party hosted by a Lieutenant-Colonel, tensions rise when a drunken guest speaks harsh truths about the war. Reginald witnesses the event and reflects on the moral decay of society. He resolves to help Gladys and seeks to uncover the influence behind her transformation.\nAs Reginald prepares to take Gladys home, their departure is delayed, and their car breaks down. Amidst the chaos, they encounter a disabled soldier seeking help. Tragedy strikes as they are caught in an air raid, resulting in devastating consequences.\nThe story explores themes of societal collapse, moral ambiguity, and the human cost of war, as characters navigate through a world filled with hardship and uncertainty.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\"Compassion Amidst Chaos\" Reginald Nwankwo's journey through the tumultuous landscape of war reveals the profound impact of compassion in a world torn apart by violence. Through his evolving relationship with Gladys, a former militia girl turned kept woman, Reginald confronts his own prejudices and discovers the complexities of humanity in the face of moral decay. As they navigate through the wreckage of society, their encounters with tragedy and hardship illuminate the harsh realities of war and the sacrifices required to maintain one's integrity.

    "title": "Tirso de Molina",
    "content": "Gabriel Téllez, O. de M. (24 March 1583 – 20 February 1648), also known as Tirso de Molina, was a Spanish Baroque dramatist and poet, as well as a Mercedarian friar, and Catholic priest. He is primarily known for writing The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest, the play from which the character Don Juan originates. His work also includes female protagonists and the exploration of sexual issues.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nGabriel Téllez was born in Madrid to Andrés López and Juana Téllez, servants of the Count of Molina. As a youth, he studied at the University of Alcalá. He joined the mendicant Order of Our Lady of Mercy on 4 November 1600, by whom he was sent to the Monastery of San Antolín at Guadalajara to begin his period of novitiate on 21 January 1601. He had been ordained as a priest by 1610.\nTéllez had been writing plays for ten years when he was sent by his superiors on a mission to the West Indies in 1615; as a result, he resided in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo from 1616 to 1618. After returning to Europe, he resided at the Mercedarian monastery in Madrid, where he took part in the proceedings of the Medrano Academy, competed in the literary tournaments, and wrote for the stage.\nTellez' first publication, the incomplete Cigarrales de Toledo (a work licensed in 1621, but not published until 1624), is a miscellany of short tales, novellas, verses, and three plays. One of the novellas, Los tres maridos burlados, which may have been derived from Francesco Cieco da Ferrara's Mambriano, and the play entitled El vergonzoso en palacio are considered to demonstrate wit and ingenuity. The preface to Cigarrales de Toledo states that Tirso de Molina had already written three hundred plays.\nTéllez opposed culteranismo in the Cigarrales de Toledo, and made enemies through his attacks on it in pieces such as Amar por arte mayor and La celosa de si misma. The tone of some of his productions caused his rivals to denounce him as a corrupter of public morals to the Council of Castile in 1625, and, though no legal action was taken against him, he may have been reprimanded privately. In 1626, it was thought to be advisable to transfer him to Salamanca, thus Téllez left Madrid, determined not to write anything more for the stage. Although one of his plays, La huerta de San Juan, is dated as being written in 1626, there is no proof that he started writing it after his departure from Madrid, and it is suspected that he did not write anything for eight years.\nTéllez, however, had not lost his interest in theatre, having published twelve representative pieces as the first part of his dramatic works (1626). At the same time, he continued to serve his Order, being named the prior of the monastery at Trujillo in 1626; he was elected later to the posts of reader in theology and Definitor General, and, in May 1632, he was appointed the official archivist of the Order.\nHis Deleitar aprovechando, which was published in 1635, is a counterpart of the Cigarrales de Toledo. A sequel was promised to this collection of tales, lyrics, and autos, but, as in the case of the Cigarrales de Toledo, the continuation never appeared.\nTwelve plays constitute the third part of his dramatic works published in 1634; the plays were supposedly edited by the writer's nephew, Francisco Lucas de Ávila; however, Ávila may have been a cover identity for himself. The second section of the plays (1635), the printing of which was paid for by the Confraternity of St. Jerome, contains four plays by Téllez, and eight written by him in collaboration with other dramatists, including Juan Ruiz de Alarcón; however, Tirso de Molina still did the majority of the writing. The fourth and fifth compilations of his dramatic works (1635 and 1636) each contain twelve plays; the haste with which these five volumes were issued may indicate the author's desire to save some part of his work from destruction, and the appearance of his nephew's name on the titlepages of the last four volumes may indicate his desire to avoid conflict with the authorities. A sixth volume of dramatic pieces, consisting of comedies, was announced; however, the project was abandoned.\nDramatic composition may have still been a part of Tirso's leisure as he grew older, as indicated by how the fragmentary autograph copy of Las quinas de Portugal is dated 8 March 1638, despite the fact that his active career as a dramatist ended two years earlier. He was absorbed by other duties. As official archivist of his order, he compiled the elaborate Historia de la Merced (his religious order), which occupied him until 24 December 1639, and which was not published until 1973. As a tribute to the Count de Sastago, who had accepted the dedication of the fourth part of the plays, and who may have helped to defray the publishing expenses, Tirso de Molina is said to have compiled the Genealogía de la casa de Sastago (1640), but the ascription of this genealogical work is disputed.\nOn 29 September 1645, Tirso d",

He grew up on a farm until 1881, when he returned to Brooklyn. When he was 14, he went to work in a business trade. When he was 18, he went to Mount Hermon School near Northfield, Massachusetts. He then went to Wesleyan Academy. In 1892, he was admitted to the Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He graduated from there in 1897. He then went to New York University Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1899. He then practiced law in Brooklyn, initially as a member of the firm DeGroot, Kenyon & Hubbard, and then independently.\nIn 1903, De Groot was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing the Queens County 2nd District. He served in the Assembly in 1904, 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1909.\nIn 1923, De Groot was appointed Assistant United States Attorney. Of the more than 1,000 cases he tried in the Circuit Court of Appeals, he didn't lose a single one. In light of his success, in 1925 President Coolidge appointed him the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. A series of failures occurred under De Groot as well as fights with the Justice Department, culminating with Attorneys General John G. Sargent and William D. Mitchell both requesting De Groot's resignation in 1929. Newly-elected President Hoover proceeded to oust De Groot, who returned to a private law practice afterwards.\nDe Groot was a founder of the Richmond Hill Record and the Temple Forum. He was a member of the Freemasons, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and the New York State Bar Association. He was a Methodist, serving as a local preacher and chairman of the board of trustees for Mt.

    "content": "Ntlhoi Motsamai (born 1963) is a Lesotho politician who served as the first female Speaker of the National Assembly from 1999 to 2012. She was elected again from March 2015 to June 2017. Motsamai worked as a teacher before entering politics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMotsamai was born in the remote village of Ha Pafoli, in the Mohale's Hoek District. She attended Eagle's Peak High School and then went on to study at the National University of Lesotho, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Education (B.Sc.Ed.) degree and majoring in biology and chemistry. After her graduation, Motsamai began teaching at St. John's High School in Mafeteng. She later returned to the National University to complete a Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree, simultaneously working in the office of the dean.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== 1996–2012 ===\nMotsamai entered politics in 1996, when she was elected deputy speaker of the National Assembly. Lesotho's constitution does not restrict the speakership or the deputy speakership to members of parliament, only requiring that ministers cannot be elected to those positions. Motsamai succeeded to the speakership in 1999, following the death of John Teboho Kolane. She became Lesotho's first female speaker, and was also believed to be the youngest speaker in Africa. When she took office, the National Assembly had only three female MPs.\nIn 2005, Motsamai nominated Bereng Sekhonyana to represent Lesotho at a SADC parliamentary reform conference in Botswana. Justin Lekhanya (the leader of the Basotho National Party) objected to her decision, and subsequently organised a series of protests at the National Assembly buildings. The assembly's privileges committee subsequently found that Lekhanya and four other BNP members had threatened and intimidated Motsamai, and recommended that they be suspended from parliament without pay for up to five months. Sekhonyana was assassinated two days after that finding was handed down.\n\n\n=== 2012–present ===\nIn February 2012, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili left the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) party to form a new party, the Democratic Congress. He was joined by 44 other members of parliament. When parliament returned, Motsamai (who had joined the new party) asked MPs to stand in the seats to show their support for Mosisili's government, and subsequently ruled that he still had control of the assembly and could thus remain in power. Her ruling was controversial, as Lesotho's electoral law prevents members elected on a party list from switching parties mid-term. Thabang Kholumo, the deputy leader of the Popular Front for Democracy, said that Motsamai's ruling was unconstitutional, as she had usurped King Letsie III's power to nominate the prime minister, while Tom Thabane, the leader of the All Basotho Convention, called for Motsamai and Mosisili to be arrested for treason.\nMosisili's government was defeated at the 2012 general election, and Motsamai was replaced as speaker by Sephiri Motanyane. She was re-elected to the speakership in March 2015, following the 2015 general election, when the Democratic Congress returned to power at the head of a coalition government. She won the speakership election 66–53, in a vote along party lines.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Lesotho political crisis\nList of female speakers of national and territorial lower houses\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

In order to qualify for the temporary cessation, certain operations (as defined in the lease or by case law) must be commenced on the leased premises or lands pooled or unitized therewith within a specified time period (typically from 30 to 120 days).\n\n\n=== For example ===\n\"Notwithstanding the provisions of this lease to the contrary, this lease shall terminate at the end of the primary term or any extension thereof as to all of the leased land except those lands within any Governmental Section in which is located a well producing or capable of producing oil and/or gas or on which lessee is engaged in drilling or reworking operations. This lease shall not terminate so long as drilling or reworking operations are being continuously prosecuted if not more than 180 days shall lapse between the completion or abandonment of one well and the beginning of operations for the drilling of another well.\"\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe continuous drilling provision was created in order to provide more certainty in the face of inconsistent court rulings. While a continuous drilling provision may provide the parties with a more reliable test to determine whether drilling and operations have been continuously prosecuted (so as to hold a lease past its primary term), the inclusion of the provision could prove fatal to a lease that is held by production.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada ran a full slate of 295 candidates in the 1988 federal election, and won 169 seats for a second consecutive majority governments.  Many of the party's candidates have their own biography pages; information about others may be found here.\n\n\n== Ontario ==\n\n\n=== Richard Berthiaume (Nickel Belt) ===\nRichard Berthiaume described himself as a fuel oil dealer.  He supported official bilingualism, and described the anti-French Confederation of Regions Party as having tapped into \"an undercurrent\" he had not realized existed.  He received 8,080 votes (20.75%), finishing third against New Democratic Party incumbent John Rodriguez.\n\n\n=== Bob Fera (Sudbury) ===\nBob Fera is a former educator, and at one time served as principal of the largest separate school in Sudbury.  He was an alderman and regional councillor before running for the House of Commons, and also served as Deputy Mayor in the mid-1980s.  He opposed Sudbury's move to market value assessment for property taxes in 1986, following significant rate increases throughout his ward.  He moved a successful motion against Sunday shopping two years later, and was quoted as saying \"this community is not ready to trade in its prayer cards for VISA cards\".\nMany believed that Fera was a New Democrat, and his decision to run for the Progressive Conservatives was greeted with surprise in some circles.  Fera argued that the PCs were likely to win the election, and that Sudbury would benefit from having a member on the government side.  He received 9,356 votes (21.99%), finishing third against Liberal candidate Diane Marleau.\nFera became chairman of the board of the Manitoulin-Sudbury Community Care Access Centre in 1996, and served as chair of the Ontario Association of Community Care Access Centres for a time.  He criticized the provincial government of Mike Harris for its approach to home care in 1998, but welcomed the government's infusion of new money to the industry the following year.  In November 1999, the Harris government appointed him to a provincial Round Table on Elder Abuse.  Two years later, however, Fera argued that renewed government cuts in his sector were jeopardizing the service.  His centre was forced to introduce severe cutbacks that same year, which Fera blamed on provincial underfunding.  FHe later indicated that he was prepared to introduce user fees to prevent further cuts.\nFera resigned his position in November 2001, in protest against the Harris government's efforts to restructure the province's Community Care Access Centres (the government had introduced legislation giving the province the right to appoint boards of directors and chief administrative officers).  The board rejected his resignation, and he stayed to lead a province-wide protest against the proposed legislation.  The legislation was nonetheless passed, and the Harris government dissolved the centre's board in February 2002.\nJust before the board's dissolution, Fera sharply criticized the Harris government for firing its executive director, Bob Knight.  Knight had previously criticized funding shortfalls, and Fera described his dismissal as \"a vendetta by the government to silence the opposition to the lack of funding in the home-care sector\".\n\n\n== References ==",

    "content": "The Stanley Royd Hospital, earlier named the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, was a mental health facility in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. It was managed by the Wakefield and Pontefract Community Health NHS Trust.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe facility, which was designed by Watson and Pritchett using a corridor plan layout, was opened as the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum in 1818. William Ellis, who had a reputation for employing the principles of humane treatment, was appointed the first superintendent of the asylum.\nJohn Davies Cleaton, who had previously held the post of Assistant Medical Officer at the Lancaster Asylum was appointed Medical Director before becoming a Commissioner in Lunacy in 1866.\nJames Crichton-Browne, who was appointed superintendent at the hospital in 1866, went on to carry out pioneering research on the neuropathology of insanity.\nAfter the facility joined the National Health Service in 1948, it became the Stanley Royd Hospital. In a serious incident at the hospital in August 1984, 355 patients and 106 members of staff were affected by salmonella food poisoning; the outbreak led to 19 patient deaths. After the introduction of Care in the Community, the hospital went into a period of decline and eventually closed in 1995. The hospital has since been converted for residential use and is now known as Parklands Manor.\n\n\n== Mental Health Museum ==\nThe Mental Health Museum (previously known as the Stephen Beaumont Museum of Mental Health), located at Fieldhead Hospital in Wakefield, contains artefacts from and exhibits on the history of the asylum.  Artefacts include restraining equipment, a padded cell, photographs, medical and surgical equipment, and documents.  There is also a scale model of Stanley Royd Hospital, which was the museum's original location until the hospital closed in 1995.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nIn 1852, plans of the Wakefield Asylum were plagiarised by Francesco Cianciolo who submitted them as his own in a design competition for an Asylum for the Insane in Malta. Cianciolo won the competition and the asylum was constructed between 1853 and 1861; the plagiarism was only found out after construction had commenced. The Malta asylum is still in use as the Mount Carmel Hospital.\n\n\n== Notable inmates ==\nMary Frances Heaton (1801–1878), who was convicted of insulting an Anglican vicar in 1837 and never released\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Wakefield\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavis, M.

This list covers a large time span and the role of a queen has changed much over the centuries, with some individual queens also shaping their own roles.

The marriage of an heir or a king was most often affected by politics and alliances were often affirmed by marriages in the royal families. It was also not permitted for a long period for royalty to marry non-royalty. Thus the choice of wife would be narrow in one's own country and most of the queens in this list are not native to their husband's country.\nDue to unions with Denmark and Sweden the queens listed for 1450–1814 were also queens of Denmark and the queens listed for 1814–1905 were also queens of Sweden.\n\n\n== Fairhair dynasty ==\n\n\n== Knýtling dynasty ==\n\n\n== Unclassified ==\n\n\n== Knýtling dynasty ==\n\n\n== St. Olaf dynasty ==\n\n\n== Knýtling dynasty ==\n\n\n== Hardrada dynasty ==\n\n\n=== Gille dynasty ===\n\n\n=== Hardrada (Skakke) dynasty ===\n\n\n== Sverre dynasty ==\n\n\n== House of Bjälbo ==\n\n\n== House of Pomerania ==\n\n\n== House of Palatinate-Neumarkt ==\n\n\n== House of Bonde ==\n\n\n== House of Oldenburg ==\n\n\n== House of Holstein-Gottorp ==\n\n\n== House of Bernadotte ==\n\n\n== House of Glücksburg ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Norwegian monarchs\n\n\n== References ==",

Troi's history with Riker had been introduced in the pilot episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, \"Encounter at Farpoint\"; this also included the word imzadi, a Betazoid term of endearment usually translated as \"beloved\". The novel expands on the meaning of imzadi when Troi explains that its literal meaning is \"the first,\" not necessarily referring to the first sexual partner but, as Troi puts it to Riker, \"the first to ever touch your soul.\"\n\n\n== Setting ==\nChapters 1 to 6, an unnumbered epilogue chapter (between chapters 10 and 11), chapters 34 to 36, and chapter 44 take place in 2408.\nChapters 7 to 10, 33, and 37 to 43 take place in 2368.\nChapters 11 to 31 take place in 2359.\nChapter 32 takes place in 2364.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventy-three-year-old Admiral William Riker is a bitter, lonely man in a slow downward spiral following the death forty years earlier of Deanna Troi, who died of undetermined causes during a peacekeeping conference with an enemy race, the Sindareen.  Riker, now the commander of an unimportant starbase, is summoned to Betazed as Deanna's mother, Lwaxana Troi, lies dying.  While going through Lwaxana's possessions after her death, Riker is reminded of how he and Deanna originally met and began their relationship on Betazed.\nIn a lengthy flashback, it is revealed that Will and Deanna met when Will was stationed on Betazed between assignments, and while there attended a wedding at which Deanna was maid of honor.  Will was instantly attracted to her and began to pursue her, though she initially rebuffed his advances, feeling that he was only interested in her physical attributes, and that he preferred quick, thrilling encounters over meaningful emotional intimacy.  Over a series of meetings, however, they began to grow closer, as Will encouraged Deanna to embrace impulsive feelings and Deanna encouraged Will to explore his more spiritual side.\nWhile visiting her favorite museum, Deanna was kidnapped by a Sindareen raiding party, and Riker's Starfleet security force shot down their small craft in the jungle.  Riker tracked them down and killed the only surviving captor, leaving Deanna and him alone together.  In the jungle, they consummated their relationship, and Deanna told Will for the first time that they are \"Imzadi.\"  However, after their return from the jungle, Lwaxana's violent objections to their relationship and Deanna's seeming compliance led Riker to drunkenly fall into bed with another woman.  Deanna discovered them together when she appeared at his living quarters, having planned to tell him she had decided to defy her mother's wishes.  Deanna and Will decided not to pursue a relationship and Riker left the planet shortly thereafter, not to meet Deanna again until they were both assigned to the Enterprise-D.\nIn the future timeline, Commodore Data, now in command of the Enterprise-F, tells Riker that scientists studying the Guardian of Forever have discovered that Deanna's death was a focal point in time, causing the creation of a parallel timeline; his intention is to comfort Riker with the idea that Deanna lives on in another universe.  Struck with a new suspicion, Admiral Riker has an autopsy performed on Deanna's corpse and discovers that she had been murdered via a poison that did not exist at the time she died.  Deducing that someone had gone back in time to murder her and deliberately alter the timeline, Admiral Riker travels to the Guardian of Forever and goes back to the time of the Sindareen peace conference on the Enterprise-D, a short while before Deanna's death.  He gives Commander Riker the antidote to the poison, and Riker administers it to Deanna.  Her death is thus prevented, but Admiral Riker does not immediately return to his timeline, indicating that the danger to her has not yet passed.\nCommodore Data has also pursued Admiral Riker through the Guardian, feeling it is his duty to preserve the timeline by any means.  He disables Commander Data and impersonates him, taking Deanna away from the peace conference with the intention of killing her.  Admiral Riker realizes Data may try this, so he locates Commander Data and with him confronts Commodore Data, and they fight.  As the peace conference attendees look on, Deanna finally becomes familiar enough with the representatives from the Sindareen (a race difficult to read empathically without sufficient exposure) to determine that they are deceiving everyone, and have no real peaceful intentions; the peace conference is only an attempt to stall for time so that their race can become more powerful.  One of the Sindareen delegates is actually from the future and had decided to go back in time and kill Deanna to prevent this dis",

    "title": "Strathmore F.C. (Dundee)",
    "content": "Strathmore Football Club was a Scottish association football club based in the city of Dundee.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe club was founded in 1876, although it later claimed an earlier foundation date, and the earliest recorded match for the club is a 5–0 defeat to Dunmore on Magdalen Green in March 1877.  The club took its name from its patron, the Earl of Strathmore.\nInto the early 1880s, there were few clubs in Dundee, and in 1880–81 the Strathie only played 6 matches, winning 2 and losing 4.  By 1883 however there had been something of an explosion, with clubs such as Balgay, East End, Perseverance, and West End having started up, and the Strathie, as one of the oldest and best established, was also one of the largest.\n\n\n=== Scottish Cup record ===\nIt was not however quite of the first tier locally.  In the regionalized Scottish Cup, the club could never get past the third round, three times falling to the biggest Dundee club, Our Boys, at that stage; the closest the club came to the fourth round was in 1883–84, twice taking the lead in front of a 2,000 crowd at Rollo's Pier thanks to a Taylor screw-shot from the by-line and Petrie finishing off a cross; Our Boys made the score 2–2 thanks to a freak goal as goalkeeper Jarvis accidentally carried the ball over the goal-line.  In the replay at West Craigie, the Strathie took the lead through a Wilkie shot, before losing 5–1 - the cause not helped by an injury to full-back Christie taking him out of the game.\n\n\n=== Forfarshire Cup ===\nIt faced similar difficulties in the leading local tournament, the Forfarshire Cup, almost always coming up short against the very top local sides; in 1887–88, the club reached the final after some considerable luck with the draw, but lost 10–2 to Arbroath at East Dock Street, in front of a crowd of 10,000.  Its best season had come the season before, in 1886–87, when it surprised Arbroath with a 4–2 first round win, and beat Arbroathian namesakes Strathmore (Arbroath) in the second - the Dundee side winning 5–4, after losing a three-goal lead, and ending the game having to shelter the referee from angry home fans. In the final the club lost 4–2 to the reigning champions Harp of Dundee.\n\n\n=== Burns Charity Cup ===\nThe club was similarly ill-starred in the local charity cups.  Twice it reached the final of the Dundee Burns Club Charity Cup, in 1885–86 and 1889–90, but lost heavily both times - 5–1 to Harp in the first and 9–1 to East End in the second, spectators being said to have lost count in the latter final, but there was considerable mitigation for the Strathie, as it played much of the match with 10 men, inside-left Anderson retiring injured when the score was 2–0.  The one consolation to the club in the 1890–91 tournament was beating Our Boys for the only time in a competitive match in the semi-final, 3–0 at East Dock Street. \n\n\n=== Trying to join the Northern League ===\nThe club's status was demonstrated by it not being accepted as a member of the new Northern League on its foundation in 1891–92, with only three clubs from Dundee being allowed in, and the voting being in favour of East End, Our Boys, and Harp; the Strathie was not even on the initial short-list of 12.   The club applied to join in 1892–93, but only obtained 2 votes, five short of what was required; another Dundee also-ran club, Johnstone Wanderers, was elected.  \nStrathie tried again in 1893–94, by which time Our Boys and East End had merged to play in the Scottish League as Dundee.  Although the club lost in the vote to Victoria United, Aberdeen, and the re-elected St Johnstone, the club had a second chance as the cash-strapped Harp - faced with \"rampant\" professionalism and having to pay as much as £3 to secure players - withdrew in protest at the abandoning of minimum admission prices, which left a vacancy.\n\n\n=== Merger with Johnstone Wanderers ===\nAfter six matches in the 1893–94 season, both Johnstone Wanderers and Strathmore announced their resignations from the Northern League, on the basis that the gate money for matches at Montrose and Victoria United of Aberdeen was not worth the candle; the Strathie was facing eviction as the Dundee F.C. committee had bought out its ground, and had been looking to share Clepington Park which led to an assumption that the Wanderers and Strathmore were effectively acting as one club.  \nThat suspicion was confirmed in January 1894 when a new club, Dundonians, was formed by merger between the Wanderers and Strathmore, and played its first match under that name against Hibernian that month.   As the media often referred to the Dundee club as \"the Dundonians\", Dundee made a formal objection, and the new club instead used the Wanderers name, usually referred to as Dundee Wanderers.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club wore the following:\n\n1880–81: scarlet and blue 1\" hoops\n1881–82: scarlet and navy blue 1½\" hoops\n1882–84: light blue jerseys and hose, and white knickers\n1884–92: 1\" black and white hooped jerseys and hose, and navy k",

    "content": "SCSI / ATA Translation (SAT) is a set of standards developed by the T10 subcommittee, defining how to communicate with ATA devices through a SCSI application layer.  The standard attempts to be consistent with the SCSI architectural model, the SCSI Primary Commands, and the SCSI Block Commands standards.\nThe standard allows for translation of SCSI read and write commands.\nThe standard also provides the ability to control exactly what ATA operations are executed on a target device by defining three new SCSI operation codes:\n\nATA PASS THROUGH (A1h, 12-byte) – 28-bit ATA command without AUXILIARY or ICC fields\nATA PASS THROUGH (85h, 16-byte) – 28- or 48-bit ATA command without AUXILIARY or ICC fields\nATA PASS THROUGH (7Fh/1FF0h, 32-byte) – 28- or 48-bit ATA command with AUXILIARY or ICC fields\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first SAT standard was finalized in 2007 and published as ANSI INCITS 431–2007. It was succeeded by SAT-2 published as INCITS 465 in 2009, and SAT-3, which was finalized by T10 and is expected to be published as INCITS 517 in 2014. SAT-4 is in development. SAT has also been adopted in 2008 as an ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25 standard, namely ISO/IEC 14776-921.\nSAT-2 was finalized in 2009. Significant additions in SAT-2 are ATAPI translations, NCQ control, \npersistent reservations, non-volatile cache translation, and ATA security mode translations. The standard also defines a new data structure returned in the sense data known as the ATA Return Descriptor that contains the ATA taskfile registers. SAT-2 was promulgated as ISO/IEC 14776–922 in 2011.\nThe later standards are:\n\nSAT-3, finalized 2014.\nSAT-4, finalized 2016, added 32-byte  ATA PASS-THROUGH command. Support additional AUXILIARY and ICC fields used by some ATA commands.\nSAT-5, started 2017, finalized 2023.\nSAT-6, started 2024. Adds translations for Command Duration Limits pages, power consumption pages, and Capacity/Product ID Mapping VPD pages. Adds GET LBA STATUS translation. DEVICE FAULT exit strategy. (As of revision 02.)\nThe T10 committee makes the drafts of unpublished future standards freely available. As of September 2025, this means that the SAT-6 draft is publicly available for free. Drafts of published versions are only accessible by committee members. Members of the public are encouraged to instead purchase the published version. Drafts of earlier versions may remain available on the Internet from those who have downloaded them before their corresponding version's publication.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nSAT is useful for enabling ATA-device-specific commands in a number of scenarios:\n\nSATA disks attached to SAS controllers\n[P]ATA or SATA disks attached via USB bridges (which actually speak SCSI over the wire either using the older USB Mass Storage Bulk-Only Transfer protocol or the newer USB Attached SCSI protocol).\n[P]ATA or SATA disks attached via FireWire bridges (which speak SCSI SBP-2 over the wire)\nSome USB external storage devices, including some USB flash drives, are using SAT to achieve some advanced features like wear leveling and/or TRIM\nA problem with many SAT implementations is that when two or more ATA devices are attached to the same SAT interface, the ATA passthrough only serves one device. This causes issues with fetching S.M.A.R.T. data, since only one device can be addressed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdvanced SCSI Programming Interface\nATA Packet Interface – the inverse, but only for non-hard drives\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Illex illecebrosus",
    "content": "Illex illecebrosus, commonly known as the northern shortfin squid, is a species of neritic squids in the family Ommastrephidae. Squids of the genus Illex account for 65% of the world's cephalopod captures. Illex is formed by four taxa distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean (I. argentinus, I. coindetii, I. illecebrosus and I. oxygonius), whose identification and phylogenetic relationships based on morphological characters remain controversial.They are found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, from off the coast of eastern North America to Greenland, Iceland, and west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. They are a highly migratory and short-lived species, with lifespans of less than a year. They are commercially important and are fished extensively (primarily by the United States and Canada), mostly for the Canadian and Japanese markets. \nNorthern shortfin squid is a migratory species of squid with a distribution ranging from Florida Straits to Newfoundland in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The species is native to Canada, Greenland, Iceland and United States. The species has an average lifespan between 1–1.5 years in which most live less than a year. The location of the fishery of the squid is mainly in Mid-Atlantic Bight from between summer and fall.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNorthern shortfin squid is a moderately-sized squid with females ranging from  20 to 30 centimetres (7.9 to 11.8 inches) in mantle length while males are generally smaller with mantle length ranging from 18 to 27 cm (7.1 to 10.6 in). Northern shortfin squid has short tentacles with a long and narrow head which is connected to the long mantle. The fins are shorter in length parallel to the mantle yet the length of the fins perpendicular to the mantle are about twice the length. The squid is reddish brown to purple in color and there is higher opacity in the head and mantle while the rest of the body are yellowish green tinted.\n\n\n== Migration & Distribution ==\nNorthern shortfin squid migrate from boreal and temperate waters to subtropical waters where they travel as far as 1,000 miles. The species is highly migratory as there are seasonal distribution patterns. The range of the species is between 66°N and 29°N where they are distributed in central Florida, Newfoundland and Labrador Spaws in South of Cape Hatteras to central Florida. They settle in oceanic and neritic zone of the ocean. There is high abundance of the species in Newfoundland and New Jersey.\n\n\n== Diet and feeding ==\nThe species mainly feeds on fish and crustaceans but it undergoes a shift from a crustacean dominated diet to a mainly fish diet. It feeds at night near the upper layers of water. Like other species of squid, cannibalism also occurs in smaller squids by larger squids. Based on the commercial catch of squid in Newfoundland in 1979, it was found that most squid prey on fish that are valuable for the market. The species feeds on many species of fish including Atlantic cod, hake, capelin, etc., in which their otoliths are found in the squid's stomach.\n\n\n== Reproduction and growth ==\n\nSpawning season for northern shortfin squid happens all year round. There are higher chances for the species to survive recruitment when it is spawned in the winter season because of the condition provided being optimal for the growth which supports the ability for the squid to perform spawning migration. The months for hatching range from June to December where it is more prevalent in July, August, September, October and November. It is found that sex does not affect the growth rate of the total body mass yet the month of hatching affects the growth rate to increase. Females grow faster compared to males and there is a linear relationship in the growth rate of the squid in which there is a swift growth measured by the increase of mantle length. Even so, the condition of the habitat also affects the differing growth rate of both sexes as male grow faster than females in Newfoundland and Nova Scotian waters. Juveniles range from the size of 34 to 66 mm (1.3 to 2.6 in) while adults may reach up to 35 cm (14 in). It is found that northern shortfin squid who lives in warmer waters grow more rapidly especially in the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n\n== Predation ==\nNorthern shortfin squid has developed behavior such as ink jetting, schooling and camouflaging as protection to prevent predation by larger fish species such as bluefin tuna, red and silver hake. Mammals such as pilot whales and dolphins also prey on the species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMartínez, P.; Pérez-Losada, M.; Guerra, A.; Sanjuan, A.

    "title": "You're charming",
    "content": "\"you're charming\" is the third episode of the fourth season of the American dark comedy crime drama television series Barry. It is the 27th overall episode of the series and was written by Emma Barrie and directed by series creator Bill Hader, who also serves as lead actor. It was first broadcast on HBO in the United States on April 23, 2023, and also was available on HBO Max on the same date.\nThe series follows Barry Berkman, a hitman from Cleveland who travels to Los Angeles to kill someone but finds himself joining an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau, where he meets aspiring actress Sally Reed and begins to question his path in life as he deals with his criminal associates such as Monroe Fuches and NoHo Hank. The previous seasons saw Barry try to decide between both lives, which culminated in his arrest. In the episode, Barry's actions unleash consequences, as Hank hires hitmen to kill him in prison. Meanwhile, Gene finds that his exaggerated description of his relationship with Barry may have severe consequences to Barry's incoming trial.\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.208 million household viewers and gained a 0.03 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the episode's humor, character development, performances and Hader's directing. For the episode, Bill Hader received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAs their crew is ecstatic over the arrival of the imported sand, Hank (Anthony Carrigan) and Cristobal (Michael Irby) meet with \"Toro\" (Guillermo del Toro), who has agreed to send two hitmen to kill Barry (Bill Hader).\nDistrict Attorney Buckner (Charles Parnell) informs Gene (Henry Winkler) and Tom Posorro (Fred Melamed) that Barry is making a deal with the FBI and advises them not to talk. Gene tells Tom about the one-man performance he gave to Lon O'Neil (Patrick Fischler), causing Tom say that they must stop the article from being published. In prison, Barry has informed the FBI agents about Hank and Cristobal's relationship. They intend to honor their deal, informing him that his companion, Sally (Sarah Goldberg), will have to be questioned as she must leave her life behind. Lon O'Neil visits prison for comment from Barry, who shouts that Gene should keep silent. Lon then visits Jim (Robert Wisdom), telling him he spoke with Gene.\nSally has started teaching her own acting class and the attendees are aware of her recent scandals. Fuches (Stephen Root) is discreetly told by Hank of the upcoming hit. Batir (JB Blanc) surprises Hank in the compound and offers him an ultimatum: kill the crew or be killed by Chechen reinforcements. Meanwhile, Gene and Tom break into Lon's house, and meet Lon's wife, who directs them to Jim. Jim rebukes Gene for talking and says that he spoke to Lon in his garage. Lon arrives home, with no evidence of anything, now speaking only in German due to Jim's psychological torture.\nWhile hearing monologues, Sally is taken aback by a performer, Kristen (Ellyn Jameson), who arrived unprepared. She humiliates her in front of the class as Gene once did to her and Kristen confidently recites the \"I am big! It's the pictures that got small\" line from Sunset Boulevard. Sally excuses her method as one of Gene's, but the entire class leaves except for Kristen, who has booked a gig and wants Sally's help. Back in prison, Barry calls Hank and claims that Gene has information on the Chechens. Hank confronts Barry on his lies, stating he knows that he talked to the FBI.\nInspired by Rain Man, Fuches decides to warn the officers about the hit on Barry, but isn't taken seriously. Barry has been escorted to meet WITSEC Agent James Curtis (Dan Bakkedahl) and identifies a nervous official to the agents as a hitman. The hitman, Nestor (Fred Armisen), blows off his own finger with his faulty gadget gun pen. His brother Chuy, hiding in the ceiling, kills everyone but Barry, who retrieves a gun, kills Chuy, and sneaks away, while the prison is placed on lockdown. Warden Reynolds (Richard Riehle) and two guards arrive at the massacre with Barry nowhere to be found.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn April 2023, the episode's title was revealed as \"you're charming\" and it was announced that Emma Barrie had written the episode while series creator and lead actor Bill Hader had directed it. This was Barrie's second writing credit, and Hader's thirteenth directing credit.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nThe episode featured a guest appearance by Guillermo del Toro, who appears as a criminal known as \"El Toro\" to help Hank and Cristobal in killing Barry. Del Toro had expressed admiration for the series and is friends with Hader, asking for a part in the series. Hader wrote the role specifically for him, and del Toro accepted, bringing his own cane to use in character.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe episode was watched by 0",

Following his promotion to colonel in November 1776, Alden was assigned to the 7th Massachusetts Regiment. The regiment was stationed at Cherry Valley, New York in the summer of 1778. Although commanding 200–300 men, Alden's limited military experience and lack of knowledge regarding Indigenous tactics would prove to be a great disadvantage. He and several of his officers billeted well away from the fort in the homes of some of the inhabitants. Despite receiving a warning of an impeding attack from the American allied Oneida, Alden made few preparations.\nOn November 11, 1778, a combined force of 320 Seneca led by Cornplanter and Little Beard, 150 Butler's Rangers and a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot under Captain Walter Butler, and a small group of Mohawk led by Joseph Brant launched a surprise attack on Cherry Valley. While the Rangers and regulars blockaded Fort Alden, the Seneca rampaged through the village, killing and scalping 16 soldiers and 32 civilians, mostly women and children, and taking 70 captives. Alden was killed attempting to reach the fort from an outlying house. His second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel William Stacy, was taken prisoner. The attack would later trigger an expedition led by Major General John Sullivan that destroyed 40 Seneca and Cayuga villages in the summer of 1779.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Canon de 240 modèle 93/96 TAZ",
    "content": "The Canon de 240 modèle 93/96 TAZ was a French Coastal Defense and Railway gun used by the French Army during World War I and by the German Army during World War II.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in.  Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery.  Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns.\nBig caliber land weapons were less prevalent than large caliber naval guns because of their weight, complexity, and immobility. This created a contradiction for artillery designers of the era. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use.  Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile.  Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Canon de 240 modèle 93/96 started life as eight Canon de 240 de côte modèle 1893 coastal defense guns that were removed from fortifications at Dakar in Senegal and Saigon in Vietnam.  Because of this, the guns were often referred to as \"colonies\" mounts.  The eight gun barrels were placed on the existing rail carriages for the Canon de 305 modèle 93/96 TAZ manufactured by the firm of St Chamond.  The carriages were originally deployed in 1916 but it was too much gun for too little carriage so the 305 mm (12 in) barrels were replaced with 240 mm (9.4 in) barrels by St Chamond and entered service in 1918.\nThe guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles.  The guns sat on a top carriage traversing mount which sat on a large diameter geared steel ring.  A rectangular steel firing platform sat on top of the platform with the barrel of the gun overhanging the platform at the front with an overhanging loading platform for the gunners to the rear.  The firing platform was then traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base.  To load the gun the barrel was lowered and there was an elevated shell handling trolley at the rear.  The guns had a hydro-pneumatic cradle recoil system where the cradle recoiled up a slightly inclined +4° rear deck which helped return the gun to battery after firing.  The gun could be elevated between +15° and +35° when firing across the tracks but was limited to +29° when parallel because the breach of the gun would not have enough room to recoil without hitting the carriage.\nThe carriages consisted of rectangular steel bases, which were suspended on two railroad bogies.  Each bogie had six axles.  The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle.  Since the barrels were coastal defense guns that were not intended for use at high angles of elevation the trunnions were relocated relatively far forward and the guns were nose heavy.  The carriage used ground platform anchoring and site preparation included laying wooden beams parallel to the tracks then splicing in a section of rail bed reinforced with wooden beams under the center which the carriage was lowered onto.  Outriggers and ground anchors were also used to stabilize the gun once in firing position as well as five screw jacks.  Although the mount was capable to 360° of traverse it was often limited to 10° left/right of the centerline because of problems with balance and recoil which hampered the earlier Canon de 305 modèle 93/96 TAZ.  For this reason, the weapon was not considered a success.\n\n\n== Coastal defense ==\nThe eight Canon de 240 modèle 93/96 TAZ guns remained in reserve between the two world wars and were mobilized during 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. Four guns were assigned to the 10th and 11th Heavy Artillery Batteries of the 374° Regiment of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferrée) in the South of France facing the Italians.  After the French surrender, the guns were assigned the German designations 24 cm Kanone (E) 558 (f) or 24 cm Kanone (E) Model 93/96 (f).  In German service, they reverted to their coastal defense role and in 1942 they were integrated into Germany's Atlantic Wall defenses.  Four guns were located at St. Nazaire in France while another four were located in Norway first at Narvik from 1942 to 1944 and later at Naerbo from 1944 to 1945.\n\n\n== Ammunition ==\nAPC (Armor Piercing Capp",

    "title": "Amelia (1795 ship)",
    "content": "Amelia was built in France in 1787. The British captured her in 1793. She became a general trader that made one voyage as a whaler in the British southern whale fishery before returning to trading. She also made one voyage as a slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people. She was last listed in 1806, but the data is stale.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAlthough the British captured Amelia in 1793, she does not appear in Lloyd's Register until 1795. At that time her master is Whitock, her owner is Lushington, and her trade is London—St Vincent.\nIn late 1795 and early 1796, Amelia sailed as part of Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian's expedition to the West Indies. After numerous false starts aborted by weather issues, the fleet sailed on 26 April to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada. It is not clear when Amelia returned to Britain.\nLloyd's Register for 1798 shows Amelia's master as Scott, her owner as Lushington, and her trade as South Seas Fishery.\nAmelia was at Rio de Janeiro in June 1797 to replenish her food and water. She was reported to have been at the Galapagos in August/September 1798 She returned to England in March 1799.\nThe Register of Shipping for 1800 reported that W. Scott was still master of Amelia, and that her trade was London—Cape of Good Hope. Lloyd's Register for 1800 showed Amelia's master changing to Higgins, and her owner to Sims. The 1801 volume confirmed the changes and showed Amelia's trade as Liverpool—Africa, something that generally signals a slave trader. Amelia, Isaac Higgins, master, John Sims, owner, sailed from London to West Central Africa on 13 October 1800. She sailed from Falmouth only on 14 January 1801. She arrived at Jamaica on 21 August 1801 with 267.\nAmelia left Jamaica for London, but then had to put back because she had become leaky.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nClayton, J.

Willem I ordered that two regiments would be formed to replace the Swiss, to serve as his guards. Both served with distinction, especially during the Second World War in the defence of The Hague. The regiment was formed in 1995 by the amalgamation of two antecedent regiments, the Garderegiment Grenadiers (Grenadiers Guards Regiment) and the Garderegiment Jagers (Rifles Guards Regiment).\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe regiment's single battalion currently serves in the airmobile role as part of 11 Luchtmobiele (Airmobile) Brigade. It is organised with an HQ Company (Stafcompagnie), a heavy weapons company (Zwarewapenscompagnie) and three infantry companies (Infanteriecompagnie). The three infantry companies and the anti-tank company perpetuate the two antecedent regiments, with 'A' (Koningscompagnie) and 'D' (Wolvencompagnie) companies being classed as Grenadiers and 'B' (Stiercompagnie) and 'C' (Tijgercompagnie) Companies being classed as Jagers (Rifles).\nThe regiment has a museum in Arnhem.\n\n\n== Bands ==\nServing the Guards in musical support,  the few numbers of military bands in service, are the Royal Military Band \"Johan Willem Friso\" and the Traditional Grenadier Bugle Band of the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment (Grenadiers) and the Veterans Fanfare band and Bugles and Fanfare orchestra of the Grenadiers and Rifles (Rifles). These are the only bands in service in the Guards units of the RNA as the Band and Corps of Drums of the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene remain disbanded.

The diocese was created in 1987, when the Diocese of Bacolod was split into three dioceses. The other new diocese created is the Diocese of San Carlos, which covers the northeastern part of Negros Island and includes former parishes of the Diocese of Dumaguete in Negros Oriental province. The Diocese of Kabankalan is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Jaro like the other two dioceses of Negros Occidental.\nThe titular patron of the diocese is Francis Xavier whose feast is celebrated every December 3.

He was the youngest of six children to William and Louisa (née Fowler); his father worked as a potter's presser. Underwood worked as a potter's flowerer as a child and worked as a potter's presser as an adult.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nUnderwood was born in Hanley, Staffordshire and in his youth played in the local church league for Hanley Tabernacle and Etruria along with Bill Rowley. He and Rowley joined Stoke in 1887 in time for the first season of the Football League. Underwood made his league debut on 8 September 1888, at full-back for Stoke in a 2–0 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at the Victoria Ground. He played all of Stoke's 22 Football League matches in 1888–89. Underwood played at left-back in Stoke's first season in the Football League and missed only one match in the next three seasons (at Walsall in 1891). He retired in 1893 when he was only 24 after he cut his knee and the wound became infected, although he was still called up to play occasionally afterwards. Underwood then worked in the local pot banks but suffered many health problems which led to his death in 1928.\n\n\n== Professional Baseball ==\nIn 1890 Underwood played professional baseball for Stoke in the National League of Baseball of Great Britain.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe went on to win two full England caps, appearing alongside fellow Stoke teammates Bill Rowley and Tommy Clare.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\nUnderwood stood at 6 ft tall and weighed 13 st and along with Tommy Clare, formed an imposing barricade and were often referred to as a pair rather than an individual. Underwood's balding head and sunken eyes gave him a demonic appearance.\nHis main assets were his heavy tackles and his long clearances. Members of the local press often criticised him for being too impetuous and rash. He occasionally mis-kicked his clearances and on one occasion against Accrington in September 1888, he hoofed the ball vertically in the air which resulted in Accrington scoring an easy goal. This led to The Sentinel claiming that Underwood should stop trying to break windows.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n=== International ===\nSource:\n\n\n== Honours ==\nStoke\n\nFootball Alliance: 1890–91\n'England\n\nBritish Home Championship: 1890–91\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlf Underwood at England Football Online \nAlf Underwood at Englandstats.com",

    "title": "Lapérouse-class cruiser",
    "content": "The Lapérouse class was a group of four wooden-hulled unprotected cruisers of the French Navy built in the mid-1870s and early 1880s. The class comprised Lapérouse—the lead ship—D'Estaing, Nielly, and Primauguet. They were designed to operate overseas in the French colonial empire, and they were ordered as part of a construction program intended to strengthen the fleet after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. They carried a main battery of fifteen 138.6 mm (5.46 in) guns, had a top speed of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph), and had a full ship rig to supplement their steam engines during lengthy voyages abroad.\nAll four ships of the class were sent to East Asia during the Tonkin campaign, which led to the Sino-French War, in the mid-1880s. D'Estaing saw action at the Battle of Fuzhou, the Keelung campaign, the Battle of Tamsui, and the Pescadores campaign, while Nielly took part in the Battle of Shipu. Lapérouse participated in the blockade of Formosa, along with her other two sisters, but Primauguet arrived too late to take part in operations against Chinese forces. In 1895, Primauguet served as the flagship of the Indian Ocean division during the Second Madagascar expedition, which resulted in the conquest of Madagascar. Lapérouse was wrecked at Madagascar in 1898, and the three remaining members of the class were withdrawn from service in 1900–1901. Nielly and D'Estaing were broken up soon after being removed from service, but Primauguet remained in use as a hulk until 1907, when she too was sold for scrap.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nIn the aftermath of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, the French Navy was forced to drastically reduce naval spending and consolidate its forces. The Navy adopted a new construction plan in 1872, which envisioned a fleet for operations in home waters and one to patrol overseas to protect French interests abroad. The squadrons that were to support the French colonial empire were to consist of a small number of second class ironclad warships supported by a large number of wooden cruising vessels. \nTo provide new cruisers under the program, the French Minister of the Navy, Louis Raymond de Montaignac de Chauvance, forwarded a pair of designs to the Conseil des Travaux (Council of Works) on 8 March 1875. The minister had requested designs that strengthened the armament compared to earlier cruisers while keeping displacement similar, at the cost of speed. The two proposals, which the council reviewed on 28 May, were prepared by Victorin Sabattier and Arthur Bienaymé, the latter based on his earlier Infernet-class cruisers. They were similar vessels, armed with fifteen 138.6 mm (5.46 in) guns, all on the upper deck, forecastle, and sterncastle.\nThe council requested that six of the 138.6 mm guns be replaced with 164.7 mm (6.48 in) guns. They also suggested adding a short section of armor amidships around the funnel uptakes, reflecting the experience at the Battle of Havana, where the French aviso Bouvet was disabled by gunfire that damaged her funnel. Sabattier's design became the Villars class, while Bienaymé's proposal was chosen for the Lapérouse class, but neither of the council's recommendations were adopted. Bienaymé's hull lines were superior to Sabattier's design, resulting in greater speed for the Lapérouse class. Four ships were ordered to the design: Lapérouse, D'Estaing, Nielly, and Primauguet; Primauguet was initially named Monge, but was renamed during construction.\n\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n\nThe ships of the Lapérouse class were 79.5 m (260 ft 10 in) long at the waterline and 81.75 m (268 ft 3 in) long between perpendiculars. They had a beam of 11.4 m (37 ft 5 in) and an average draft of 5.3 m (17 ft 5 in) forward and 5.8 m (19 ft 0 in) aft. They displaced 2,320 t (2,280 long tons; 2,560 short tons) as designed. The ships had a pronounced ram bow, a short, open forecastle deck, and an overhanging stern. They were wooden-hulled, but used iron beams to strengthen their structure. In 1890, Lapérouse had her forecastle enclosed, and she received a short spar deck around her funnel that provided additional sheltered space. An enclosed shelter for her bridge was installed as well. Their crew amounted to 264 officers and enlisted men.\nThe ships' propulsion system consisted of a single horizontal compound steam engine driving a screw propeller. Steam was provided by six coal-burning fire-tube boilers; D'Estaing's were ducted into a single funnel, while the other three ships had a pair of closely spaced funnels place side-by-side and partially enclosed by a single outer casing. Their machinery was rated to produce 2,160 indicated horsepower (1,610 kW) for a top speed of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). All of the ships save D'Estaing carried 317 t (312 long tons; 349 short tons) of coal for their boilers; D'Estaing carried slightly less, at 315 t (310 long tons; 347 short tons). At a more economical speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph), the ships could steam for",

The centre hosts classes, workshops, art exhibitions, music performances (of heavy metal, blues, folk and punk music), stand-up comedy, and small-scale and intimate theatre.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nOpening in 1975 in the former West End Junior School once attended by comedian Arthur English, the West End Centre (or the 'Westy') is described as \"the creative hub of Aldershot and the surrounding areas\". It was originally run by volunteers and faced closure in its early years until the Poet Laureate John Betjeman had the building locally listed. The Graeae Theatre Company was based at the Centre from 1981 to 1982.\nWhen managed by Hampshire County Council the centre faced closure again in 2007 until public protests forced the decision to be reversed. Every year since 2006 the West End Centre has held the Summer Westival which creates an indoor music festival complete with real grass throughout the venue.\nPerformers who have appeared at the centre include Andy Parsons, Matt Forde, Sam Simmons, Roger McGough, Seann Walsh, Stewart Lee, Adrian Henri, Shappi Khorsandi, Miriam Margolyes, Omid Djalili, Dara Ó Briain, Jimmy Carr, Dave Gorman, Tony Hawks Daniel Kitson, Simon Munnery, Nish Kumar, Phill Jupitus, Justin Moorhouse, Pete Firman and Al Murray.\nBands who have appeared at the WEC include Blur, Happy Mondays, Stone Roses, Spiritualized, A, Primal Scream, Manic Street Preachers, Peter Green, Chas & Dave, Foals, The 1975, Biffy Clyro, The Temperance Movement, Nine Below Zero, Funeral for a Friend, PJ Harvey, The Xcerts and We Are the Ocean.

    "title": "Srinagar",
    "content": "Srinagar is a city in Indian-administered  Jammu and Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the largest city and summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an Indian-administered union territory. It lies in the Kashmir Valley along the banks of the Jhelum River, and the shores of Dal Lake and Anchar Lakes, between the Hari Parbat and Shankaracharya hills. The city is known for its natural environment, various gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like the Kashmir shawl (made of pashmina and cashmere wool), papier-mâché, wood carving, carpet weaving, and jewel making, as well as for dried fruits. It is the second-largest metropolitan area in the Himalayas (after Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal).\nFounded in the 6th century during the rule of the Gonanda dynasty according to the Rajatarangini, the city took on the name of an earlier capital thought to have been founded by the Mauryas in its vicinity. The city remained the most important capital of the Kashmir Valley under the Hindu dynasties, and was a major centre of learning. During the 14th–16th centuries the city's old town saw major expansions, particularly under the Shah Mir dynasty, whose kings used various parts of it as their capitals. It became the spiritual centre of Kashmir, and attracted several Sufi preachers. It also started to emerge as a hub of shawl weaving and other Kashmiri handicrafts. In the late 16th century, the city became part of the Mughal Empire, many of whose emperors used it as their summer resort. Many Mughal gardens were built in the city and around Dal lake during this time, of which Shalimar and Nishat are the most well-known.\nAfter passing through the hands of the Afghan Durranis and the Sikhs in the late 18th and early 19th century, it eventually became the summer capital of the Dogra kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. The city became a popular tourist destination among Europeans and Indian elites during this time, with several hotels and its iconic houseboats being built. In 1952, the city became the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, a region administered by India as a state, with Jammu being its winter capital. It was the flashpoint of violence during the 1990s and early 2000s insurgency in the region. In 2019, it became the summer capital of a smaller region which is administered by India as a union territory, after the former state's reorganisation.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe earliest records, such as Kalhana's Rajatarangini, mentions the Sanskrit name shri-nagara which have been interpreted distinctively by scholars in two ways: one being \"The city of \"Śrī\" (श्री), the Hindu goddess of prosperity, meaning \"City of Lakshmi\"\nand other being sūrya-nagar, meaning \"City of the Surya\" (trans) \"City of Sun.\" The name was used for an older capital in the vicinity of the present-day city, before being used for it. Between the 14th and 19th centuries, and especially during Mughal rule, the city was also referred to simply as Kashmir or Shahr-i-Kashmir (lit. 'City of Kashmir').\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nAccording to the Rajatarangini of Kalhana, a capital city by the name of Srinagari was built in the Kashmir valley by Ashoka. Kalhana calls this capital puranadhisthana, Sanskrit for 'old capital', identified as present-day Pandrethan, 3.5 kilometres south-east of Srinagar. A 'new capital' was built by king Pravarasena, called Parvarapura, in 6th century CE. Srinagari continued to be used as a name for this capital. This new capital was located at the base of the Hari Parbat hill on the right bank of the Jhelum, corresponding to the location of modern-day Srinagar. Kalhana describes the capital having several markets, mansions, wooden houses, grand temples and canals, and also refers to the Dal lake and Jhelum river. A long embankment was constructed on the Jhelum by Pravarasena to protect the city from floods, parts of which have survived to the present day. The two capitals are also mentioned in the chronicle of Chinese traveller Huein Tsang who visited the city in 631 CE. Although several other capitals of Kashmir were constructed by other rulers over the next few centuries, Pravarasena's Srinagar survived as the capital. The city was divided into several parts, each with its own guardian deity, which continue to be worshipped by Hindu Kashmiris. The 8th century scholar Adi Shankara visited the city and founded the Shankaracharya Temple here, at the site of the earlier Jyeshteshwara Temple. The city gradually extended to the left bank of the Jhelum river, and in the early 12th century the royal palace was shifted to this side.\n\n\n=== Sultanate period ===\n\nRinchana, a Buddhist convert to Islam who briefly ruled Kashmir in the early 14th century, built the first mosque in Kashmir on the site of a Buddhist temple in a colony of Srinagar built by him. The Muslim rulers that came after him established their capitals in areas of present-day old city Srinagar",

Headquartered in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Brogent is a technology company using diversified software and hardware integration and rich experience in digital content creation to create cutting edge experiences for theme and amusement parks, museums, zoos, aquariums and other tourist destinations. The scope can cover software and hardware research and development, manufacturing and system integration, site design planning and construction. The company can provide single-component systems as well as complete turnkey projects.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2001 Brogent was established in Kaohsiung, and in the early days of entrepreneurship founder C.H. Ouyang led the team to complete many government and corporate bids for mobile application software interfaces and 3D websites. In 2008 E-DA Theme Park in Kaohsiung contracted Brogent to build a panoramic flying attraction called \"Beautiful Formosa\". At that time, Brogent did not have any experience with simulator equipment supply. The company's team was a group of software engineers. Faced with the opportunity to deliver a unique project to E-DA Theme Park, C.H. Ouyang firmly believed that Brogent could develop the technology to supply this kind of media based motion base attraction and led the team to spend two years of research, and finally developed a now patented ride system and successfully opened a flying theater designed and manufactured in Taiwan in 2010.\nAfter integrating the technologies of various fields of expertise such as moving seats, audio visual systems and special effects systems and successfully opening the first flying theater attraction to the public, Brogent attracted the attention of the international theme park market and in 2010, it was contracted to produce Canada's first flying theater FlyOver Canada. The Flying Theater was built on the second floor of Canada Place, a famous cruise terminal in Vancouver, Canada, and in addition to the difficult on-site construction, it also faced the challenge of high-specification design changes. The team faced a lot of difficulties, but finally in 2013, FlyOver Canada was successfully opened, welcoming 4.3 million visitors with its first 10 years or operation.\nSince the first overseas flying theater Brogent has continued to expand its footprint in the location based entertainment market and is now in a leading position in the global flying theater segment. The majority of the projects listed on a blocoloop list of the worlds's 13 top flying theaters published in 2020 is supplied by Brogent.\n\n\n== Selected projects ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

He also directed an orchestra and taught piano.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFinger was born in Willesden, England, and educated at King's College London.  He had a strong literary and musical formation, and was quite active in the Fabian movement. Finger was a keen disciple of Walt Whitman. As a youth and young man he reveled in the homosociality of the Regent Street Polytechnic created by Quintin Hogg, and as a bisexual, throughout his life he sought to create communities of like-minded readers. Intrinsic to his literary accomplishments were his future life in South America and Texas, and his love of men. At age 20 he began to travel extensively, visiting first Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia, where he worked as gold seeker, guide, and cook for the first sheep farming stations, in the period of Selknam genocide. He moved to New York and London, thereafter, and to a number of cities in Texas. He worked as an accountant and musician, eventually settling in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he began to concentrate on writing. \nIn 1902, Finger married Eleanor (Nellie) Ferguson, daughter of a sheep rancher, with whom he would have five children.\nHe became the acting editor of the Reedy's Mirror after William Marion Reedy's death in 1920.\nFinger won the 1925 Newbery Medal for the book Tales from Silver Lands (1924), a collection of stories from Central and South America.  Some of his other works are Bushrangers (1924), Tales Worth Telling (1927), Courageous Companions (1929), and A Dog at His Heel (1936). His autobiography is Seven Horizons (1930).\nFinger was an accomplished musician.  He directed the San Angelo Conservatory of Music in Texas, from 1898 to 1904. One of his piano students in San Angelo was David Wendel Guion, who achieved notability for arranging and popularizing the ballad \"Home on the Range\".\nFinger, whose daughter Helen Finger was a lithographer, took special pains to promote the work of Arkansas painter and lithographer James Duard Marshall.  Helen Finger and James Duard Marshall had worked together teaching adult art classes in Fayetteville, Arkansas, under the Federal Emergency Relief Act.\nThe epitaph on Finger's gravestone is \"This voyage done, set sail and steer once more\nTo further landfall on some nobler shore.\" He is buried in the Farmington, Arkansas cemetery.\n\n\n== Literary works ==\n\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFinger, C.

    "title": "Rumberas film",
    "content": "The Rumberas film (in Spanish, Cine de rumberas) was a film genre that flourished in Mexico's Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. Its major stars were the so-called rumberas, dancers of Afro-Caribbean musical rhythms. The genre is a film curiosity, one of the most fascinating hybrids of the international cinema.\nToday, thanks to their unique characteristics, they are considered cult films. The Rumberas film is one of the contributions of Mexican cinema to international cinema. The Rumberas film represented a social view of the Mexico of the 1940s and 1950s, specifically of those women considered sinners and prostitutes, who confronted the moral and social conventions of their time. The genre was a more realistic approach to the Mexican society of that time. It was melodramas about the lives of these women, who were redeemed through exotic dances.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe rumberas were the dancers and actresses that swayed to Afro-Caribbean rhythms in Mexican cinema's Golden Age of the 1940s and 1950s. The term rumbera comes from the so-called Cuban rumba that was popular in Mexico and Latin America from the late 19th century to the early 1950s. Eventually new tropical rhythms such as the mambo and the cha-cha-chá displaced the Cuban rumba as the most popular Latin music genre; the rumberas adopted these new rhythms and used them in their films.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe rumberas films have their roots in various film genres. The film noir, very popular in Hollywood and other film industries in the 1930s and 1940s, can be considered their cornerstone, given the urban environment of the genre. Film noir was characterized by having among its protagonists the femme fatales, the cabaret women who aroused the passions of men and were often the source of conflict in the plot. Gloria Grahame and Rita Hayworth created film noir images of women who enjoy singing cabaret and simultaneously make men suffer. Their other base was the Hollywood musical of the 1930s, epitomized by Busby Berkeley and his famous colorful and extravagant musical numbers endowed with a deep aesthetic expression. Although not in such stylized form (due to limited budgets), rumberas films tried to imitate in their musical numbers the guidelines of the genre. Finally, the film genre was enriched by the Urban social cinema or melodramatic films, whose principal artisan in Mexico was the filmmaker Alejandro Galindo. All this mix of elements and genres can be considered the basis of rumberas film.\nIn the Rumberas films the main heroines are women, generally humble and naive, who, because of a bad move of fate, are forced to fall into the underworld of prostitution and get involved with gangsters and pimps. These women suffered through most of the time. The plot allowing them only a few moments of pleasure in the movie. Invariably the \"sinner woman\" had to find her punishment. The stars of this genre became objects of worship, but also of criticism and contempt of the hypocritical judgment of the hearings.\nIn general, Mexican cinema was characterized by representing the prostitute as the main figure on numerous occasions, from the good-hearted prostitute represented in Santa (1932), to the tragic prostitute reflected in Woman of the Port (1934). In the Rumberas films, these tragic heroines also danced and radiated sensuality.\n\n\n=== Origins in vaudeville ===\nThe rumberas first came to the theatrical stage in the late 19th century, at the time of vaudeville and burlesque, accompanying the many comedians and buffs of Cuban origin who settled in Mexico City. From the early 20th century until the 1920s, in the age of the great Mexican vedettes of the frivolous theater (as María Conesa or Lupe Vélez), rumba dancers began to emerge. Lolita Téllez Wood is popularly considered the first dancer to popularize West Indian rhythms. During the course of the next decade, many rumberas and vedettes from Cuba came to Mexico.\n\n\n== In the cinema ==\nThe concept of the \"rumbera\" has been embodied in Mexican cinema since the first talkies in the early 1930s. The actress Maruja Griffel was the first to dance the rumba, in the film ¡Que viva México! (Sergei Eisenstein, 1931). She was followed by others such as Consuelo Moreno in Mujeres sin alma, ¿Venganza suprema?, Rita Montaner in La noche del pecado (1933), and Margarita Mora in Águila o Sol (1937). In addition, the Puerto Rican actress Mapy Cortés (called \"The Rumbera Blanca\") was famous for dancing the conga in numerous films. Lolita Téllez Wood participated in three Mexican films: El rosal bendito (Juan Bustillo Oro, 1936), Mujeres de hoy (Ramón Peon, 1936) and Honrarás a tus padres (1936), the latter directed by Juan Orol, considered the \"spiritual father\" of the rumberas film.\nJuan Orol was born in Spain but grew up in Cuba, where he lived in the \"solares\", as they are known in Cuba to the low-income neighborhoods. There he had much contact with people of African origin, who him taught all their dancing tech",

He did not break through in the first team, and was first sent on loan to Ikapa Sporting, then permanently to Chippa United. With Chippa United, he won promotion and helped establish the club in the Premier Division, and eventually became team captain. In 2019 he played his 100th Premier Division game for Chippa United.\nAccording to Mbenyane, the Chippa United squad was given \"a scare\" in the winter of 2019 when the club released 13 players, resulting in the remaining players no longer \"dragging their feet at training\". In March 2020, it was reported that Mbenyane himself would be released by Chippa United after 11 years in the club. As the manager Rulani Mokwena allegedly had \"identified deadwood\" in the squad, there were talks about disciplinary problems and missing practices. Club owner Siviwe \"Chippa\" Mpengesi accused Mbenyane of growing too content in the club, and asked the player to \"come to the party and pick up his socks\". The player was not released, however, and started yet another season with Chippa United in 2020–21.\nMbenyane was injured during the spring of 2021, and could not take part in the 2020-21 Nedbank Cup final. Mbenyane was subsequently released during the summer of 2021. According to Chippa Mpengesi, this was \"painful\", but happened at the behest of new manager Gavin Hunt. In the fall of 2021 Mbenyane reportedly trained with Second Division club BCM Stars. He was back in Chippa United's matchday squad in February 2022. His first goal during this spell in the club came in the 2023-24 Nedbank Cup against Ravens.\nMbenyane retired from soccer in May 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMbenyane was married to Ahluma Nombulelo Kala Mbenyane, who died in a car accident in 2015.

    "title": "Dobrica Ćosić",
    "content": "Dobrica Ćosić (Serbian Cyrillic: Добрица Ћосић, pronounced [dǒbritsa tɕôːsitɕ]; 29 December 1921 – 18 May 2014) was a Yugoslav and Serbian writer, politician and political theorist.\nĆosić was twice awarded the prestigious NIN award for literature and Medal of Pushkin for his writing. His books have been translated into 30 languages.\nHe was the first President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with his tenure lasting from 1992 to 1993. Admirers sometimes refer to him as the Father of the Nation due to his influence on modern Serbian politics and the national revival movement in the late 1980s while his opponents use that term in an ironic manner.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nĆosić was born as Dobrosav Ćosić on 29 December 1921 in the Serbian village of Velika Drenova near Trstenik to parents father Žika and mother Milka (d. 15 October 1984). Some sources have incorrectly stated his date of birth as 4 January 1922.\nBefore the Second World War he was able to attend vocational agriculture school in Valjevo. He joined the communist youth organization in Negotin in 1939. When the Second World War reached Yugoslavia in 1941, he joined the communist Partisans. After the liberation of Belgrade in October 1944, he remained active in communist leadership positions, including work in the Serbian republican Agitation and Propaganda commission and then as a people's representative from his home region. In the early 1950s, he visited the Goli otok political prison, where the Yugoslav authorities imprisoned political opponents of the Communist Party. Ćosić maintained that he did so in order to better understand the Communist system. Ćosić wrote his first novel Daleko je sunce (The Sun is Far Away) in 1951. The novel was a success and made him popular, launching him into a literary career where he could express his revolutionary ideals. By that time, he had quit working professionally for the Communist Party.\nIn 1956 he found himself in Budapest during the Hungarian revolt. He arrived there for the meeting of the editors of literary magazines in socialist countries on the day when the revolution started and remained there until October 31 when he was transported back to Belgrade on a plane that brought in Yugoslav Red Cross help. It remains unclear whether this was purely a coincidence or he was sent there as a Yugoslav secret agent. Nevertheless, he even held political speeches in favor of a revolution in Budapest and upon his return he wrote a detailed report on the matter which, by some opinions, greatly affected and shaped firm official Yugoslav view on the whole situation. Parts of his memories and thoughts on the circumstances later will be published under the name Seven Days in Budapest.\nIn late 1956 Ćosić was chosen to participate in the formation of a new program for the Communist Party. Tito and Edvard Kardelj both picked Ćosić to sit on the committee along with other prominent Yugoslav communists. When it was completed in 1958, Ćosić had claimed that he himself wrote parts of it, including the chapter on \"Social-Economic System\". Ćosić was concerned about the program's neglect of culture and pressed for more attention to be given to the role of culture in socialism but Kardelj, who was the final arbiter, was unresponsive to these concerns.\n\n\n== In opposition ==\nUntil the early 1960s, Ćosić was devoted to Marshal Tito and his vision of a harmonious Yugoslavia. In 1961, he joined Tito on a 72-day tour by presidential yacht (the Galeb) to visit eight African non-aligned countries. The trip aboard the Galeb highlighted the close, affirmative relationship that Ćosić had with the administration until the early 1960s.\nBetween 1961 and 1962, Ćosić got involved in a lengthy polemic with the Slovenian intellectual Dušan Pirjevec regarding the relationship between autonomy, nationalism and centralism in Yugoslavia. Pirjevec voiced the opinions of the Communist Party of Slovenia which supported a more decentralized development of Yugoslavia with respect for local autonomies, while Ćosić argued for a stronger role of the Federal authorities, warning against the rise of peripheral nationalisms. The polemic, which was the first public and open confrontation of different visions within the Yugoslav Communist Party after World War II, ended with Tito's support of Ćosić's arguments. Nevertheless, actual political measures undertaken after 1962 actually followed the positions voiced by Pirjevec and the Slovenian Communist leadership. Precipitated by a slow economy, opposing sides came to use Ćosić and Pirjevec as proxies in their battles for a competing vision of Yugoslavia in the early to mid-1960s.\nAs the government gradually decentralized administration of Yugoslavia after 1963, Ćosić grew convinced that the Serbian population of the state was imperiled. In May 1968, he gave a celebrated speech to the Fourteenth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Serbian League of Communists, in which he condemned the then-current natio",

    "title": "Chalcedonian schism",
    "content": "The Chalcedonian schism, also known as the Monophysite schism, is the break of communion between the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Great Church (which later became the Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church) in the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon. Although the bishops at Chalcedon greatly respected Cyril of Alexandria and used his writings as a benchmark for orthodoxy, opponents of the council believed that the Chalcedonian Definition, which states that Christ is \"acknowledged in Two Natures\", was too close to Nestorianism and contradicts Cyril's formula \"one nature of God the Word incarnate\". The Council had also deposed the Pope of Alexandria, Dioscorus, but his supporters continued to consider him their rightful Pope, refusing to recognise the council-appointed Proterius.\nThe anti-Chalcedonian strongholds were in Egypt, Palestine and later Syria. Over the next century, their communities gradually separated from the official church of the Byzantine Empire, eventually becoming the Oriental Orthodox Churches. The imperial government made many attempts to mend the schism, generally by trying to compromise between the two positions, but these attempts only created further heresies and schisms. The Arab conquests of the Levant and of Egypt in the 7th century fossilised the schism, but ecumenical dialogue between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian Christians has been renewed since the 20th century.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Council of Ephesus ===\n\nLeading up to the 430s, the theological Schools of Alexandria and of Antioch had been developing slightly different views on Christology. Antiochene theologians such as Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret of Cyrrhus had a \"Word-man\" Christology, or \"Christology from below\", which placed more emphasis on Christ's humanity and free will, and the distinction of his two natures. Their view was that Jesus, the man (homo assumptus) to whom God the Word was conjoined, atoned for the sins of mankind through his perfect life and his sacrifice on the cross, after which God raised him up to heaven \"as a pledge of the salvation of all humanity\". In contrast, Alexandrian theologians such as Athanasius and Cyril of Alexandria had a \"Word-flesh\" Christology, or \"Christology from above\", which placed more emphasis on Christ's divinity and its absolute unity with his humanity. In their view, the Word became flesh, not merely by indwelling a man but through a hypostatic union. He then \"tasted death in the flesh\" on the cross and rose from the dead, thus saving humanity not by a moral example but by being incarnate for our sake, since \"what is not assumed is not saved\".\nAdditionally, the See of Rome's interpretation of its relationship to the other patriarchates (Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch) was increasingly diverging from their own. While the other patriarchates saw themselves as colleagues based on their autocephalous relationship to each other, the Popes of Rome believed that their position as \"first among equals\" and as the successors of Saint Peter gave them authority over the entire church.\n\nThese divisions came to a head in April 428, when Theodosius II appointed Nestorius, a monk from Antioch, to be the Patriarch of Constantinople. Nestorius immediately outraged the population by preaching against the use of the title Theotokos (Mother of God) for the Virgin Mary, arguing that Mary only gave birth to Christ's humanity, not his divinity. This was despite the title having a large role in popular piety, and having been used by previous theologians such as Athanasius, the Cappadocian Fathers, John Chrysostom, and even (with reservations) by Nestorius' own teacher Theodore of Mopsuestia. Nestorius' main opponent was Cyril, the Patriarch of Alexandria, who wrote him three letters. In the second letter, written in February 430, Cyril criticised Nestorius' theology, arguing that the Word was not united to a man \"merely as a result of will or good pleasure\", but \"became flesh\" as is written in John 1:14, and therefore the Virgin who bore the Word in his human nature can rightly be called the Theotokos. Cyril was more aggressive in his third letter to Nestorius, which further defined his theology and ended with 12 prepositions Cyril called on Nestorius to anathematize.\n\nInstead of cornering Nestorius, Cyril's third letter brought his own orthodoxy into question. Theodoret of Cyrrhus and Andrew of Samosata wrote rebuttals of Cyril's 12 anathemas, to which he responded with counter-rebuttals. Both Cyril and Nestorius wrote to Pope Celestine I of Rome for support, but he sided with Cyril. To settle the dispute, Theodosius II convened the Council of Ephesus. On 22 June 431, the council condemned Nestorius as \"the new Judas\" and deposed him. However, the dispute was not over, as John of Antioch arrived 4 days later with a group of Syrian bishops, only to find the council already finished and Nestorius condemned. He then excommunicated Cyril and everyone who had agree",

    "title": "Leo Kestenberg",
    "content": "Leo Kestenberg (27 November 1882 – 13 January 1962) was a German-Israeli classical pianist, music educator, and cultural politician. Working for the government in Prussia from 1918, he began a large-scale reform of music education (Kestenberg-Reform) which aimed to teach music to all, beginning with small children, and including the education of their teachers. In exile in Prague, he was instrumental in forming the and administrating the first international organization for music education, which became ISME. He fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and later moved to Mandatory Palestine, where he founded a seminary for music teachers and privately taught pianists such as Menahem Pressler and Alexis Weissenberg.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and education ===\nKestenberg was born the son of a Hungarian–Jewish hazzan in Ružomberok, then in the Kingdom of Hungary under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy. When he was four years old, the family moved to Prague and from there to Liberec two years later. Kestenberg received his first piano lessons from his father, then in 1894/95 from music director Gustav Albrecht in Zittau. After graduating from the Progymnasium, Kestenberg completed his schooling with the Mittlere Reife. At the age of 15, he began to study piano in Berlin with Franz Kullak. In 1898 he met Ferruccio Busoni, which led to an intimate friendship with him and his family, regarded as a turning point in his artistic life. After piano studies with José Vianna da Motta, Hermann Scholtz and Felix Draeseke, Kestenberg attended a master class by Busoni in Weimar in 1900 which introduced him to music by Bach, Schumann and above all Liszt. He joined the military band in Josefstadt the same year and began his concert career in Reichenberg as soloist in Liszt's First Piano Concerto. He became musical adviser to the Volksbühne Berlin, and a piano teacher at both the Stern Conservatory and the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory. He began serving on the educational committee of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which he had joined in 1900, publishing in the Sozialistische Monatshefte.\n\n\n=== Berlin ===\n\nIn January 1906, Kestenberg gave his first piano recital in Berlin and became a sought-after and celebrated Liszt interpreter.\nIn 1908, he married Grete Kussel; they had two daughters. He began his professional career as a concert pianist, which led to professorship in piano at the Musikhochschule Berlin from 1921 to 1929. He continued his cultural-political commitment, organising numerous artistic events within the framework of the USPD's workers' associations and trade unions in the Freie Volksbühne Berlin and the Workers' Singers' Association, in an effort to democratising the arts. He was involved in the popular education project of the Kroll Opera from 1927 to 1930, in Paul Cassirer's art magazine Der Bildermann in 1916, and supported the Commission for Exemplary Workers' Furniture in 1912.\nIn 1918, Kestenberg joined the Prussian Ministry of Culture as a research assistant, was appointed advisor to the art department in 1920 and headed the music department of the Zentralinstitut für Erziehung und Unterricht (Central Institute for Education and Instruction). Here he not only supported the modernisation and professionalisation of school music education, but also directed the entire Prussian appointment policy for the Berlin theatres and orchestras. In his paper Musikerziehung und Musikpflege (1921), he established for the first time an overall educational plan from kindergarten to university, and for the popular cultivation of music, which then formed the basis for the \"Denkschrift über die gesamte Musikpflege in Schule und Volk\" (1923) requested by the Prussian parliament. With the support of the non-party Minister of Culture Carl Heinrich Becker, he was able to implement essential educational policy reforms in Prussia (Kestenberg-Reform). The reform was gradually implemented in the form of decrees. In 1929 he was appointed a Ministerial Councilor. However, only a few days after his 50th birthday, Kestenberg was dismissed from all positions for political reasons on 1 December 1932.\n\n\n==== Kestenberg decrees ====\nPrüfung, Ausbildung und Anstellung der Musiklehrer an den höheren Lehranstalten in Preußen (Examination, training and employment of music teachers at the higher educational institutions in Prussia)\nPrivatunterricht in der Musik (Private lessons in music)\nSchulmusikunterricht in Preußen (School music lessons in Prussia)\n\n\n=== Prague ===\nImmediately after the seizure of power by the Nazis, Kestenberg first emigrated to Prague in 1933, where he was able to reactivate his Czechoslovak citizenship. He soon established contacts with the foreign minister Kamil Krofta and with German émigré circles (Oskar Kokoschka, Willy Haas, Ernst Bloch, Golo Mann) and the Prague born Max Brod.

    "content": "\"Snakehead\" is the ninth episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode followed the Fringe team's investigation into horrible deaths caused by large parasitic worms erupting from their victims' mouths. The case soon leads them to a Chinese gang and a black market of immunodeficiency medicinal drugs.\nCo-executive producer David Wilcox wrote the episode, while Paul Holahan served as its director. Andrew Orloff, the episode's visual effects supervisor, strived to makes the parasitic worms look as real as possible with the help of the actors and camera angles. It featured one-time guest stars Tzi Ma, Colby Paul, Ingrid Torrance and Jack Yang.\n\"Snakehead\" first aired on December 3, 2009, to an estimated 6.94 million viewers in the United States. Reviews of the episode were generally negative, as multiple critics expressed their dissatisfaction that little was learned about the series' overall mythology.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Dorchester, a damaged cargo ship from China washes ashore; all of the crew members seem to be infected with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate in the presence of a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better.\nThe Fringe team discovers a Triad gang member and ties to several shell companies the gang has set up in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but she seems unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him to be able to go outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins.\nMeanwhile, an invigorated Walter ventures out to Chinatown to find a herbalist for his research; unaware of the clerk's connection to the case, Walter casually mentions the giant worms. Walter manages to lose Astrid (Jasika Nicole), who was sent to follow him out of worry for his ability to travel alone. She goes back to the lab, but is attacked by Triad gang members intent on getting back the remaining worms. Unaware of this, a distraught Walter becomes lost and wastes all his bus money on wrong phone numbers, causing Peter to have to pick him up. Olivia talks to Jarvis, who finally admits to being aware of the medicine. She tells Olivia the whereabouts of the incoming ship, but they find it already empty. Peter and Walter return to the herbalist shop and discover the remaining passengers. The FBI storms in and the survivors are sent to the hospital for care. Feeling remorseful about the trouble he caused, Walter injects himself with a tracking implant and gives Peter the transponder.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\"Snakehead\" was written by co-executive producer David Wilcox, who had also written the season's third episode, \"Fracture\". The episode gave television director Paul Holahan his first directional credit for the series. The episode featured one-time guest appearances by actors Tzi Ma as Ming Che, Colby Paul as Matt Jarvis, Ingrid Torrance as Elizabeth Jarvis, and Jack Yang as Tao Chen.\nThe episode's visual effects supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios tried to make the parasitic worms look as real as possible. He explained, \"...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest.\" Orloff continued, \"And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also t",

Originally founded as a subsidiary of Prentice-Hall, Hawthorn Books went out of business after its publishing assets were acquired by E. P. Dutton.\n\n\n== A Catholic Publishing House is Founded ==\nHawthorn Books was founded in 1952 as a subsidiary of Prentice-Hall by Kenneth S. Giniger, editor in chief Prentice‐Hall's Trade Book Division. With its offices located at 70 Fifth Ave, New York, Hawthorn Books became a leading publisher of Catholic books including such works as the 150‐volume Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Catholicism.  The firm announced its plan to publish the English language version of the 150 volume encyclopedia in early 1958, after 40 volumes had already been published in France.\nThen on April 11, 1958, Hawthorn Books presented to Pope Pius XII the first copy of the St. Peter's edition of a Catholic Bible that also included commentary from Rev. R. Byson; this book was a leather-bound edition, limited to 3000 copies, of a large folio format Bible.  The Pope was so impressed with this new edition of the Bible that he wrote a note in which he stated that, \"We warmly welcome this new edition of a Family Bible\" for English-speaking Roman Catholics.\nThe company rapidly expanded its catalog and published a total of 73 various titles in 1963 alone. While under the leadership of Kenneth Giniger, it was his intention to have Hawthorn Books publish non-fiction books \"of lasting value.\"\n\n\n== A New Direction ==\nHowever, some time prior to December 1964, Mr. Giniger resigned as President and a director of Hawthorn Books. He was planning to establishing a new publishing company and was looking to possibly buy an English publishing house. After Giniger had resigned from the firm, Prentice‐Hall sold its subsidiary to Fred Kerner, a former editor of Hawthorn Books and later executive editor of Fawcett Publications. The purchase price was reported to be $1.5 million. At the time of the sale to Mr. Kerner, Gerald MacGregor continued to stay on with the firm as Vice President and General Manager.\nThen, in 1965, W. Clement Stone, an influential business man, philanthropist and self-help writer, became Chairman of the Board of Hawthorn Books. Stone intended to use the publishing company as a vehicle to supplement his magazine Success Unlimited.\n\n\n== The End of an Era And a New Beginning for the Company ==\nIn 1967 Hawthorn Books was sold to the Clement Stone interests, and again sold in 1977 to W. H. Allen. Hawthorn Books finally closed in 1977, but its publishing assets were bought by E. P. Dutton. The company was eventually bought and re-branded into Hawthorn Publishers in 2019, marking a new chapter while continuing its legacy in publishing. Our work at Hawthorn Publishers is built around our principles. We are dedicated to doing everything in the publication process to the highest standard. Our group thinks that each author's story is special and deserves to be treated with consideration and respect.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Tolberto III da Camino",
    "content": "Tolberto III da Camino (1263–1317) was an Italian nobleman and military leader, a member of the Da Camino family.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe son of Guecellone VI da Camino, he was allied with his cousin Gherardo III da Camino when the latter became lord of Treviso in 1283. In exchange, he received the castles of Oderzo, Camino and Motta di Livenza, which he maintained after some controversies rose a few years later. In 1286 he was podestà of Belluno, while five years later he led an unsuccessful plot against Gherardo together with his brother Biaquino VI and the bishop of Belluno. The two brothers asked protection to the doge of Venice Pietro Gradenigo: in exchange, they ceded Motta di Livenza to the Venetians, starting the Republic's expansion in the Veneto mainland.\nThe two later occupied some territories near Prodolone in the Patriarchate of Aquileia, for which they were excommunicated by the patriarch. The latter, namely Raimondo Della Torre, withdrew the excommunication in September 1293, following the establishment of an arbitral tribunal which ascertained the damage caused by the two to the Church of Aquileia. After fasting on bread and water, the brothers had to promise never to cross the Livenza again, the natural border line between the Camino territories and Friuli.\nIn his late life Tolberto reconciled  with  Gherardo, whose daughter Gaia he married to. In 1299 he became podestà of Treviso. After Gherardo's death and the succession of Rizzardo IV da Camino, he supported the latter's brother Guecellone VII (1312): however, a few months later he supported the plot which forced Guecellone to leave Treviso, effectively  ending the Da Camino's lordship in Treviso.\nIn 1317 he fought alongside the Trevigiani troops against Cangrande della Scala and the Count of Gorizia, but died suddenly in the same year.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAngella, Enrica; Pietro Bongi (1993).

    "title": "List of autoimmune diseases",
    "content": "This article provides a list of autoimmune diseases. These conditions, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells, affect a range of organs and systems within the body. Each disorder is listed with the primary organ or body part that it affects and the associated autoantibodies that are typically found in people diagnosed with the condition. Each disorder is also categorized by its acceptance as an autoimmune condition into four levels: confirmed, probable, possible, and uncertain. This classification is based on the current scientific consensus and reflects the level of evidence supporting the autoimmune nature of the disorder. Lastly, the prevalence rate, specifically in the United States, is included to give a sense of how common each disorder is within the population.\n\nConfirmed – Used for conditions that have strong, well-established evidence of autoimmune etiology.\nProbable – Used for conditions where there is substantial evidence of autoimmune involvement, but the scientific consensus may not be as strong as for those in the 'confirmed' category.\nPossible – Used for conditions that have some evidence pointing towards autoimmune involvement, but it's not yet clear or there is ongoing debate.\nUncertain – Used for conditions where the evidence of autoimmune involvement is limited or contested.\n\n\n== Integumentary system ==\nThe integumentary system, composed of the skin, hair, nails, and associated glands, serves as a protective barrier between the body and the environment. It also plays a critical role in regulating body temperature and maintaining fluid balance.\n\n\n== Digestive system ==\n\n\n== Heart and vascular system ==\n\n\n== Urinary system ==\n\n\n== Nervous system ==\n\n\n== Endocrine system ==\n\n\n== Respiratory system ==\n\n\n== Blood ==\n\n\n== Reproductive system ==\nThe reproductive system is responsible for the production and regulation of sex hormones, the formation of germ cells, and the nurturing of fertilized eggs. In women, it includes structures such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina, while in men, it includes testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate, and the penis. Autoimmune diseases of the reproductive system can affect both male and female fertility and reproductive health.\n\n\n== Eyes ==\n\n\n== Musculoskeletal system ==\nThese autoimmune diseases are primarily associated with the muscles, joints and neuromuscular function.\n\n\n== Autoimmune comorbidities ==\nThis list includes conditions that are not diseases, but symptoms or syndromes common to autoimmune disease.\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome\nComplex regional pain syndrome\nEosinophilic esophagitis\nGastritis\nPOEMS syndrome\nRaynaud's phenomenon\nPrimary immunodeficiency\nPyoderma gangrenosum\n\n\n== Non-autoimmune ==\nAt this time, there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the diseases in the following table are caused by autoimmunity. This section is included because some of these conditions are immune-related but frequently confused with autoimmune diseases. Others are conditions that have been historically speculated as autoimmune due to overlapping symptoms like inflammation, but have been reclassified or excluded based on current research.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutoimmunity\nAutoantibody\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNIH Center for Human Immunology, Inflammation, and Autoimmunity",

    "title": "2023 Johannesburg building fire",
    "content": "On 31 August 2023 at around 01:30 SAST, a fire engulfed an illegally occupied government-owned building in Johannesburg, South Africa; 77 people were killed and 88 others were injured. It was one of the deadliest fires in South African history.\n\n\n== The building ==\nThe building, 80 Albert Street, was built in 1954 as the head office of Johannesburg's Non-European Affairs Department, serving as a Pass Office for enforcing pass laws controlling the movement of black people into Johannesburg under the apartheid system. From 1994, the building housed a women's shelter later called the Usindiso Women's Shelter. In 2019, a clinic housed in the building was relocated by the member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Health and Social Development, Mpho Phalatse, as the building was occupied by squatters and found to be unsafe.\nThe building is marked with a heritage plaque narrating its history.\n\n\n== Fire ==\nThe fire broke out in the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2023, in the Central Business District, at a five-storey abandoned building on the corner of Delvers and Albert Streets that is owned by the city government and was taken over by gangs. It was being illegally occupied by as many as 400 impoverished people—many of them foreign nationals, economic migrants, and asylum seekers—all of whom were being charged rent by the gangs. The cause of the fire is not currently known. It spread through the building, trapping many people due to flimsy partitions and gates between makeshift rooms constructed by residents.\nMany residents jumped from the windows of the building to escape, some of whom did not survive the jump. Firefighters found bodies piled up where they had died at a locked gate on the ground floor while trying to exit the burning building.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe fire brought attention to the hundreds of hijacked buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, typically overcrowded and unregulated and inhabited by impoverished and marginalised people including a large number of undocumented migrants to South Africa's economic hub of Johannesburg.\nSome residents who survived the fire refused to board buses for relocation to emergency accommodation in community halls after the fire, fearing the relocation would be used by officials as an excuse for deportation, and being unwilling to leave behind the remains of their possessions in the burnt building.\nIn January 2024, a 29-year-old man was arrested after he confessed to starting the fire. The man said he started the fire in order to get rid of another murder victim's body on the orders of a Tanzanian drug dealer who also lived in the building. He is currently facing 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder. In September 2025, The man, who has since been identified as Sthembiso Mdlalose, said he was in the building but didn't start the fire. Later that same month, Mdlalose, who is now on trial, recanted his previous statement saying he was nowhere near the building when the fire occurred and was instead sleeping on the street.\n\n\n== Response ==\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa visited the site of the tragedy on 31 August, calling it a \"wake-up call\". Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi announced an inquiry into the fire. While government officials blamed the crisis on NGOs, who prevented the previous attempts to evict occupiers from similar properties, NGOs and inner city property owners argued that it was the duty of the City of Johannesburg to maintain buildings, provide services and enforce safety regulations. South Africa's courts have consistently ruled that evictions cannot proceed unless alternative housing is provided under the provisions of the 1998 Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act. Following the fire, the City attempted to disconnect illegal electricity connections from similar hijacked buildings in the city, but was met with strong resistance from residents.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n \n\n\n== See also ==\n2023 Hanoi building fire, another large residential fire two weeks later\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChutel, Lynsey; Gebrekidan, Selam; Eligon, John (10 November 2023). \"Deadly Fire in Africa's Richest City Exposed a Secret in Plain Sight\".

    "content": "Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe (born 1979 in Zabrze, Poland as Grzegorz Rossoliński) is a German–Polish historian based in Berlin, associated with the Friedrich Meinecke Institute of the Free University of Berlin. He specializes in the history of the Holocaust and East-Central Europe, fascism, nationalism, the history of antisemitism, the history of the Soviet Union, and the politics of memory.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRossoliński-Liebe studied cultural history and East European history at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder) from 1999 to 2005. He worked on his doctoral dissertation about Stepan Bandera and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists at the University of Alberta and the University of Hamburg from 2007, and defended his PhD at the University of Hamburg in June 2012. Between 2012 and 2014, he worked on a post-doctoral project at the Free University of Berlin on the Ukrainian diasporic memory of the Holocaust. He also worked as a research assistant at the Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and at the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies. He is the author of Stepan Bandera: The Life and Afterlife of a Ukrainian Nationalist. Fascism, Genocide, and Cult, a scholarly biography of Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, and an in-depth study of his political cult. From 2014 to 2018, Rossoliński-Liebe investigated the German-Polish collaboration in World War II. During this time, he was a Saul Kagan Fellow of the Claims Conference and a fellow of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah, the German Historical Institute Warsaw and the Yad Vashem International Institute for Holocaust Research.\n\n\n== Political reactions ==\nRossoliński-Liebe was invited in late February and early March 2012 by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, the German Academic Exchange Service, and the German embassy in Kyiv, to deliver six lectures about Bandera in three Ukrainian cities. The lectures were scheduled to take place in February and March 2012 in Lviv, Dnipro and Kyiv. The organizers, however, were unable to find a suitable venue in Lviv, and also, three of the four lectures in Dnipro and Kyiv were canceled a few hours prior to the event.\nThe only lecture took place in the German embassy in Kyiv, under the protection of police. In front of the building, approximately one hundred protesters, including members of the radical-right Svoboda party, tried to convince a few hundred interested students, scholars, and ordinary Ukrainians not to attend the presentation, claiming that Rossoliński-Liebe was \"Joseph Goebbels' grandchild\" and a \"liberal fascist from Berlin.\" In response to the harassment and threats made towards him during his lecture trip in Ukraine, the online petition \"For Freedom of Speech and Expression in Ukraine\" was signed by 97 persons, including scholar Delphine Bechtel.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Books and Papers ===\nPolnische Bürgermeister und der Holocaust.

With a background as sailor, journalist, constructor in the United States, engineer in Oslo, businessman and entrepreneur, he went bankrupt in 1922. From then on he initiated a criminal career, and made a living from liquor smuggling, swindle and theft, also spending long periods in prison.\nFollowing release from jail in 1935, Omre made his literary début with the novel Smuglere (Smugglers). The story is largely based on his own experiences, and is written in hardboiled style. Then came the follow-ups Flukten (1936), Sukkenes bro (1937) and Kristinus Bergmann (1938).\nHe was awarded Gyldendal's Endowment in 1938.\nIn 1939 he wrote the novel Intermesso, in 1940 Det onde øie, in 1941 Harmoni, and in 1942 Mysterium i Rolvsøy. He published several short story collections. Many of his short stories were first published in magazines, such as Arbeidermagasinet.

    "title": "Southside, Dublin",
    "content": "The Southside (Irish: Taobh Ó Dheas) is the part of Dublin city that lies south of the River Liffey. It is an informal but commonly used term. In comparison to the city's Northside, it has historically been regarded as wealthier and more privileged, with several notable exceptions. Malahide, one of the wealthiest areas in Ireland, is on the Northside, for example, whereas low-income districts such as Jobstown and Sallynoggin are part of the Southside. \n\n\n== Areas of the Southside ==\nThe Southside includes Dublin city centre south of the Liffey, including Grafton Street and other notable streets, and also inner city areas such as The Liberties / The Coombe and Temple Bar.\nBeyond the city centre, the Southside (in the geographical sense) includes the districts named here, most of the names being old, though many were until recent times rural townlands:\n\n\n== Postcodes ==\n\nTraditionally, Dublin postal districts on Southside begin with even numbers, while those of the Northside begin with odd numbers. College Green for example, is in the city's D02 district—simply called \"Dublin 2\" in everyday speech—whereas the outer suburb of Tallaght is in D24. One exception to this rule is the Phoenix Park, which forms part of the even-numbered district D08, but is actually on the Northside. Historian Pat Liddy explains this discrepancy: \"Long before there were postal codes, the James's Street Postal Sorting Office looked after the Phoenix Park, because it was considered to be closer and more convenient than Phibsborough. James's Street continued in this role when the postal codes were introduced, so Dublin 8 it had to be.\" \n\nThe outer edges of the Southside and substantial parts of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown contain those new \"A\" postcode areas that have been assigned to southern Dublin (some \"A\" areas are situated in County Wicklow and County Meath and others lie across the Liffey in northern Fingal). These are separate from the traditional postal districts but have been unified with them under the new Eircode system. Blackrock, for example, is in Dublin A94, whereas Dun Laoghaire is in the A96 area. Since Eircode was implemented, Southside postal addresses now take two general forms, depending on whether they lie within the traditional postal district area or not. This is an example of a postal address within the traditional Dublin postal districts:\nThe Shelbourne Hotel,\n27 St. Stephen's Green,\nDublin 2,\nD02 K224.\nAnd this is an example of a Southside postal address from outside the traditional postal districts:\n\nThe Mellow Fig,\n5A George's Avenue,\nBlackrock,\nCounty Dublin,\nA94 XK11.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDublin 4\nList of Eircode routing areas in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal",
    "content": "The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal is an expansion for the role-playing video game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks, released in November 2002. The first of two expansions released for Morrowind, Tribunal is set in Mournhold, the capital of the province of Morrowind, and a self-contained city disconnected from the original game. The central quests task the player to resolve the tensions between the King of Morrowind, Hlaalu Helseth, and the Living God Almalexia. The expansion includes quality of life additions, including alterations to the game's quest journal and map.\nDeveloped following the release of Morrowind, Tribunal was based on earlier concepts and settings in The Elder Scrolls series. The developers aimed to create a self-contained experience that explored the characters and mythology of the 'Living Gods' of the Tribunal, a key element of the narrative in the original game. Upon release, Tribunal received positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay improvements, greater difficulty, and setting, and criticism directed to the linear and short nature of the expansion and ongoing technical issues with the game. The reception of Tribunal influenced the game's second expansion, The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon, released in 2003.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nGameplay in Tribunal is identical to Morrowind, with the game functioning as an extension of quests and open-ended locations to explore. The main addition to Tribunal is the inclusion of a city, Mournhold. Mournhold is not a contiguous part of the game world in Morrowind, and players are required to access the area through a teleportation service, with certain features such as levitation disabled to conceal the city's separation from the game world. Access to the content in Tribunal is possible after the player first goes to sleep, which will trigger the initial quest leading the player to a service that can teleport them to Mournhold.\nTribunal features several minor quality of life gameplay additions, including the modification of the game's quest journal system. In the original game, the journal records entries in linear chronological order, which can become lengthy and cumbersome as the game progresses. Tribunal introduces changes to the journal interface allowing a player to sort their journal by quest name and distinguish between active and completed quests. Other interface additions include the ability to annotate the game's map. The expansion introduces hireable followers who can travel with the player. This includes a mercenary who can use weapons and armor provided by the player, so long as they are paid a regular fee. The player can hire a pack rat who can carry items from the player's inventory. In addition, the Museum of Artifacts provides the player with an avenue to sell high-value items obtained in the original game.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player is attacked by an assassin, later revealed to be a member of the Dark Brotherhood, an assassins' guild. To find out more about the Dark Brotherhood, the player is directed to Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind. Upon arrival, the player locates and defeats the head of the Dark Brotherhood, and complete a series of side quests for the new King Helseth and the Living God Almalexia. Almalexia has ruled Morrowind for thousands of years alongside her fellow gods Vivec and Sotha Sil, who call themselves the Tribunal, and are worshipped by the Dark Elves. During the player's visit to Mournhold, a group of mechanical creatures called Fabricants attack the Plaza Brindisi Dorom area. The creatures emerge from the statue in the middle of the plaza, revealing a secret passageway to a Dwemer ruin. Since the creatures are mechanical, it is suspected that the secretive god Sotha Sil is behind this attack. The player investigates the ruins and completes further quests in order to reconstruct Nerevar's lost sword called Trueflame. Upon acquiring the sword, the player is sent to the Clockwork City in order to kill Sotha Sil.\nThe player explores Clockwork City, finally arriving to find Sotha Sil dead. Upon leaving, Almalexia appears and alleges that she had killed Sotha Sil and instigated the attack in Mournhold, in order to gain more power and control over the citizens and the Tribunal. Driven mad by the Heart of Lorkhan, Almalexia perceived Sotha Sil's silence as mockery. The player is then forced to kill her before returning to Mournhold. As the player exits Almalexia's temple in Mournhold, the Daedric Prince Azura reveals that the Heart of Lorkhan drove Almalexia mad and made her hunger for more power, and that mere mortals cannot become gods without consequences. By destroying the Heart of Lorkhan and killing Almalexia, the player continues fulfilling the Nerevarine prophecies, particularly the death of the Almsivi Tribunal.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe plot and setting of Tribunal was conceived during earlier development in earlier Elder Scrolls titles. Mournhold, the setting of Tribunal, featured as a loca",

    "title": "Pratt & Whitney PW1120",
    "content": "The Pratt & Whitney PW1120 turbojet is a derivative of the F100 turbofan. It was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe development of the PW1120, according to Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) specifications, started in June 1980. It retained the F100 core module, gearbox, fuel pump, forward ducts, as well as the F100 digital electronic control, with only minor modifications. Unique PW1120 components included a wide chord low pressure (LP) compressor, single-stage uncooled low pressure (LP) turbine, simplified single stream augmentor, and a lightweight convergent/divergent nozzle. Full scale testing was initiated in June 1982, and flight clearance of the PW1120 was tested in August 1984. The PW1120 had 70 percent similarity with the F100, so the IDF/AF would not need a special facility for spare parts. It would be built under licence by Bet-Shemesh Engines Limited in Israel.\nIAI installed one PW1120 in the starboard nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDF/AF (Number 334/66-0327) to explore the airframe/powerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as Kurnass 2000 (\"Heavy Hammer\") or Super Phantom and to act as an engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant bay doors, new airframe mounted gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic throttle system. It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant control/airframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986.\nTwo PW1120 powerplants were installed in the same F-4E and it was flown for the first time on 24 April 1987. This proved very successful, allowing the Kurnass 2000 to exceed Mach 1 without the afterburners, and endowing a combat thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.04 (17 per cent better than the F-4E). This improved the sustained turn rate by 15 per cent, the climb rate by 36 per cent, medium-level acceleration by 27 per cent and low-level speed with 18 bombs from 1,046 km/h to 1,120 km/h (654 - 700 mph or 565 kn to 605 kn).

    "content": "The California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) is a nonprofit research and technology commercialization institute affiliated with three University of California campuses in the San Francisco Bay Area: Berkeley, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz. QB3's domain is the quantitative biosciences: areas of biology in which advances are chiefly made by scientists applying techniques from physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science.\n\n\n== History ==\nQB3 was founded in 2000 as one of four Governor Gray Davis Institutes for Science and Innovation (originally, California Institutes for Science and Innovation, or Cal ISIs). From a 2005 article written for the University of California Academic Senate:\n\nThe Institutes were launched in 2000 as an ambitious statewide initiative to support research in fields that were recognized as critical to the economic growth of the state—biomedicine, bioengineering, nanosystems, telecommunications and information technology. Moreover, the Cal ISIs were conceived as a catalytic partnership between university research interests and private industry that could expand the state economy into new industries and markets and \"speed the movement of innovation from the laboratory into peoples' daily lives\" (Governor's Budget summary 2001-02). The four research centers operate as a partnership among the University, state government, and industry, and each involves structured collaborations among campuses, disciplines, academics researchers, research professional, and students.\n\n\n== Campus sites ==\nThe tri-campus organization includes three research branches: QB3-Berkeley, QB3-Santa Cruz, and the Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI-UCSF) at the San Francisco campus.\n\nQB3-Berkeley: The Berkeley branch of QB3 is housed in Stanley Hall along with the Department of Bioengineering, but core research facilities are situated throughout campus, including the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Lab at Weill Hall. The Bakar BioEngineering Hub at Woo Hon Fai Hall houses Bakar Labs, a core incubator of QB3.\nQB3-Santa Cruz: At the Santa Cruz campus, QB3 forms part of the Genomics Institute and is headquartered in the Westside Research Park. The space was formerly owned by Texas Instruments as a semiconductor wafer fabrication plant. The facilities include a total of approximately 242,000 gross (154,000 net) square feet, including a large \"clean room,\" a specially designed supercomputer center, and extensive space used for classrooms, laboratories, and offices.\nQBI-UCSF: QBI is situated in Byers Hall on the Mission Bay campus. Byers Hall, officially opened in 2005, also hosts the QB3 director's office and QB3 central administration. Many faculty labs are in Genentech Hall, an adjoining building.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nQB3 is directed by David Schaffer, a Berkeley professor with appointments in multiple departments who also directs the Bakar BioEnginuity Hub and its associated incubator, Bakar Labs. Each participating campus has a QB3 director who also is an active research scientist: Sanjay Kumar at Berkeley, Nevan Krogan at UCSF, and Ed Green at UC Santa Cruz.\n\n\n== Faculty affiliates ==\nResearch faculty affiliates are the foundation of QB3. QB3 has more than 250 faculty affiliates, roughly 100 each from Berkeley, UCSF, and UC Santa Cruz. The research interests of these faculty fall under the umbrella of the quantitative biosciences. QB3 scientists tend to be bioengineers, biophysicists, or pharmaceutical or computational biologists. Synthetic biology is strongly represented. Current and former members of QB3 include Shuvo Roy, Elizabeth Blackburn, Steven Chu, Joseph DeRisi, Jennifer Doudna, David Haussler, Jay Keasling, Arun Majumdar, Harry Noller.\n\n\n=== Research ===\nQB3 member scientists choose affiliations with one of nine research themes:\n\nBiological imaging – visualizing biological systems at all scales: atoms, cells, organs\nBiomaterials and stem cells – Development of biomaterials and stem cells for biotechnology and therapeutic applications\nBiomolecular structure and mechanism – structure, function and dynamics of macromolecules\nCellular dynamics – biochemical and biophysical analysis of cellular processes; visualizing biological systems at all scales: atoms, cells, organs\nChemical biology – applying the tools of chemistry to biology, aiding in drug discovery and interrogation of biology\nGenotype to phenotype – harvesting the information in genomes and the effect of variation\nPrecision measurement and control of biological systems – developing the ability to mechanically, optically or chemically alter and monitor biology for interrogation and diagnostics\nSynthetic biology – design, redesign and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems\nTheoretical modeling of biological systems – theoretical and computational analysis of macromolecules, biological systems, and interpretation of experimental data\n\n\n== Activities ==\nA major function of QB3 is to make connections between ",

He has been a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions.\n\n\n== Early life, career, and family ==\nMarler was born in Montreal, Quebec. After graduating from Malvern College in England, Marler received a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature from Bishop's University (1962) and a Bachelor of Laws degree from McGill University (1965). He has published articles on maritime law, served as city councillor in Lac-Tremblant-Nord (1970–72), and been a director of the Brome Lake Chamber of Commerce. He is member of the United Church of Canada. Since 1995, was Senior & Managing Partner at the law firm of Marler & Associates.\nMarler's family has been active in politics and government for many decades. He is the grandson of Herbert Meredith Marler, who served as a cabinet minister in the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King, and a grand-nephew of George Carlyle Marler, who was a cabinet minister in the governments of Louis St. Laurent and Jean Lesage.\n\n\n== Federal politics ==\nMarler moved to Brome—Missisquoi in 2003 and ran for the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, after defeating Jacques Dalton for the nomination. He highlighted his support for provincial rights within the Canadian constitution and actively supported his party's promise for more free votes in the House of Commons of Canada. Marler's campaign manager described him as \"the least conservative of Conservative candidates.\" He finished third against Bloc Québécois candidate Christian Ouellet.\nIn December 2006, Marler was appointed as a commissioner on the Eastern Townships School Board to replace an incumbent who had resigned. He did not seek re-election in late 2007.\nMarler left the Conservative Party in January 2008. He has said that he refused to accept thirty thousand dollars via the party's controversial \"in-and-out\" transfer scheme during the 2006 election, and that party officials later informed him they did not want him as a candidate in 2008. The Conservative Party rejected the accusation. (Under the \"in-and-out\" scheme, the Conservatives transferred national campaign money into individual ridings and before transferring it out again to pay for national advertising. In this way, the party was able to avoid national spending limits. Marler has said that he refused the transfer because he did not know what the money was for and could not get a clear explanation from party officials.)\nIn the 2008 election, Marler published a piece entitled, \"Sixty-Six Said Yes; a Personal Account of a Campaign and a Scandal,\" covering his involvement with the Conservative Party. He ran as an independent, saying that a Conservative majority government would be dangerous for Canadian democracy.\nMarler died on January 2, 2025 in Thunder Bay, Ontario. \n\n\n== Electoral record ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Dixie Mafia",
    "content": "The Dixie Mafia, or the Dixie Mob,  originally referred to a loosely connected criminal organization that was based in Biloxi, Mississippi and which operated primarily throughout the Southern United States from the 1960s to the 1980s. It engaged in burglary, theft, robbery and fencing. Their activities eventually expanded into the illegal trade in tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and methamphetamine, as well as contract killings and blackmail. Some of the more well known members were Mike Gillich, Todd Anthony and Kirksey Nix.\nIt is now a general term for independent gangs and criminal networks composed of White Southerners who engage in a variety of criminal activities, from drug dealing, pimping, gambling, robberies and burglaries to contract killings.\n\n\n== Early days ==\nBeginning in the 1960s, the Dixie Mafia began working as a loosely knit group of traveling criminals performing residential burglary, robbery, and theft. The gang did not function with a set chain of command, with the concept that whoever made the most money deserved to be boss. Despite the informal structure, the Dixie Mafia had one rule that members were expected to obey: \"Thou shall not snitch to the cops\".\nUnlike members of the American Mafia, the members of the Dixie mafia were not connected by family or country of origin. They were loosely connected individuals of many nationalities with a common goal—to make money and wield control over illegal moneymaking operations by any means, including influence peddling, bribery of public officials, and murder.\nThe gang became known for carrying out contract killings, particularly against former members. During its peak, from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, dozens of people were murdered (usually shot) by its members. Victims were most often murdered because they testified, or threatened to testify, against fellow members.\n\"The Strip\" in Biloxi, Mississippi, was home base for the Dixie Mafia, and Mike Gillich, Jr., was the group's unofficial but de facto kingpin. Of Croatian descent and from a large, poor family, he had raised himself in the city's Point Cadet section to become a wealthy entrepreneur along \"The Strip\". He owned a string of motels and nightclubs that doubled as strip joints and gambling dens, as well as a bingo parlor. He was known and trusted by almost every member of the Dixie Mafia, especially those who trusted no one else. In the words of one investigator of the Sherry murders, \"Mr. Mike runs the criminals' post office. He's their banker.\"\nGillich was also patron and protector of Kirksey McCord Nix Jr., one of the gang's most notable members. In December 1965, at the age of 22, Nix was caught carrying illegal automatic weapons in Fort Smith, Arkansas. An old friend of his, Juanda Jones, ran a bordello there, and Nix became involved with Jones' adolescent daughter, Sheri LaRa. In later years, she played a key role in his operations, including direct ties to the murders of Vince and Margaret Sherry. Edward Humes, in his 1994 book, Mississippi Mud, chronicled their murders and the subsequent investigation of Gillich, Nix, Bobby Fabian, and others who were involved either loosely or actively in the murders. With the aid of his father's connections in neighboring Oklahoma, Nix beat the weapons charges in Fort Smith and moved on to other crimes. He was suspected in the gangland-style murder of a gambler named Harry Bennett, who was about to turn state's evidence against several Dixie Mafia members. Although Nix's involvement in Bennett's murder was never proven, this incident precipitated a string of killings that left 25 people dead in six states over the next four years.\nNix was a suspect in the attempted assassination of McNairy County, Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, and in the murder of Pusser's wife. Nix was also convicted of murdering wealthy New Orleans grocery owner Frank Corso. At the time of the murder, Nix was believed to be employed by Darrel Ward in Clarksville, Texas. Ward was a noted associate of Chicago Mob boss Sam Giancana, and is thought to have controlled organized crime and bootlegging throughout Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The Dixie Mafia was strongly connected to the State Line Mob and its leader, Carl Douglas White.\n\n\n== Dixie Mafia's locales ==\nThe Dixie Mafia's origins were in the Appalachian states, which had a regionalism dating back to the Whiskey Rebellion and the secessionist movement resulting, briefly, in the state of Franklin (Eastern Tennessee). This view that the federal government is oppressive and that criminal enterprise against it is justified spread from its place of origin to wealthier regions where the Dixie Mafia operated; primarily in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, particularly around the cities of Birmingham, Baton Rouge, Hattiesburg, Corinth, Dallas, and Atlanta. Some of the group's criminal activities were in more obscure parts of their major areas of operation, making the group and ",

    "content": "The Third Chimpanzee is the fourth solo recording by Martin Gore, the primary songwriter for the band Depeche Mode. The tracks were recorded in Santa Barbara in Gore's home studio and released 29 January 2021 by Mute. It was his first solo release in six years.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis is Gore's first solo release since Depeche Mode's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The record consists of five instrumental tracks with no vocal parts named after different primate species. The EP title refers to the Jared Diamond’s 1991 book of the same name, in which Diamond, an evolutionary biologist and popular-science author, discusses the origins of human behaviour by showing the similarities between human behaviour and that of primates. The album cover was performed by a capuchin monkey.\nIn the statement Gore explained: \"The first track I recorded had a sound that wasn't human. It sounded primate-like. I decided to name it 'Howler', after a monkey. Then, when it came time to name the EP, I remembered reading the book The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee. It all made sense to call it that, as the EP was made by one of the third chimpanzees.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, The Third Chimpanzee received an average score of 69, based on six reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nPaul Simpson of AllMusic commented, \"Like all of Gore's solo releases, The Third Chimpanzee unmistakably feels like a side project. It's intriguing to hear what sounds and moods he can create outside of the context of his band, but even compared to the more fully realized MG, the EP merely sounds tentative. However, it's worth noting that the striking cover art was painted by Pockets Warhol, a capuchin monkey, which is fascinating.\" Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of Paste Magazine stated, \"On his new EP The Third Chimpanzee, Gore once again reaches for his usual trademarks: the clanging of synthetic marimba-like textures..., siren wails that conjure images of sentient machines crying out in torment..., throbbing bass interlaced with ticking beats... Absent are the pinging synth arpeggios that mimic nylon guitar strings. (Or is it vice-versa?) Either way, Gore does splash the tracks with some typically spartan electric guitar flourishes. Longtime followers of Gore’s work, though, might find themselves thinking they’ve heard all of this before—many times. They wouldn’t be wrong.\" Robert Ham of Pitchfork Media observed, \"The Third Chimpanzee is his darkest—and strongest—solo work yet. The five instrumentals, all of them named after different primates, have the overdriven sting of vintage industrial, with bone-shuddering bass and the nastiest synth eruptions that he has elicited since Depeche Mode's 1997 album Ultra. The mood is feral and erotic yet curiously comfortable, as if Gore discovered his old bondage gear in the back of a closet and found that it still fits.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

She took part to the Des Papous dans la tête radiko program on France Culture. In 1993 she won the Prix Roger Nimier for C'était le paradis and the Prix du jury Jean-Giono For her autobiographical narration Les Caresses et les Baisers (1998). Les Malgré-nous (2003), which recounts the first Nazi raids in Alsace during the Second World War, obtained a great public success. In \"Désormais Venise\" (2005), Dominique Muller evokes her passionate love affairs with Maurice Rheims.\nIn 1999, she launched into the historical detective novel genre with a series whose hero is the doctor Florent Bonnevy, nicknamed Sauve-du-Mal, whose investigations take place under the Régence of Philippe, duc d'Orléans. A rationalist and follower of the ideas advocated by the Encyclopédistes, doctor Florent leaves his native Holland to settle in France. Having become a familiar of the Régent, who does not always trust him, he must hide his Jewish origins from his wife Justine. In Sauve-du-Mal et les tricheurs (1999), he investigates the past of a friend of Justine found dead in a maison close. In Le Culte des dupes (2000), he is the target of a sect worshiping the Egyptian gods who, under this cover, is trafficking young girls in a convent. Very well documented, the series Sauve-du-Mal observes a style in the manner of the writers of the eighteenth century.\nIn 1989, she was awarded the Prix Mottard of the Académie française for her novel Danger public.\nMuller lives in Venice and Paris and now signs her works Dominique Muller-Wakhevitch.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== novels ===\n\n\n==== Detective series Sauve-du-Mal ====\n1999: Sauve-du-Mal et les tricheurs, Paris, 10/18, series \"Grands Détectives\", No. 3074,ISBN 2264027452.\n1999: Le Culte des dupes, 10/18, 1999, series \"Grands Détectives\", No. 3075, ISBN 2264027460.\n2000: Trop de cabales pour Sauve-du-Mal, 10/18, series \"Grands Détectives\", No. 3161, ISBN 2264027479.\n2001: Sauve-du-Mal et l'appât du grain, 10/18, series \"Grands Détectives\", No. 3291, ISBN 2264031646.\n2001: Sauve-du-Mal dans l'ombre du tsar, 10/18, series \"Grands Détectives\", No. 3350, ISBN 2264031646.\n\n\n==== Other novels ====\n1986: Brave Petite, Paris, Le Seuil, ISBN 9782020092166.\n1988: Danger public, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020102889, Prix Mottard of the Académie française\n1993: C'était le paradis, Le Seuil, ISBN 9782020177412, Prix Roger-Nimier.\n1995: Le Meilleur de la vie, Fayard, ISBN 2213594767.\n2000: Les Filles prodigues, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020417855.\n2001: Les Chapeaux de roues, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020516918.\n2003: Les Malgré-nous, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020613360.\n2006: Aimer sans bagages, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020862603.\n2008: Lire la notice et vivre ensuite, Stock, ISBN 2234061393.\n2010: Laguna nostra, Robert Laffont, ISBN 2221105397.\n\n\n=== Autobiographical stories ===\n1998: Les Caresses et les Baisers, Paris, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020344033.\n2005: Désormais Venise, Paris, Le Seuil, ISBN 2020685833.\n\n\n=== Biographies ===\n1990: Une traînée de poudre: Jeanne Du Barry, la dernière favorite, Paris, JC Lattès.\n1996: Une reine pas très catholique, biographie d'Anne Boleyn, Paris, NiL Éditions, ISBN 9782290049112\n\n\n=== Essay ===\n1998: Demander la lune, Paris, Nil; reprint, Paris, Le Seuil, 1999, series \"Points\", No. 688, ISBN 2020352966.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nClaude Mesplède [in French] (2007).

    "content": "Gunter Silva (born 1977) is a Peruvian writer.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGunter Silva Passuni was born in 1977 in La Merced, Peru. He studied Law at the Catholic University of Santa María in Arequipa. He also holds an MA in Literature and Creative Writing awarded by the University of Westminster. \n\n\n== Career ==\nHe published his first short stories collection, Crónicas de Londres (The London Chronicles) in 2012, and in 2016 his second book Pasos Pesados (Steps Through Fire), a novel about a young protagonist called Tiago E. Molina and his turbulent life in Peru during the armed conflict, the setting is the city of Lima at the end of the 80's and the beginning of the 90's. Carlos Fonseca Suárez describes the novel as \"the epic of another lost generation that matures in the midst of a ruined and violent homeland\". The book was warmly received by the critics, and in 2017 it won a grant from the Danish Arts Foundation, and was translated into Danish as Tiagos overdrevne og vildfarne eventyr.\nNeutrino, Cuaderno de Navegación (Neutrino, A Navigator's Logbook), the author’s first exploration of non-fiction, was launched at the Lima International Book Fair in July 2024. Seamlessly combining diary and essay, it explores themes such as the author’s illness, death, and existence, transforming everyday moments and details into profound meditations on human fragility, nostalgia, and uncertainty. The literary magazine Culturamas says about the book: “Neutrino opts for a sober, intimate, and cerebral way of portraying fragility. Its aesthetic approach is an ethical one: facing what hurts head-on, but without embellishment or melodrama.”\n\nHe has been invited, among others, to the London Book Fair, Ricardo Palma International Book Fair, Guadalajara, Festival Literatura Copenhagen, and to the First International Conference of Contemporary Peruvian Writers \"Palabras Fuera de Lugar\" at Milan in 2017, organised by the Peruvian Consulate and the University of Milan.\nHis short story Herford, won the World Literature Today Translation Prize in 2019.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n’'Crónicas de Londres.

    "title": "Brooke Claxton",
    "content": "Brian Brooke Claxton  (23 August 1898 – 13 June 1960) was a Canadian veteran of World War I, federal Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of National Defence.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in Montreal and received his early education at Lower Canada College. He was a gifted student and entered McGill University in September 1915 after completing grade 11. While at McGill he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. After a year at university he left McGill in 1916 and enlisted with the Victoria Rifles of Canada.\n\n\n== Professional career and achievements ==\nHe served overseas with the Royal Canadian Field Artillery on the Western Front, and saw action, which experience marked him profoundly. He was promoted to the rank of Battery Sergeant-Major in the field and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\nReturning to Canada after the War, Claxton completed his course at McGill, graduating with honours in Law. He practised his profession in Montreal. In 1939 he was created a King's Counsel. He had an academic post at McGill where he was associate professor of commercial law until 1944.\nClaxton was active in community service. He served as President of the Canadian Club of Montreal, Chairman of the Montreal branch of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, chairman of the Board of Governors of Lower Canada College from 1925 until 1934, and was a graduate fellow of the Corporation of McGill University. The burgeoning nationalism after World War I led Claxton to become involved in associations such as the Canadian League and the League of Nations Society. He was also an intervenor on behalf of the federal government in the constitutional issue concerning jurisdiction over radio broadcasting. He was active in laying the foundations for the establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n \n\nHis political career began in the general election of 1940 when he was first elected to the House of Commons as Liberal Member for the constituency of St. Lawrence-St. George, Montreal. He was re-elected in 1945 and again in 1949. He was appointed in 1943 as Parliamentary Assistant to the Prime Minister. He served in the federal Liberal cabinets of Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. In 1944 he was named the first Minister of the newly created Department of National Health and Welfare (1944–46). He was responsible for the organization of the department and implementation of the administration system for the universal Family Allowances social welfare scheme. In 1946 Claxton became Minister of National Defence in which portfolio he served until 1954.\nIn 1947 he headed the Canadian delegation to the British Commonwealth Conference on Japan held in Australia. As vice-chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Newfoundland, in 1949 he signed the terms of union on behalf of Canada. He represented Canada at the meetings of the Defence Committee under the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., Paris and The Hague. As Minister of National Defence he guided post-war demobilization, helped shape Canadian Cold War foreign policy, and presided over Canada's participation in the Korean War. \nIn 1947, Claxton reopened RMC as a 3-service cadet college offering a 4-year academic degree. He said, \"The role of the officer in modern war can only be properly discharged if they have education and standing in the community comparable to that of any of the other professions as well as high qualities of character and physique.\"\nIn 1949 he appointed Rear-Admiral Rollo Mainguy to head a commission of inquiry into the so-called \"mutinees\" on several navy ships that year. The Mainguy Report found no sign of Communist subversion, and noted that the sailors involved had some justified grievances.\n\n\n== Family ==\nClaxton's brother-in-law was Second Lieutenant Donaldson Lizars Savage who died on 15 November 1916 at the age of 20. Savage was killed in action in Somme, France the same year he graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada. Savage, who served in the 56th Field Coy, Royal Engineers, informed Claxton about the recruiting (hazing) practises then in place at the RMC. As Minister of National Defence, Claxton gave instructions that abuses would not be tolerated when RMC reopened after the war.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1954 he retired from politics, but continued to play an important role in the creation of the Canada Council. He was just sixty-one when he died. At his death in 1960, The Montreal Gazette wrote that the Honourable Brooke Claxton \"faced death … with unbreakable courage.\" He astounded associates by working hard right to the end and \"never relaxing his grip.\"\nHe was honoured by the University of Saskatchewan with the degree of Doctor of Laws at its Golden Jubilee Convocation in 1959.\nThe Brooke Claxton Building in Ottawa, where the Department of Health is based, was named in his honour.\n\n\n== Archives ==\nThere is a Brooke Claxton fonds at Library and Archives Canada.\n\n\n== See also =",

    "title": "Predictive power",
    "content": "The concept of predictive power, the power of a scientific theory to generate testable predictions, differs from explanatory power and descriptive power (where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained or described by a given theory) in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nA classic example of the predictive power of a theory is the discovery of Neptune as a result of predictions made by mathematicians John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier, based on Newton's theory of gravity.\nAnother example of the predictive power of theories or models is Dmitri Mendeleev's use of his periodic table to predict previously undiscovered chemical elements and their properties. Though largely correct, he misjudged the relative atomic masses of tellurium and iodine.\nMoreover, Charles Darwin used his knowledge of evolution by natural selection to predict that since a plant (Angraecum sesquipedale) with a long spur in its flowers exists, a complementary animal with a 30 cm proboscis must also exist to feed on and pollinate it. Twenty years after his death, a form of hawk moth (Xanthopan morganii) that did just that was found.\nAnother example of predictive power is the prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity that the path of light would bend in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This was experimentally verified by an expedition to Sobral in Brazil and the Atlantic island of Príncipe to measure star positions during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, when observations made by the astrophysicist Arthur Eddington seemed to confirm Einstein's predictions. Although the measurements have been criticized by some as utilizing flawed methodology, modern reanalysis of the data suggests that Eddington's analysis of the data was accurate. Later, more precise measurements taken by radio interferometry confirmed the predictions to a high degree of accuracy.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe predictive power of a theory is closely related to applications.\nGeneral relativity not only predicts the bending of light but also predicts several other phenomena. Recently, the calculation of proper time of satellites has been a successfully-measured prediction that is now incorporated into the method used to calculate positions via GPS.\nIf a theory has no predictive power, it cannot be used for applications.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccuracy paradox\nForecast verification\nInductive probability § Removing theories without predictive power\nPredictive probability of success § Relationship with conditional power and predictive power\nProbability of success\nProblem of induction\nSocial identity theory § Predictive power\nStatistical model validation\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Lady Xian",
    "content": "Lady Xian (or Hsien, Chinese: 冼夫人; pinyin: Xiǎn Fūrén; Jyutping: sin2 fu1 jan4; Vietnamese: Tiển phu nhân; 512–602), also known as Lady of Qiao Guo (or Ch'iao Kuo; Chinese: 譙國夫人), born as Xian Zhen (冼珍), was a hereditary chieftain of the Li people, born to the chieftain of the Xian tribe in Southern China, in what is now Guangdong. She has been deified as the \"Saintly Mother of Lingnan\" (岭南圣母). She died during a tour of Hainan. Former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai called her \"the First Heroine of China\", and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin praised her as \"the role model that the later generations should learn forever\". Lady Xian is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.\n\n\n== Life ==\nLady Xian was born in 512 to the chieftain of the Xian clan of the Li people in Southern China. She lived during the Sui dynasty in what is now Guangdong in Southern China. Her family were hereditary leaders of their clan.\nShe was a notable leader who successfully defended her clan against its enemies, eventually earning her title as Lady of Qiaoguo. Her clan's people were in frequent conflict with neighboring clans. She often tried to prevent them from being involved in wars by relying on diplomacy and negotiations. Her brother Xian Ting, the governor (刺史) of Nanliangzhou (南梁州), was conceited from wealth (as a result of being trading partners with the Chinese) so he often harassed the surrounding counties or robbed them of their belongings, which made people in the Lingnan area miserable. Lady Xian often persuaded him not to do bad things so people's resentment subsided gradually. Thus, thousands of people from Dan'er Commandery (儋耳郡) of Hainan were attracted by her fame and joined her.\nIn 535, she married Feng Bao (馮寶), a Chinese general and son of Feng Rong (冯融), and encouraged an appreciation of Chinese ways among her people. She also helped her son Feng  Pu (馮僕) with the local affairs. She was impartial and incorruptible when resolving the lawsuits. She would punish her clan's people if they committed crimes. As a result, Feng established their authority in the local place. From then on, nobody dared to disobey the government decrees.\nBecause she was a woman of a people who wished to remain autonomous from the Chen dynasty, her accomplishments shocked many Chinese. It is exceptional that any records of her written by Chinese historians exist at all. Emperor Chen Shubao of the Chen dynasty had been impressed with her achievements and bestowed her with many awards, including the title \"Lady of Qiaoguo\".\nShe died in 602 of old age and was honored with the posthumous name of Lady Chengjing (誠敬夫人).\n\n\n== Family ==\nAmong her children, only Feng Pu was known by name. He accompanied his mother into many battles, and like her, he was bestowed awards by the Chen emperor. Lady Xian had three grandsons named Feng Hun, Feng Xian, and Feng Ang. They were all bestowed awards by the emperor. During the Chinese New Year or other festivals, Lady Xian would take out all her gifts sent by the emperors of the Liang, Chen and Sui dynasties and placed them in the yard. She told her grandsons that \"You all should be loyal to the emperor. I had served emperors of three dynasties with loyalty! All these gifts granted by them were the reward of my loyalty. So I hope you all can think about that and be loyal to the emperor. (Original: \"汝等宜尽赤心向天子，我事三代主，唯用一好心。今赐物俱存，此忠孝之报也。愿汝皆思念之!\"). She asked her grandsons to be loyal to the emperor as she did.\n\n\n== Main achievements ==\n\n\n=== Cultural development ===\nIn the Southern and Northern dynasties, human trafficking was very frequent in this area. According to the biography of Wang Sengru in the Book of Liang, Wang Sengru was the Prefecture of Nanhai. Every year many foreign boats docked here because many people were sold in Gaoliang. These foreign businessmen traded their goods for people being sold here. At that time, many businessmen in this county made money by doing this trade, which the officials permitted and did not take any action to prevent it. When Lady Xian rose to power, she took efforts to promote Han feudal culture and successfully abolished the Li trafficking system. She told the Li people to do more good things and be loyal to the country. Moreover, she encouraged the Han Chinese's intermarriage to the people of the Li, which greatly promoted the ethnic communication and integration.\n\n\n=== Suppressing the Hou Jing Rebellion ===\nIn 548, Hou Jing rebelled against the Liang dynasty, which had a destructive effect on the whole country. In 550, Li Qianshi, the rebel leader from Gaozhou tried to entice Feng Bao to join the rebellion, but Lady Xian dissuaded him from joining the rebellion. He defeated Li Qianshi's forces, thus helping general Chen Baxian suppress the Hou Jing rebellion. Her achievement is recorded in detail in the Book of Sui.\n\n\n=== Quelling civil disturbances ===\nIn 558, Chen Baxian established the Chen dynasty. Xiao Bo, the feud",

    "content": "Roy Johannes Henricus Beerens (born 22 December 1987) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a right winger.\nKnown for his quick dribbling and fast sprints, Beerens emerged as a talent from the PSV youth academy, but made his breakthrough as part of the Heerenveen team between 2007 and 2011. After a four-year spell with AZ, he moved abroad and represented German club Hertha BSC and English club Reading, before returning to the Netherlands where he ended his career as part of Vitesse.\nBeerens was part of the Netherlands U21 team winning the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship at home. He made his senior debut for the Netherlands on 11 August 2010 in a friendly against Ukraine.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== PSV ===\nBorn in Bladel, Netherlands, Beerens progressed through the PSV youth academy. He promoted to the second team, Jong PSV, for the 2005–06 season and regularly practiced with the first team. He was also allowed to join training camp for the Peace Cup tournament in South Korea, as part of the pre-season. In the match against Colombian club Once Caldas, Beerens made his first ever senior start. On 25 March 2006, he made his official debut for PSV in a 3–0 win over Willem II, where he came in for Arouna Koné. Beerens' first official goal for PSV's first team came on 15 October 2006 in the home match against Roda JC.\n\n\n==== NEC (loan) ====\nOn 30 December 2006, PSV and NEC agreed on a six-month loan. At NEC, he scored in the derby against Vitesse, among others. He also made his debut for the Netherlands U21 team during this period.\n\n\n=== Heerenveen ===\nAt the end of the 2006–07 season, PSV wanted to extend Beerens' contract, which ran for one more year. In July 2007, however, Beerens decided to sign a three-year contract with Heerenveen. In May 2009, Beerens signed a contract extension with Heerenveen until the summer of 2013. At Heerenveen, he grew into a fan favourite, playing almost every match under head coach Gertjan Verbeek. Although he appeared in almost every game in his final seasons, his playing minutes became less and less, as he had lost his starting place to Luciano Narsingh. This caused Beerens to hand in a transfer request; something Heerenveen was willing to cooperate on, due to his proven for the club.\n\n\n=== AZ ===\nIn August 2011, Beerens moved from Heerenveen to AZ Alkmaar on a four-year contract, reuniting him with former coach Gertjan Verbeek.\n\n\n=== Hertha BSC ===\nOn 11 July 2014, it was announced by German club Hertha BSC that they had signed Roy Beerens on a 3-year deal. He scored his first goal in a 4–2 win against FC Viktoria Köln on 16 August 2014.\n\n\n=== Reading ===\nOn 16 July 2016, Beerens signed a three-year contract with Reading for an undisclosed fee. There, he played under head coach Jaap Stam, a fellow Dutchman. He scored his first goal for Reading in a 2–0 EFL Cup win against Plymouth Argyle on 9 August 2016.\n\n\n=== Vitesse ===\nOn 31 January 2018, Beerens returned to the Eredivisie, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal. After a strong start in 2018, under head coach Henk Fraser, a conflict with his successor, Russian coach Leonid Slutsky followed. Beerens was benched afterwards.\nOn 24 December 2020, he announced his retirement from football.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nIn 2007, Beerens was called up by Netherlands U21 coach Foppe de Haan to be part of his squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands. Beerens participated in their second first round group match against Portugal (2–1 win) to secure a semi final spot and to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the semi-finals against England (1–1, 13–12 after 32 penalty kicks) Beerens came on as a substitute and scored both penalties he had to take in the series. The Dutch went on to retain their 2006 title by beating Serbia 4–1 in the final.\nBeerens also played for the Netherlands at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He was first called up for the senior team for a friendly match against Ukraine in August 2010.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\nBeerens has been described as a versatile winger that can play on either the left or right flank. Furthermore, he was technically gifted. During his career, he was renowned for his quick pace, and his ability to score goals and create chances for others.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n== Honours ==\nPSV\n\nEredivisie: 2005–06\nHeerenveen\n\nKNVB Cup: 2008–09\nAZ\n\nKNVB Cup: 2012–13\n\n\n== References ==",

It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of Terrapene carolina (Terrapene carolina mexicana).\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nThis species is endemic to Mexico.  It is found in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and San Luis Potosí.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nIt lives in areas with tropical climates within humid forests at shallow rainwater puddles.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTerrapene mexicana can reach a length of about 18–20 cm (7.1–7.9 in). The carapace is long and dome-shaped, with rather variable color and markings. The adult males show gray-blue nuances on the head and red or orange nuances on the front legs.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nThe Mexican box turtle does not have much information on them because very few of them are domesticated (kept as pets). However, we do know that they have a lifespan of 100 years. Usually these turtles have water nearby homes and a bush to hide. Having a home by the water will attract insects, which are a big part of their diet.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\nBibliography\nRhodin, Anders G.J.; van Dijk, Peter Paul; Inverson, John B.; Shaffer, H.

He currently also serves as co-president of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP) along with Mattea Meyer. He has formerly served as president of the Young Socialists of Switzerland (JUSO) and also a former vice president of the SP.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWermuth was born 19 February 1986 in Jegenstorf, Switzerland, the older of two sons, to Otto Wermuth, a special education teacher, and Laurence Wermuth (née Dind; 1953–2014). He has a younger brother Yann Wermuth (born 1989). \nHis paternal family originally was from Eggiwil. He had an italian-born grandmother from the German-speaking Trentino Alto Adige region who fled Fascism during World War II and came to Switzerland. Wermuth was raised partially in Stetten, Lenzburg, Bünzen, Boswil, Baden, and Freiamt. His upbringing included living on farms. \nCedric Wermuth graduated from high school in Wohlen and attended the University of Zürich, where he studied political science, history, economics, and philosophy. He has a Licentiate/Master of Arts degree.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nHe became a member of the Young Socialists of Switzerland (JUSO) at age thirteen and Wermuth's active involvement in politics began when he was fifteen. He wrote a letter to the editor criticizing one of the newspaper's authors for deemphasizing right-wing politics in their town. He received a number of threatening and critical phone calls from readers; his parents struggled to protect him without sheltering him.\nIn the mid-2000s, he became \"really politicized\" by his interactions with neo-Nazi groups at his school and worked hard to uproot anti-Semitic conspiracy theories such as those presented in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. He became JUSO's  central secretary in 2005, and served as its president between 2008 and 2011. In 2010 he was sentenced to a fine for trespassing after having taken part in a squat of a hotel in Baden in 2009. During this time, he worked as a personal assistant to Urs Hofmann; and in development cooperation for Solidar Suisse. He served on the Baden Residents' Council from 2010 to 2011. In 2011, just months after resigning as president of JUSO, he joined the National Council as a member of the Finance Commission and the president of a finance sub-committee. Shortly after, he was elected as the vice president of the Federal Assembly's SP. In 2015, he moved to the State Politician Commission and the Business Audit Commission, where he served until 2019 and 2020.  He was also elected vice president of the SP Parliamentary Group in the Federal Assembly during this time. He was a candidate for the Swiss Council of States for the Canton Aargau in the Federal Elections of October 2019, but was not elected. But during the same election he was also a candidate for the National Council, for which he was re-elected. As of 2021, he is in his third legislative term and part of the Economic and Taxes Commission. He also consults for Spinas Civil Voices, a civil rights organization in Zürich.\nHe and Mattea Meyer were elected co-presidents of the SP in 2020 as Christian Levrat stepped down. They received 96% of the vote. In the following months, opponents of the SP labeled Wermuth quiet and uninterested as opposed to Meyer, who they thought had more presence. In response, he criticized them for assuming she would be doing the secretarial work while he served as the face of their presidency. He also pointed out that Meyer was asked questions about work/family balance during their campaign while he was not, and how her hate mail and criticism often contains sexual violence threats unlike his.\nHe values working with many different personalities and ideologies. Despite not agreeing politically, he and Thierry Burkart, who also represents Aargau,  established the Mittelland Rail Link Committee, which aims to improve transportation in the canton. He also collaborates with those within his party; he co-wrote Die Service-Public-Revolution, published in 2020, with author Beat Ringger and is currently writing a book with Mattea Meyer.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nWermuth espouses left-wing politics and wants the SP to be more radical. While the SP's opponents call them the \"Prohibition Party\" due to the constraints they aim to put on corporations, Wermuth and Meyer want it to be known as the \"Freedom Party\".\n\n\n=== Climate change ===\nWermuth and his family live in a housing co-op, share a car with other families, and buy vegetables directly from the source to lower their footprint. He regards climate change as a class issue and wants to increase non-profit housing construction and expand solar energy both to save the environment and to improve quality of life for impoverished families. He thinks Switzerland should participate in the Green New Deal and that p",

    "title": "Old Northside Historic District",
    "content": "Old Northside is a residential neighborhood near downtown in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is bordered by 16th Street on the north,  Pennsylvania Street on the west,  Interstate I-65 on the south, and Bellefontaine Street on the east. The Monon Trail runs along the eastern edge of The Frank and Judy O'Bannon Old Northside Soccer Park.\nOld Northside was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and is home to many residences from the Victorian era.\n\n\n== History ==\nOld Northside was a prominent residential neighborhood in the late 19th century, when many of Indianapolis' wealthier residents built mansions in the area. Old Northside was home to Benjamin Harrison (23rd President of the United States), Ovid Butler (founder of Butler University) and other notable figures, including magnates of the L.S. Ayres department store. Indiana author Meredith Nicholson was also a resident for many years and wrote his most noted work House of a Thousand Candles while in residence.\nOld Northside was also the original location of Indianapolis' Butler University, then named North Western Christian University, which was later relocated to the town of Irvington.\nThe neighborhood began a slow decline in the early 1910s as architectural tastes changed and families built homes further north in Indianapolis. Over several decades, homes were demolished and others fell into disrepair.\nIn 1937, the Homeowner Loan Corporation (HOLC) classified 73 Indianapolis neighborhoods into four categories based on perceived investment risk. The Old Northside was graded \"C\", or hazardous, and colored yellow, and was surrounded by redlined neighborhoods. In the late 1960s, residents began restoring remaining buildings of architectural significance, and petitioned the city for historic recognition. By the 1990s, the Old Northside was gentrified, with the population of white residents more than doubling between 1970 and 2016.\nOld Northside received historic designation in late 1978 after adopting a plan for preserving the architecture and history of the neighborhood. Disagreement arose between those seeking National Register designation and lower-income residents of the Old Northside, who were represented by the Citizens Neighborhood Coalition and feared displacement from their homes. A 1979 IUPUI study determined that minimal displacement had taken place due to the historic preservation of the neighborhood.\nPreservation of the neighborhood's history is overseen by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission.\n\n\n== Residences and museums ==\nThe President Benjamin Harrison Home and the Morris-Butler House, both on the National Register of Historic Places,  are located in Old Northside and are open to the public for tours and special events.  In 2010–2011, the former Central Avenue Methodist Church, later known as the Old Centrum, underwent a multimillion-dollar major restoration as a performance venue and statewide headquarters of Indiana Landmarks and is now known as the Indiana Landmarks Center.  The former home of Thomas Taggart is now the national headquarters of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThere are three parks related to Old Northside, all created with funding from the Old Northside Foundation. Great Oak Commons is a park created by the neighborhood from several empty lots and is landscaped as a Victorian walking park with a central fountain, gas lighting, a gazebo and a sensory garden filled with fragrant perennial flowers. Shawn Grove Park is a children's park with play equipment. The Frank and Judy O'Bannon Soccer Park was created by the city of Indianapolis on the east edge of the neighborhood, with the help of Old Northside Foundation. It is now maintained by Indy Parks. It was reclaimed from abandoned space near the former Monon train tracks and is used by several children's summer soccer leagues.\n\n\n== Neighborhood organizations ==\nThe Old Northside Neighborhood Association was created in 1979, and has been active in preserving the historic architecture of the neighborhood and providing cultural and social activities for the neighborhood.\nThe Old Northside Neighborhood Foundation was created in 1990 to raise funds for neighborhood projects, including funding for the neighborhood parks and conversion of street lights to historically appropriate designs.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of neighborhoods in Indianapolis\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Center Township, Marion County, Indiana\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIndianapolis, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary\nOld Northside Neighborhood Association's Web Site\nOld Northside Neighborhood at NPS.gov\nIndianapolis Historic Preservation Commission\nOvid Butler Biography\nOld Northside Flickr Photo Pool",

    "content": "Esther Seligson (25 October 1941 – 8 February 2010) was a Mexican writer, poet, translator, and historian. She was an academic, with a wide range of interests including art, cultural history, Jewish philosophy, mythology, religion and theater. She published books, poems, short stories and translations. She won the Xavier Villaurrutia Prize and the Magda Donato Award for her literary contributions.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEsther Seligson was born 25 October 1941 in Mexico City, Mexico, to a family of Orthodox Jews.  She wanted to be a dancer, but her parents were strongly opposed, so she began studying chemistry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico before changing her academic direction.\nSeligson studied Spanish and French Literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and earned a Master's in art history at the Instituto de Cultura Superior (Institute of High Culture). She continued her studies at La Sorbonne and the University of Bordeaux, focusing on history, the Middle Ages, and philosophy. Later, she studied Jewish culture at the Centre Universitaire d'Etudes Juives (The University Center of Jewish Studies) in Paris and Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem.\nSeligson began publishing at the age of twenty-four in the Cuadernos del Viento de Huberto Batis and Revista Mexicana de Literatura. She published, her first book, Tras la ventada de un árbol, a collection of stories, at twenty-eight and followed it with Otros son los sueños which won the 1973 Premio Xavier Villaurrutia (Xavier Villaurrutia Prize) from the National Council for Arts and Culture. One of her most important works is La morada en el tiempo (1981), which evaluated the isolation of a Jewish believer throughout time. In her 1984 book, Diálogos con el cuerpo she looks at the body, the heart, lungs, stomach, as a lover, in a sensual discovery of their sensations. These were followed by Luz de dos (1989), which won the Magda Donato Award. She published many other works, mostly not for commercial audiences. Her last book, Todo aquí es polvo was finished three weeks before her death and was published posthumously.\nShe taught theater history at the Centro Universitario de Teatro (University Center of Theater) at UNAM for twenty-five years and at the Centro de Estudios Hebraicos (Centre for Hebraic Studies). She also served as a guest lecturer at Centro de Arte Dramático A.C. (CADACP), Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura (INBA), Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH), Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM), as well as many other institutions. She possessed a wide range of expertise and taught courses on art of the Middle Ages, comparative religion, cultural history, ideological history, Jewish philosophy, mythology, theater history, theatrical production and stagecraft.\nThroughout her career, Seligson collaborated in many newspapers and magazines in Mexico. She translated the work of Romanian philosopher Emile Michel Cioran; Egyptian Jewish poet, Edmond Jabès; Emmanuel Levinas; Virginia Woolf; and Marguerite Yourcenar, as well as others. She was made a fellow of the Mexican Center of Writers in 1969, served as project coordinator of the Directorate General of Popular Culture from 1977 to 1979 and was on the editorial board of the magazine Escénica, published by UNAM.\n\n She enjoyed traveling, believing that \"It's good to be wandering pilgrim. Feeling alien in every city where you live gives you more emotional contact.\" She journeyed to southern India, Paris, Prague, Tibet, and Toledo, Spain. For a brief period, Seligson settled in Lisbon and later took up residence in Jerusalem.\nSeligson died 8 February 2010 in Mexico City, Mexico and was buried in the Panteón Israelita.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nThe selection of works (in Spanish) follows the listing of the Coordinación Nacional de Literatura Registra y Difunde la Literatura en México.\n\n\n=== Essays ===\nLa fugacidad como método de escritura, Plaza y Valdés, 1988.\nEl teatro, festín efímero, UAM, Cultura Universitaria, 1989.\nEscritura y el enigma de la otredad, Ediciones Sin Nombre, 2000.\nApuntes sobre Cioran, FONCA/CONACULTA, La Centena, 2003.\nA campo traviesa, FCE, Letras Mexicanas, 2005.\n\n\n=== Novels and short stories ===\nTras la ventana un árbol (1969)\nOtros son los sueños (1973)\nLa morada del tiempo (1981)\nDiálogos con el cuerpo (1981)\nLas figuraciones como método de escritura (1981)\nSed de mar (1986)\nLuz de dos (1989)\nLa fugacidad como método de escritura (1989)\nLos siete pecados capitales (colectivo) (1989)\nEl teatro, festín efímero (1990)\nIndicios y quimeras, isomorfismos (1991)\nA campo traviesa (2005)\nToda la luz (2006)\nTodo aquí es polvo (2010, released posthumously)\n\n\n=== Poems ===\nTránsito del cuerpo (1977)\nDe sueños, presagios y otras voces (1978)\nRescoldos (2000)\nSimiente (2003)\nAlba marina (2005)\nOración del retorno (tikun) (2006)\nA los pies de un Buda sonriente (2007)\nNegro es su rostro (2010)\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n== Refer",

    "content": "A Minoan Sarcophagus, also called a larnax, is among the major display pieces of the antiquities collection of the Museum August Kestner in Hanover, Germany.\nThe larnax is dated to the fourteenth century BC, which corresponds to the Late Minoan III A period, and probably comes from the island of Crete. It entered the antiquities collection of the Museum August Kestner in 1989 (inventory number 1989.30)\nLarnakes are pottery sarcophagi modelled on similar coffins in wood and were a standard part of Late Minoan funerary practices. Too small for bodies, they were used as \"ash-chests\" after cremation.  The Hanover larnax survives largely complete except for the fragmentary lid. Missing portions, especially on one of the short sides, have been reconstructed in modern times. The remains of the lid have been connected together and partially restored. The lid is decorated with two bands of waves, one on top of the other. The lid has the form of a pitched roof, flattened where it meets the edge of the sarcophagus, so that it sits firmly on the sarcophagus. \nThe sarcophagus itself is painted on all four sides in a single brownish colour, which is typical.  As usual, the composition of the painted scheme is elaborate, but the technique is rather crude by the standards of earlier Minoan painting in palaces.  On the main side, a tree is shown in the centre, with dogs on either side chasing after goats, which have been pierced by spears. One of the short sides shows two wild goats fighting each other, the other short side and the reverse have floral motifs. The interior of the sarcophagus is not nearly as carefully worked as the outside. At the edges of the longs sides, handle holes have been created, but on both sides they only survive at one end. The sarcophagus' legs are protruding pillars at all four corners, which run from the rim to the ground. Apart from a column on the back side, which was decorated with floral patterns, all columns are decorated with thick painted stripes alternating with bare clay.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHans-Georg Dettmer: „… den Sinn für das Schöne erwecken …“.

    "title": "Old-age and survivors insurance in Switzerland",
    "content": "Old-age and survivors insurance (OASI, French: AVS German: AHV) constitutes one of the main social security schemes in Switzerland.\nThe federal law on OASI was passed on December 20, 1946, and approved by popular vote on July 6, 1947, by almost 80% of the votes. It was subsequently harmonized and coordinated with the federal law on disability insurance adopted in 1959. A series of ordinances, the most important being the regulation on old-age and survivors insurance, specifies this.\nFrom the January 1, 1948, date of its entry into force, this legislation underwent numerous modifications. Until 1974, the evolution of the OASI was a fairly accurate reflection of the post-war economic boom. Between 1975 and 2008, the OASI was subject to ten actual revisions and three minor legislative revisions. An 11th revision is under discussion in 2009.\nThis is a pay-as-you-go pension system, the law on occupational pensions (2nd pillar) being a funded pension system. The OASI also allows for a (partial) redistribution of wealth. According to the Federal Social Insurance Office, the OASI is “the most important branch of the Swiss social insurance system”.\n\n\n== Mandatory contribution ==\nAll people carrying out gainful activity in Switzerland are required to contribute, as well as, under certain conditions, people working abroad on behalf of an employer in Switzerland. Since January 1, 1997, date of entry into force of the last (10th) revision of the OASI, widows and married women without gainful activity are now subject to the obligation to contribute. However, the contributions of a married woman without gainful activity are considered to be paid if the husband is in gainful activity and has paid at least double the minimum contribution. This rule is independent of sex: the husband without gainful activity of a woman who exercises gainful activity also does not pay a contribution if his wife has paid at least double the minimum contribution. Contributions are not capped and represent 8.7% of income for employees (paid equally between the employee and the employer) and 8.1% for the self-employed. People domiciled in Switzerland, but not engaged in gainful activity, are also required to pay contributions based on assets and income acquired in the form of an annuity. The minimum contribution for non-active people is between  CHF 478 and CHF 23,900  per year.\n\n\n== History of the OASI ==\n\n\n=== Before the introduction of the OASI ===\n\nUntil the 19th century, it generally fell to families, charities and churches to care for elderly people unable to work. There was also a rudimentary system of public assistance for the needy, although the rules were often restrictive. Between 1883 and 1889, Otto von Bismarck established social insurance (sickness, accidents, disability and old age) in Germany. At the same time, voices were raised in Switzerland to demand the establishment of social measures making it possible, in particular, to fight against the glaring poverty of working families. In 1890 the first constitutional basis for health and accident insurance was thus created. However, it took more than twenty years (1912) for a law to be accepted by the people and for this assurance to become reality.\nThe introduction of old-age and survivors insurance was among the demands of the 1918 general strike.\nThe constitutional basis of the OASI was created in 1925; a first project, however, was rejected by the people in 1931. During the Second World War (1939–1945), the Federal Council took advantage of its extraordinary powers to promote the development of social insurance. This is how he created the allowance schemes for loss of salary and earnings intended for the military – which today have become allowances for loss of earnings –, the organization and method of financing of which served as the basis for the OASI. On July 6, 1947, during a second vote, the federal law on old-age and survivors insurance (LAVS in French) was widely accepted by the people. It came into force on January 1st of the following year.\n\n\n=== Since the establishment of the OASI (criar referencias) ===\nSince 1948, the LAVS has been revised ten times. Originally, the maximum pension was 40 francs, which would currently be equivalent, taking inflation into account, to 183 francs.\nThe minimum pension today amounts to 1,175 francs. During the 7th revision of the OASI (1969), the amount of pensions was increased to 220 francs. During the 8th revision (1973), pensions were increased by 80% and, two years later, by another 25%. Combined with additional benefits, introduced in 1966, the OASI pension guarantees the minimum subsistence level, in accordance with the aim enshrined in the Constitution. Since the 9th revision of the OASI, pensions are regularly adapted to inflation and price changes. In 1997, the 10th revision introduced the individual pension system, as well as income splitting. Each person thus receives their own pension, whatever their marital status, and the i",

    "content": "The Midnight Snack is a Tom and Jerry cartoon released on July 19, 1941. It is the second of the Tom and Jerry films, returning to the basic premise of the previous film, Puss Gets the Boot, following that cartoon's Academy Awards nomination.\nThis cartoon features the second appearance of Tom and Jerry, and is the first in which the characters are given their familiar names; in the first cartoon, Puss Gets the Boot has the cat named Jasper, and the mouse named Jinx.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe cartoon takes place in a kitchen at midnight. Jerry pokes his head out of the refrigerator door and steals some cheese, unaware that Tom is watching him. Tom weighs the mouse down enough such that he can no longer see in front of him. After Jerry falls off from a rolling pin, Tom emerges from his hiding place with a smug face.\nJerry \"salutes\" the cat and returns the slice of cheese to the refrigerator. He then proceeds to steal just a tiny bit of cheese, but Tom stomps on his tail with one of his hind paws and replaces the cheese. However, the cat soon realizes that he has the free run of the refrigerator, so he places an iron on top of Jerry's tail and begins eating. Jerry frees himself, but is soon caught by Tom and returns himself to the iron.\nTom then presents Jerry with the wedge of cheese, but the iron attached to Jerry's tail prevents him from reaching the cheese. Tom then proceeds to allow Jerry to lick some cream off a few donuts, and then the mouse gets sprayed with the rest of it, plus a cherry for good measure. Tom then smells the cheese, but soon sees that it is the wedge of cheese, much to his nose's displeasure, and tosses it away. Unfortunately, the cheese smashes some crockery and wakes up Tom's owner, Mammy Two Shoes, who goes downstairs. Tom quickly shoves Jerry into the refrigerator and hides. Mammy rushes in and opens the fridge, screaming in terror when she spots Jerry. Leaping onto a stool and comically hiking up numerous, patterned layers of underclothes, Mammy calls Tom who emerges and pursues Jerry. In the midst of the chase, Mammy leaves the room.\nTom surprises Jerry behind a trash bin, but Jerry tricks Tom into looking over the bin and jumps on the pedal, sending it to crash into Tom's face. Jerry then jumps into the toaster and Tom starts it. Jerry pops up, his tail is on fire, and cools it in a sink full of water, only to be chased again by Tom. Tom ends up losing his grip and gets his tail caught up in an ironing board, with his body facing the refrigerator. Jerry climbs down the blind, picks up a fork with his tail and stabs Tom with the fork, causing Tom to slide down the board and eventually breaking the plates, up a washing board, onto the grater and crashes into the fridge just as Jerry had planned.\nMammy re-enters the room on the belief that Tom has caught Jerry and disposed of Jerry. Then she opens the refrigerator door to get Tom a bowl of cream, only to find Tom in the refrigerator, covered in food. Jerry overhears Mammy shouting at Tom and kicking the screeching cat out of the house while munching on his wedge of cheese and feeling very pleased with himself.\n\n\n== Voice cast ==\nHarry E.

    "title": "Meridian (novel)",
    "content": "Meridian is a 1976 novel by Alice Walker. It has been described as Walker's \"meditation on the modern civil rights movement.\" Meridian is about Meridian Hill, a young black woman in the late 1960s who is attending college as she embraces the civil rights movement at a time when the movement becomes violent. The story follows her life into the 1970s through a relationship that ultimately fails, and her continued efforts to support the movement.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nSet in the 1960s and 1970s, Meridian centers on Meridian Hill, a student at the fictitious Saxon College, who becomes active in the Civil Rights Movement. She becomes romantically involved with another activist, Truman Held. They have a turbulent on-and-off relationship, during which she becomes pregnant by him.\nAfter Meridian has an abortion, Truman becomes far more attached to her and longs for them to start a life together. Later, Truman becomes involved with a Jewish woman, Lynne Rabinowitz, who is also active in the Civil Rights struggle, though perhaps for the wrong reasons.\nAs time passes, Truman attempts unsuccessfully, to achieve personal and financial success while Meridian continues to stay involved in the movement and fight for issues she deeply believes in.\n\n\n== Themes and critiques ==\nWalker wrote the novel at a time when many young black people were shifting away from supporting the practice of nonviolence and civil disobedience that had characterized the early years of the movement and had begun to take on more militant and extreme positions thereby alienating some supporters. Several literary critics believe that the novel is a critique of the Civil Rights Movement from that period. They interpreted Walker's work as suggesting that the revolution never addressed the suffering of women. Rather it perpetuated destructive and often chauvinistic values.\nSome critics thought that Walker used Meridian to showcase her womanist, as opposed to feminist attitudes. A strong believer in the inherent power of the woman, Walker depicts her title character as an innately tough and resolute person, though not one without problems. Walker argues that personal struggles are an unavoidable part of life. She believes this is how individuals overcome obstacles and ultimately define their characters. Meridian features earlier examples of strong female role models.\n\n\n=== Disagreements in the civil rights movement ===\nThroughout Meridian, Walker examines how Meridian, Anne-Marion, and other characters in the Civil Rights Movement have differing ideas of how to proceed for racial justice. Unlike her friend Anne-Marion, Meridian is not ready to become fully radicalized. Throughout the book Meridian risked her life to affirm the principle of integration, for it had already been established as law, rather than give up the practice of non violence. Toward the end of the novel, Meridian continues to risk her health and her own happiness to continue working in grassroots activism, long after the Civil Rights Movement, torn apart by differing ideas within the movement regarding the practice of non-violence, is declared over.\n\n\n=== Motherhood ===\nIn Alice Walker's \"Meridian\", the theme of motherhood is very prevalent but is not highlighted in the traditional way. Meridian who becomes a mother really young has an experience with motherhood most would frown upon. In most cases mothers decide to stick with the child they birthed because that is what most people do but Meridian chose the opposite. Meridian does not take the traditional route of motherhood but instead she defies society rules and creates a life suitable for herself. She decides to give up her son to follow her desires of going to college and being a writer. In the book, the examples of motherhood around Meridian were very \"heroic.\" However, this \"heroism\" was not out of strength it was out of necessity and Meridian sought to change that, with the action of giving up her child to pursue her dreams.\nUpon getting pregnant out of wedlock in Meridian's teenage years she is expelled from school and forced to give up her education.  Meridian after a few years decides to give up her son Eddie Jr because she realizes that her son had prevented her from achieving her dreams and ambitions. Meridian chose to give up her son because she did not want to repeat what her mother had done; her mother too had given up her teaching career upon having children. There are multiple other examples of the difficulties of motherhood in the book. Meridian's friend Nelda is also forced to give up her education upon getting pregnant. Another example was a thirteen-year-old girl who killed her child and was in prison for that crime.  While visiting the girl Meridian's sympathies are not with the girl's murdered child but rather her sympathies are with the young mother who killed her child. These girls had dreams which became paralyzed by their teenage pregnancies.\nWalker suggests in the novel that motherhood is not for all women d",

The circuit was built in 1975, when the country was a part of Soviet Union; since the foundation of Fédération Automobile de l'Ukraine (FAU) in 1993, it hosts various regional racing series, such as Ukrainian Touring Championship and Superbike.ua.\nChayka became very popular and known as the best track in USSR due to very fast sectors near the finish line and corners 2-4, that were known as so-called 'ears'. The track was also difficult and dangerous, there was no runoffs, very close  barriers, poor quality asphalt and bad landscaping. Chayka also had a shorter layout that cuts off the 'ears' sector, it was only used for testing. During Ukraine's independence the track was partially reconstructed with addition of the new layouts that allowed to host automobile and motorcycle circuit racing, karting, autocross, rallying, drift and drag racing competitions.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Soviet Union ===\nThe development of the circuit began in late 60's by Soviet DOSAAF, a society for cooperation with army, aviation and navy, which also built an airfield next to the track, carrying the same name. The configuration was based on various similar tracks of that time, the project was finished in 1971. The construction began in 1973 and finished in several years.\nJune 27, 1975 circuit saw its first touring races,, which were Ukraine's first national motorsport championship. Later that year the circuit began to host the USSR Circuit Racing Championship, that included formula racing.\nIn 1976 the first race for 'Kyiv Ring' prize was held, eventually it became an annual event. Also the track began to host the championships of Russia and Belarus.\nIn 1977 the circuit hosted its first international series, called Cup of Peace and Friendship becoming the traditional season opener. Also in 1977 Chayka became the final stage for the Rally Russian Winter that started in Russia, went through Belarus and finished in Ukraine.\nIn 1982-1983 a motorcycle speedway and a karting circuit were added to complex as a second construction phase, the karting pit building eventually became a center for a car tuning and modification community. In 1984 the first international karting race took place on Chayka. \nFollowing the fatal accident of Polish driver Christian Grochowski in 1983 it was decided to exclude Chayka from the Socialist Countries Cup, Soviet championship round also got cancelled that season.\nWithout the international races organization quality declined, the races were rare and usually had a small amount of spectators due to lack of advertising. There were several attempts to fix the road, but they've made the situation even worse, the track now obviously consisted of three different types of asphalt.\nIn 1989 it was planned to invite an Austrian company to hold a reconstruction of the complex to raise the level of the track and to attract more tourists, but financial situation prevented this from happening.\nAugust 18, 1991 Chayka hosted the last race of the USSR Circuit Racing Championship. At the time Ukrainian drivers were already using the blue-and-yellow national symbolic that used to be banned.\n\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nAfter the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, DOSAAF property had been inherited by the Defense Assistance Society of Ukraine, this included the Chayka's airfield and racetrack. Due to a lack of funds, some infrastructure and equipment was sold to private owners.\nIn 1993 the track began to host the Ukrainian Circuit Racing Championship organized by the newly-founded Fédération Automobile de l'Ukraine. At first Chayka was the only venue of the championship but since 1995 FAU began to add street circuits from various Ukrainian cities to the calendar in order to give it some variety.\nIn 1995 and 1996 Chayka served as a closing stage for Rally Kyiv that was Slavutych automobile club and was a part of Ukrainian Rally Championship.\nEven with the money from the events the complex still couldn't afford a repavment of the roads that kept deteriorating making the track fall behind the FIA safety standards. FAU was finding a way to keep Chayka in the calendar, reclassifying it as a street circuit to ease the requirements, but simultaneously they were looking for its replacement. In 1996 Kyiv City Automobile and Motorcycle Club (KMAMK) recently founded by racer Serhiy Malyk tried hosting a race at the cloverleaf interchange of Kyiv's newly-built Osokorky district but the racers didn't like its repetitive layout. Chayka hosted races for two more years until its state forced it out of the domestic calendar in 1998. The championship would return to Kyiv in 2001 when Malyk would reach a deal with Olimpiyskyi spor",

It originates in the slopes of Nevado de Toluca and empties southwards into the Balsas River. It bisects the Sierra de Huautla, and a portion of the river is in the Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve. The Amacuzac River is known for its rapids which support extreme sports.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Amacuzac River is one of the most important tributaries of the Balsas River. It originates on the slopes of the Nevado de Toluca, in the State of Mexico, where it is known as Texcatitlán River. The Amacuzac River runs through the valley of Almoloya de Alquisiras, after 75 km it reaches the Sierra de Cacahuamilpa, then it disappears at the foot of Jumil Hill and turns into an underground river.\nWhen it emerges the current is known as the Amacuzac River, in the territory of the state of Morelos. The Cuautla River empties into the Amacuzac River and crosses the town of Amacuzac. It receives the flow of the Chiquito River which collects the waters of Tembembe and Chalma. Finally it reaches the place called Balseadero where it follows its route of about 104 km moving to the southwest, outside Morelos to join the Balsas River.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nThe Amacuzac River is located in the tropical zone and It has a hydrological surface of 117,406 km2, distributed in three sub-regions: High Balsas 50,409 km2, Middle Balsas 31,951 km2, and Lower Balsas 35,046 km2. A total of 45 species, 32 genera and 10 families of aquatic and semiaquatic beetles live near the Amacuzac River. The climate that prevails near the river is the warm humid, mainly in the low part of Amacuzac River. The Amacuzac River is the main water body of the Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve, and flows for over 60 km within the reserve.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nDuring the rainy season, the Amacuzac River swells enough to support some extreme sports such as rafting. The river is divided into two parts, high and low. The high part is approximately 15 kilometers long and it is quiet. The rivers are classified according to their degree of turbulence, from level I to VI, I being the calmest and VI the most dangerous.

After Azov's founder and leader Andriy Biletsky left the unit to focus on politics, Prokopenko eventually arose to the leadership of the Azov Regiment in 2017 and was promoted to the rank of major, becoming the youngest commander in the Ukrainian military. In response to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Prokopenko rose as a leader defending Mariupol from the Russian siege, and commanded the Mariupol garrison. For his leadership role on the frontlines of the war, he was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in March 2022. On July 2023 Prokopenko returned to Ukraine in a prisoner exchange and in August he took command of Azov once again. In April 2025 he was promoted to Colonel became commander of the 1st Azov Corps, a newly-created corps formation with four brigades.\nProkopenko is also known as Redis, an old football ultra nickname that became his military call sign. His subordinates are reported to address him informally as \"Brother Redis\" or \"Comrade Redis\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSince childhood, he has been involved in sports, notably football and martial arts. Together with his wife, he also been involved in skiing, claiming a personal record is 91 km/h.

In a July 2016 interview he described improvements in the military capabilities of his troops: “Although we lost a lot of experienced guys from the old squad, we've grown in quantity and quality. Discipline and combat efficiency have improved. We used to run with bobby pistols and sawn-off shots; now we have opportunities to work with tactical tank groups, armored vehicles, artillery support. We gradually developed our military science doctrine—starting with practice, not theory. In the course of training and fighting, the lads mastered tactics and small arms proficiency. Many new possibilities opened for us: we can operate independently on the frontlines, free of other subunits that constantly let us down in combat operations.” In September 2017 he was promoted to the rank of major and given control of the Azov Regiment, becoming the youngest commander in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n\n==== Defence of Mariupol ====\n\n \nFollowing the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prokopenko recorded a video message on 7 March 2022 in which he called for closing the skies over Ukraine to help avert humanitarian collapse in Mariupol, since “the enemy is breaking the rules of the war by shelling the civilian people and destroying the infrastructure of the city; the enemy is subjecting Mariupol to another genocide.”\nOn 19 March 2022, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded the title Hero of Ukraine to the commanders of two units that led the defense of Mariupol: Prokopenko and the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, Colonel Volodymyr Baranyuk. Major Denis Prokopenko received the highest honor “for bravery, for effective tactics to repel enemy attacks, and for protection of the hero city of Mariupol.”\nOn 12 April 2022, Prokopenko appeared in a video message, to report on charges that Russian chemical weapons had been dropped onto Mariupol in a drone attack: “Yesterday the occupiers used a poisonous substance of unknown origin against military and civilians in Mariupol. The epicenter of the attack was not near the people, so contact with the substance was minimal, which possibly saved lives—but there are still consequences.

    "content": "Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom refers to the practices and standards utilised in constructing electrical installations within domestic, commercial, industrial, and other structures and locations (such as marinas or caravan parks), within the region of the United Kingdom. This does not include the topics of electrical power transmission and distribution.\nInstallations are distinguished by a number of criteria, such as voltage (high, low, extra low), phase (single or three-phase), nature of electrical signal (power, data), type and design of cable (conductors and insulators used, cable design, solid/fixed or stranded/flexible, intended use, protective materials), circuit design (ring, radial), and so on.\nElectrical wiring is ultimately regulated to ensure safety of operation, by such as the building regulations, currently legislated as the Building Regulations 2010, which lists \"controlled services\" such as electric wiring that must follow specific directions and standards, and the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. The detailed rules for end-use wiring followed for practical purposes are those of BS 7671 Requirements for Electrical Installations. (IET Wiring Regulations), currently in its 18th edition, which provide the detailed descriptions referred to by legislation.\nUK electrical wiring standards are largely harmonised with the regulations in other European countries and the international IEC 60446 standard. However, there are a number of specific national practices, habits and traditions that differ significantly from other countries, and which in some cases survived harmonisation. These include the use of ring circuits for domestic and light commercial fixed wiring, fused plugs, and for circuits installed prior to harmonisation, historically unique wiring colours.\n\n\n== Common terminology ==\n\n\n=== Regulatory ===\nBS 7671 \"Requirements for Electrical Installations.

    "title": "Herluf Trolle Land",
    "content": "Herluf Trolle Land is an area in Peary Land, North Greenland. Administratively it is part of the Northeast Greenland National Park.\nThe area has two clearly defined parts: Herlufsholm Strand, the flat southeasterly point of Peary Land, and the easternmost mountainous hinterland of the peninsula which rises to the north of Independence Fjord.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere are ancient archaeological remains in the area, including the frame of a 10.6 metres (35 ft) long umiak and a number of camping grounds with abandoned utensils, that were found at excavations in Herlufsholm Strand. This coastal zone may be the first place of the eastward spreading of the early Arctic Whale Hunting Culture from Alaska.\nIn 1900 Robert Peary discerned Cape Clarence Wyckoff, a broad headland on the northeastern shore of Herluf Trolle Land, from Wyckoff Island, a place by the shore which Peary mistook for an island. It was the farthest point that he reached after rounding the northern end of Greenland. \nThe coast south of this cape was explored by J.P. Koch in the course of the 1906-08 Danmark Expedition and was named after historical Danish mariner Herluf Trolle (1516 – 1565). Later it would be mapped accurately by Lauge Koch by means of surveys that he undertook during the Danish Bicentenary Jubilee Expedition in 1920-23 and the cartographic air expedition of 1938.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHerluf Trolle Land is located in southeastern Peary Land, on the northern side of the mouth area of the Independence Fjord. The limits of the territory are not clearly defined. To the west it is bounded by Melville Land, and to the north by the G.B. Schley Fjord. \nHerluf Trolle Land is the mountainous sector located to the west of Herlufsholm Strand. There are several low mountain ranges in the northeastern portion of the territory and two small ice caps. In the north a mountainous plateau rises to a height of 914 metres (2,999 ft) and 853 metres (2,799 ft) high Mount Clarence Wyckoff rises near Hellefisk Fjord. Except for these heights the area is largely ice-free. The plains bordering the mountain zone are crossed by numerous rivers. \n\n\n=== Herlufsholm Strand ===\nThe coastal zone is known as Herlufsholm Strand, a broad, low-lying strip of land between the Wandel Sea shore to the east and the mountains of the interior to the west. It extends between Cape Eigil Knuth (Kap København) and Cape Henry Parish, with Cape Eiler Rasmussen as the easternmost point. Mudder Bay (Mudderbugten), a 9.2 kilometres (30,184 ft) wide, open bay, is located near the southern limit by Cape Eigil Knuth. The sea facing the Herlufsholm Strand shore is frozen throughout the entire year. Mount Henry Parish rises near the northern end and Kjovesletten is a coastal flatland that lies to the southwest. There are muskoxen in the area.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nH.P. Trettin (ed.), Geology of the Innuitian Orogen and Arctic Platform of Canada and Greenland. 1991\nB.

    "content": "Water is considered a purifier in most religions.\n\n\n== Holy water ==\n\nSome faiths use water especially prepared for religious purposes (holy water in most Christian denominations, mambuha in Mandaeism, amrita in Sikhism and Hinduism). Many religions also consider particular sources or bodies of water to be sacred or at least auspicious; examples include Lourdes in Roman Catholicism, the Jordan River (at least symbolically) in some Christian churches and Mandaeism called Yardena, the Zamzam Well in Islam and the River Ganges (among many others) in Hinduism.\n\n\n== Ritual washing ==\n\nFaiths that incorporate ritual washing (ablution) include Christianity, Mandaeism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, Islam, the Baháʼí Faith, Shinto, Taoism, and the Rastafari movement. Immersion (or aspersion or affusion) of a person in water is a central sacrament of Christianity (where it is called baptism); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Mandaeism (masbuta), Judaism (mikvah) and Sikhism (Amrit Sanskar). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Judaism, Mandaeism and Islam. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases (see Tayammum) after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (wudu). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of misogi).\n\n\n== Immersion of deities ==\n\nIn Hinduism, statues of Durga and Ganesh are immersed in rivers at the final stages of the festivals Durga Puja and Ganesh Chaturthi respectively.\nIn Christianity, the baptism of Jesus is an important moment in Christian theology and is celebrated in Western Christianity as Epiphany. In the Christian East this feast is celebrated as Theophany on January 6.\n\n\n== Water deities ==\n\nWater deities are usually a focus of worship at specific springs or holy wells, but there are also more abstract ocean deities, and deities representing \"water\" as an abstract element, such as Aban in Zoroastrianism.\nExample for local tutelary water deities include Celtic Sulis, worshipped at the thermal spring at Bath, or Ganges in Hinduism, personified as a goddess. The Hindu goddess Saraswati originated as a personification of the Saraswati River in the Rigveda, but became a more abstract deity of wisdom in Hinduism. African examples include the Yoruba river goddess Oshun, the Igbo lake goddess Ogbuide (Uhammiri), the Igbo river goddess Idemili and Agulu Lake (Achebe).\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeluge myth\nFlood geology\nGreek sea gods\nSacred waters\nUnspoken Water\nWashing and anointing\nWater rites\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSabine Jell-Bahlsen, The Water Goddess in Igbo Cosmology; Ogbuide of Oguta Lake.

    "title": "Piviale dei Pappagalli",
    "content": "The Piviale dei Pappagalli (English: Parrot Cope) is a liturgical Cope which was created in the 13th century in Sicily. As the name suggests, parrots are depicted on the coat and are repeated all over the textile. The origin and history surrounding the Cope, as well the precious materials and craftmanship make it to an important textile held within the permanent collection of the Diocesan Museum of Vicenza.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Donation ===\nThere remains a debate at the heart of the Piviale dei Pappagalli history between two conflicting histories. The most popular theory is that the object was donated from King Louis IX of France to Bartolomeo da Breganze alongside the reliquaries of the Thorn of Christ and of the True Cross (1259). During the Bishops return to Vicenza (1260), he constructed the Church of Santa Corona as a place for these relics, the location of which has a symbolic meaning as it was previously a place for the Cathars, who were heretics, hence the presence of the relics and church acted as a cleanser and purifier for this previous perceived evil.\nAs this textile is said to be produced in a Sicilian workshop, it is important to stress King Louis IX connection to Sicily which is made clear through his brother Younger Brother Charles of Anjou, who attained a short reign as King of Sicily (1266–1282). His ascension as King came to fruition through his involvement in the Eighth Crusade which was financially aided by the Pope, specifically Pope Urban IV as well as his brother King Louis IX, which allowed him to further wield influence over the Italian Guelphs and Papal elections. Although the emergence of the Sicilian Vespers rebellion ended Charles of Anjou's reign, it is possible that he may have attained the Piviale during this time and brought it back to Paris and the noble courts. Unfortunately the arrival of the Pivale in Vicenza through the bishop is not documented, thus this missing evidence of its donation and attribution leads scholars to believe in another hypothesis.\nSome scholars believe that it is more plausible that the Piviale could have been gifted from Federico II to Ezzelino da Romano, as the presence of Federico II in the Veneto region is very well documented, specifically in regards to his connection to Vicenza, as Ezzelinos tyranny is also well known, with the fact that he ruled over Vicenza from 1236 to 1259 with the aid and support of Federico II, demonstrating his strong connection to Ezzelino as a close confidant and ally. In addition, Ezzelino married Federico's daughter, Selvaggia (1238) and it is possible that the mantel was donated to him on this occasion as a matrimonial gift. Following the end of his reign, the liberation of Vicenza (1259–1260) allowed Bishop Bartolomeo da Breganze to assume his leadership position, placing the Piviale within his jurisdiction, as the textile would have passed from Ezzlino's death to the commune of Vicenza then to the Church of Santa Corona, for which the Bishop had built.\nAlthough neither of these theories have physical evidence of the inventory of the piece to support them, it can be said that a connection to King Louis IX, may have facilitated stronger associations and more powerful connections than the tyrannical presence of Ezzelino who was aligned with the party of the Ghibellines, who strongly detested papal influence. Here, the object would have attained even greater value following King Louis IX canonisation as St. Louis (1297) heightening its significance as a contact relic of a sanctified object. King Louis IX's stronger association to his Christian faith provides a stark contrast to Ezzelinos excommunication as a heretic by Pope Innocent IV justifying the reason why the Church of Santa Corona would want to erase their connections with a heretical past and a tyrannical leader. Thus, despite the inability to provide any certainty to this change of history, there is a definite reasoning and motive to change the legend and backdate the gift under the already recorded donation inventory from the King of France.\n\n\n=== Provenance ===\nAlthough there is no explicit scholarly material or records which indicates the exact location and workshop which this textile was made, we can assume that due to the lack of silk workshops following the expulsion of Muslims by Frederick II (1220) and the influx of Christian migration, which led to the deviation of silk to raw material such as cotton and linen, that the Piviale must have been made in one of the largest and remaining textile factories within Sicily, that being Palermo's Tiraz Royal Factory.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\nWithin the chest of the church of Corona, the director of the Diocesano Museum, Msgr. Francesco Gasparini found a piece from the textile of the Piviale dei Pappagalli, which aided the restoration process as it allowed proper analyses to ensue, one that had not been able to occur before due to the fragility of the piece. As a result, this led to the publication of a volume o",

    "title": "Akilam one",
    "content": "The Akilam one  is the first among the seventeen parts of Akilathirattu Ammanai, the religious book of Ayyavazhi. This section includes the Kappu, the first part; it tells of the Detchanam, and describes the political and sociological situation in the early world.\n\n\n== The Kappu ==\nThe word, Kappu, in Tamil means \"the act of the author taking refuge in the Almighty before writing a book\". Almost all the ancient works in Tamil begin with Kappu. In this case, however, the Kappu on the one hand functions as an act of the author taking refuge, and on the other hand, reveals the personal liberation of each and every life in the Universe. In this section the author says that, because of the coming of the Kaliyan, God incarnates  the Santror to save and rule the universe under One Word, and I am he who heard which God says about that.\n\n\n== Noolcchurikkam ==\nThis part provides a summary, in a grand style, of all the events of the Akilam from the beginning of the Universe to the end. It gives a little more information about the Vaikunda Avatharam. This part also includes the spread of God in the mind of the author before writing, and also Adiyeduttharulal (the act of  giving the first verse of Akilam, by God to the author).\n\n\n== Benefit of the Book ==\nThis is the part in which Akilam narrates briefly the benefits of it in a religious way. It says that one who hears its reading will attain Ultimate Completeness, and one who abuses it will be sentenced to Hell.\n\n\n== Novelty of Detchanam ==\nAccording to Akilathirattu, Santror took birth in this world before the Kali Yukam in Detchanam, and so this Detchanam is the Land of the earliest civilization of Human Beings. In this part, the novelty, sociology, and theology of the civilization were deeply narrated.\n\n\n== Justice of Governance ==\nThis part tells about the way in which Chozhan (not to be confused with later Cholas), the king of Detchanam, rules his country at an early age, and so suggests the path by which a king should rule his country.\n\n\n== Justice of Divinity ==\nThis part tells about the thought of people about the Almighty and about their religious harmony during that age, and tells the way by which one should be divinized.\n\n\n== Justice of Common Man ==\nThis part of the book tells us about the moral character of the people, and also their way of life in harmony with nature, particularly women.\n\n\n== Integrity of Castes ==\nThis part describes the caste system in the early days. It says that although there were several castes, it was merely a classification; the people of different castes lived as one caste without antipathy.\n\n\n== Neetiya Yukam ==\nThe very first yukam (which is pronounced yugam in Tamil, and which means \"aeon\") was called Neetiya Yukam.  During this time, divine, human, and all other virtues flourished without hindrance. The human race lived united as a family, without distinctions of caste, and were not subjected to uliyams (pronounced oozhiyam, and meaning slavery or severe labour). They did not fear demons, and there was perfect harmony among the creatures of the Earth, as well as among those who lived in the Fourteen Worlds. In this yukam, the king was righteous and did not oppress his people through taxes or other means.\nDuring this peaceful time, Kroni was born. Kroni, who is analogous to Satan in the Christian tradition, is viewed as a primordial personification of evil. Though Kroni is said to have been born with multitudinous limbs, each the size of a mountain, he nevertheless assumes different forms in different yukams: for example, as Ravana or Duroyodhana. In opposition, Vishnu also incarnates in different yukam with different Avatars, for example Rama or Krishna.\nIn order to quell the ravenous hunger in his stomach, Kroni drank all of the waters of the sea. With these waters being insufficient, he swallowed Kailayam, the abode of Sivan (Shiva), then proceeded to devour the entire universe. Mayon, residing with Isvaran (another name for Shiva) in Kailayam, escaped to undertake tavam (tapas, meaning \"austerity\") to receive permission from Isvaran to destroy Kroni. Isvaran granted this permission, but made Mayon aware of the necessity to appear in different forms in the successive six Yukams in order to destroy the Six Fragments of Kroni. Following this advice, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments, and saved the universe. The first yukam thus came to an end.\n\n\n== Chathura Yukam ==\nAccording to Ayyavazhi mythology, in the second yukam, called Chathura Yukam, one of the six Pieces of Kroni was formed as a creature called Kuntomasali in the shape and size of a  mammoth leech, and when it disturbed the tavam of those in Thavalokam, Mayon destroyed it by catching it in a hook.\n\n\n== Request of Devas ==\nAfter the two Yukams are completed, Devas requested of Sivan that as they did not find anyone claiming boons in the previous Yukams, so in the following Yukams, the Asuras should be created with the capability of thinking and looking smart, and",

The season began on February 26 and ended on May 12.\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a late start, the season was shortened from 68 to 24 games, and the WHL officially termed the season as a \"developmental season\". Teams played within their respective divisions only: the Central Division consisted exclusively of Alberta-based teams, the U.S. Division played exclusively in Washington state, all B.C.-based teams played from either Sandman Centre or Prospera Place in Kamloops and Kelowna, British Columbia, and all East Division games were played at Brandt Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan.\nIn Alberta due to protocols agreed upon by the league, a five-day period was required between games involving different opponents. Therefore, all Central Division games were scheduled as home-and-home series on weekends only, and thus no team was scheduled to play more than one opponent per-week.\nOn April 19, citing logistical issues and interprovincial travel restrictions, and following the cancellation of the 2021 Memorial Cup, the WHL announced that it had cancelled the playoffs.

    "title": "Morality play",
    "content": "The morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor drama.  The term is used by scholars of literary and dramatic history to refer to a genre of play texts from the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries that feature personified concepts (most often virtues and vices, but sometimes practices or habits) alongside angels and demons, who are engaged in a struggle to persuade a protagonist who represents a generic human character toward either good or evil.  The common story arc of these plays follows \"the temptation, fall and redemption of the protagonist\".\n\n\n== English morality plays ==\nHildegard von Bingen's Ordo Virtutum (English: \"Order of the Virtues\"), composed c. 1151 in Germany, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and it is the only medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music. Because there are many formal differences between this play and later medieval moralities, as well as the fact that it only exists in two manuscripts, it is unlikely that the Ordo Virtutum had any direct influence on the writing of its later English counterparts.\nTraditionally, scholars name only five surviving English morality plays from the medieval period: The Pride of Life (late 14th century), The Castle of Perseverance (c.1425); Wisdom, (1460–63); Mankind (c.1470); Everyman (1510). The Pride of Life was the earliest record of a morality play written in the English language; the text (destroyed by fire in 1922, but published earlier) existed on the back of a parchment account roll from June 30, 1343, to January 5, 1344, from the Priory of the Holy Trinity in Dublin. However, this textual record was incomplete. The play cut off mid-line, when the character Messenger, at the command of the King, called upon Death; the plot summary provided by the introductory banns, featured at the beginning of the play, indicated that the action continued.\nThe Castle of Perseverance, Wisdom, and Mankind are all part of a single manuscript called the Macro Manuscript, named after its first known owner, Cox Macro of Bury St Edmunds.  A second copy of the first 752 lines of Wisdom is preserved in MS Digby 133. It is possible that the Macro version was copied from the Digby manuscript, but there is also the possibility that both were copied from elsewhere.  Unlike The Pride of Life and the Macro plays, all of which survive only in manuscript form, Everyman exists as a printed text, in four different sources. Two of these four sources were printed by Pynson and two were printed by John Skot. Pamela King notes how Everyman's status as a printed text pushes the boundaries of the medieval morality genre; she writes, \"It was also one of the very first plays to be printed, and in some respects belongs more to the early Tudor tradition than that of the late Middle Ages.\"\nOther English moralities include the fifteenth-century plays Occupation & Idleness and Henry Medwall's Nature, as well as an array of sixteenth-century works like The World and the Child and John Skelton's Magnificence.  Additionally, there are other sixteenth-century plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays as outlined above, such as Hickscorner, but they are not generally categorized as such. The characters in Hickscorner are personified vices and virtues: Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner.\nThe French medieval morality play tradition is also quite rich: for an explanation of French medieval morality plays, visit the French Wikipedia page.\n\n\n== History of the term \"morality play\" ==\nWhile scholars refer to these works as morality plays, the play texts do not refer to themselves as such; rather, the genre and its nomenclature have been retroactively conceived by scholarship as a way for modern scholars to understand a series of texts that share enough commonalities that they may be better understood together. Thus, as scholar Pamela King has noted, the morality plays' \"absolute cohesion as a group\" is \"bound to be questioned in any attempt to define that form in its individual manifestations and theatrical contexts.\"  As for the history of the term itself in modern usage, premodern plays were separated into 'moralities' and 'mysteries' by Robert Dodsley in the 18th century; he categorized moralities as allegorical plays and mysteries as biblical plays, though nothing suggests that the moralities are not biblical or would not conceive of themselves as such.\n\nAlthough they do not explicitly label themselves with the genre title morality plays, some of the play texts self-reflexively refer to themselves with the term game.  While the Middle English spelling of game varies, the noun generally refers to a joy, festivity, amusement, or play. In the opening lines of The Pride of Life, the Prolocutor uses the word game when asking his audience to listen attentively, stating,  Lordinges and ladiis that beth hende,\nHerkenith al with mylde mode \n\n[How ou]re gam schal gyn and",

The aesthetics of new media art, the field in which the artist works, not only open up new dimensions of creativity but also require special qualities from the artist: imagination, a sense of space, and those “metamorphoses of the image” that reveal and visualize strange connections between the real and the virtual, the real and the fictional. It is no coincidence that one of the topics that fascinates the artist is “new nature,” where myths and fictions intersect with impressions of the surrounding world and other, unexpected projections of it.\"\nGalyna Sklyarenko, art historian, curator\n\"Stepan Ryabchenko uses computer graphics for a body of work balancing between the digital format and physical forms.

    "content": "Norwich Bus Station is sited off Surrey Street and Queen's Road, in Norwich, Norfolk, England. It is served by several bus operators, including First Eastern Counties, Konectbus, National Express, Megabus and Sanders Coaches.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land between Surrey Street and Bull Lane was acquired in April 1934 by the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company. The huge garage and station were designed by architect H J Starkey and it was opened in 1936 by the Lord Mayor Walter Riley. The garage had the biggest unsupported roof span in the country, with no pillars or supports in the 52,000 sq ft of floor space. The garage structure was said to have weighed 220 tonnes; 650,000 bricks and nine miles of electric cable went into its construction.\nThe Norwich PT Major transportation project identified the need for a new bus station as the catalyst for the regeneration of an important social and commercial area of Norwich which was previously neglected. Funding was awarded in November 2002 and planning consent was granted in December 2003. Demolition and construction commenced in February 2004; partial opening of the through road for the Park & Ride service was achieved April 2005.\nThe new bus station opened on 30 August 2005, at a cost of £5 million and two months later than planned. With its distinctive steel roof, it won the 2006 SCALA Civic Building of the Year Award. \nThe roof has caused problems and, in February 2013, the bus station had to be closed for two weeks to allow contractors to replace much of the roof to fix leaks.\nOn average, the bus station sees 7,800 bus movements per week, with 200,000 passengers boarding; the information centre helps 21,000 people per week.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThere is an information desk with general information on local buses and national coach services, a waiting area, public toilets and a café.\n\n\n== Routes ==\n\nMost local bus operations in Norwich depart from either Castle Meadow, near Norwich Castle, St. Stephen's Street or from Theatre Street, near Norwich's Theatre Royal. The bus station is reserved for long-distance express services, coach services or Norwich Park and Ride services, with a few local services operating out of the terminus.\nMost notable routes which operate from the bus station, include:\n\nX1 Coastlink: First Eastern Counties operates this flagship service to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft\nX2 Coastlink: First Eastern Counties runs this service to Lowestoft, via the A146 road, calling at Loddon and Beccles\nExcel (Buses display “XL”): A,B and C services operate to Peterborough, via Dereham, Wisbech and King's Lynn; D runs to Dereham.\n8: Konectbus's KonectExpress, operates to Dereham and Toftwood.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorfolk County Council - Norwich Bus Station [1]",

    "title": "Michael Kunze",
    "content": "Michael Rolf Kunze (born 9 November 1943, in Prague) is a foremost German musical theater lyricist and librettist.\nHe is best known for the hit musicals Elisabeth (1992), Tanz der Vampire (1996), Mozart! (1999), Marie Antoinette (2006), and Rebecca (2006).\nHe has also written the lyrics for a number of hit songs (under the pseudonym Stephan Prager), including the number one Billboard hit \"Fly, Robin, Fly\" (1976), and was one of the top 1970s record producers, producing songs for musical acts Silver Convention, Penny McLean, and Sister Sledge. Kunze has won a Grammy Award, ECHO Lifetime Award and holds 79 Gold and Platinum records.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Prague, Kunze is the son of actress Dita Roesler and Walter Kunze, a writer, cartoonist and journalist, who worked for the German language newspaper Prager Tagblatt. He grew up in Southern Germany and attended Klenze Oberrealschule in Munich. He studied law, philosophy and history at LMU Munich.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nKunze started writing music and lyrics during his high school years in the early sixties. The Hamburg folklore group, City Preachers, recorded an LP with some\nof those early songs. The record was anything but a commercial success, but it\nmade the music business aware of Michael Kunze. The first song Kunze\nproduced with Peter Maffay, a 20-year-old newcomer, was called \"Du\" (English Translation: \"You\"). It topped the German charts in the summer of 1970 and went gold.\nWorking with Peter Maffay, Kunze co-wrote the song \"Ich bin wie du\" for Elke Best. Backed with \"Die Spiele der großen Leute\" the recording was produced by Fritz Muschler and released on EMI Electrola 006-30 462 in 1973.\nHis recordings would dominate the 1970s music charts in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. When\nhe produced his first international act, he hit both the top of the Billboard and Cashbox charts in the U.S. with the song, \"Fly, Robin, Fly\".\nHis group, Silver Convention, represented by composer Sylvester Levay and Michael Kunze\nhimself, influenced disco music and was the first German aggregation ever to\nwin the coveted Grammy Award. Based on his success in the U.S. – after \"Fly,\nRobin, Fly\" came such hits as \"Lady Bump\" and \"Get up and Boogie\" – Michael\nproduced albums with a vast and varied array of internationally known\nperformers, including Julio Iglesias, Nana Mouskouri, Herbie Mann, Lulu,\nGilbert Bécaud, Sister Sledge and Caterina Valente.\nIn 1981, Kunze stopped working as a producer but continued to write lyrics for top artists. Taking a temporary hiatus from show business, he wrote the book Highroad to the Stake: A Tale of Witchcraft (German Title: Strasse ins Feuer). It was translated into several languages; The New York Times called it \"a vivid story of a witch.\" He wrote a second book, Give Way To Freedom (German Title: Der Freiheit eine Gasse) on the 1848 democratic revolution in Southern Germany.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nIn the 1980s, the musical began making its way into the center of Kunze's activities. First, he adapted Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita, which was the beginning of his collaboration and friendship with the legendary Broadway director, Harold Prince. The success of his adaptation opened the doors of the German-speaking market for the modern Anglo-American musical and made him the preferred translator for international hit shows. His German version of Cats ran for seven years in Vienna, making it one of the greatest hits of all times in that city. The numerous other musicals Kunze has translated into German include The Phantom of the Opera, A Chorus Line, Song and Dance, Into the Woods, Follies, Assassins, Side by Side by Sondheim, Dorian Gray, Little Shop of Horrors, Aspects of Love, Sunset Boulevard, Kiss of the Spider Woman, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Lion King, Mamma Mia! and Elton John's Aida.\nKunze also started working for television. He conceived and wrote several, 90-minute shows for the major German and Austrian networks (Liebe ist .../ZDF, Sport Gala/ARD, Weil wir leben wollen /ZDF) and developed the ARD Series Showgeschichten. In 1991, he conceived the international Peter Ustinov Gala in Paris, celebrating Sir Peter Ustinov's 70th birthday, starring Sir Yehudin Menuhin, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Petula Clark, Tony Curtis and Montserrat Caballé.\nWith the annual Bambi Award Gala, he created the German counterpart to the American Academy Award presentation. His once-a-year special, Die Peter-Alexander-Show, starring Germany's top musical entertainer, Peter Alexander, and, among others, Richard Chamberlain, Joan Collins and Liza Minnelli (ORF) reached cult status in the 1990s. He also conceived Der Goldene Löwe, the German counterpart to the American Emmy Awards show. Over the years, he has also written a number of articles for German magazines and newspapers (Stern, Frankfurter Allgemeine, ZEITMagazin, Playboy, Süddeutsche Zeitung), exploring his views on the function of entertainment in society and current media issues.\n\n\n== Curren",

    "content": "Bar Elias (Arabic: Arabic: برالياس; also transliterated Barelias, Barr Elias or Bar Ilyas) is a town located in the Zahlé District, Bekaa Governorate, Lebanon. With around 40,000 inhabitants, mostly Sunni Muslims, it is the second largest town, after Zahlé, in the Zahlé District. Bar Elias is a village of the Bekaa Valley, the center of Bekaa. It is known widely for its transit passes, as it is halfway between Beirut and Damascus.\nAs the distance between the center of the northern Bekaa and the south became important because of its central valleys and on the international line of the most important economic centers and the largest commercial markets, Bar Elias has good neighborly relations with the rest of the towns and villages in the province. Easily accessible from all directions and in the center of the Bekaa Valley, Bar Elias is an open gate to all guests and visitors.\nBar Elias is 900 m above sea level, at a distance of 51 km from Beirut via Damascus-Chtoura. It is spread over both sides of the international line between Beirut and Damascus over the exterior 4 km. A lovely green plain extends across distances up to Anjar to the east, Zahlé to the west, Kafr Zabad and Addalhamiah to the north, and Almarj to the south.\nIt consists of a vast land area of about 35000 dunums (3500 hectares), of which about 7000 dunums are residential and the rest agricultural.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1838, Eli Smith noted Burr Elyas as a Sunni Muslim, Greek Catholic and Maronite village in the Beqaa Valley.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe town is situated 52 km (32.31 mi) to the east of the Lebanese capital Beirut.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBar Elias is located in the East of Lebanon.

At the end of the eighteenth century, Bar Elias had less than a thousand inhabitants and 50 houses. By the late 1850s, the population jumped to about 7-10,000 people. The population continued to grow throughout the twentieth century. Today, Bar Elias is home to about 60-80,000 Lebanese.\nBar Elias is the largest Sunni town in much of the Bekaa Valley. 15-20% of the city is Christian; Zahlé province, where Bar Elias is located, has a Christian majority. Like the Christians in Zahlé whose majority is Greek Catholic, 90% of the Christians of Bar Elias are Catholic Christians  and 10% Maronite Christians.

    "title": "Barristers in England and Wales",
    "content": "Barristers in England and Wales are one of the two main categories of lawyer in England and Wales, the other being solicitors. \nBarristers have traditionally had the role of handling cases for representation in court, both defence and prosecution. They are highly-trained legal advisers and courtroom advocates and appear in court when instructed by a solicitor. Strict rules are in place about what a barrister must do for the court, their client and how they must behave. \nThe word lawyer is a generic term, referring to a person who practises in law, which could also be deemed to include other legal practitioners such as chartered legal executives.\n\n\n== Origin of the profession ==\nThe work of senior legal professionals in England and Wales is divided between solicitors and barristers. Both are trained in law but serve differing functions in the practice of law.\nHistorically, the superior courts were based in London, the capital city. To dispense justice throughout the country, a judge and court personnel would periodically travel a regional circuit to deal with cases that had arisen there. From this developed a body of lawyers who were socially familiar with the judges, had training and experience in the superior courts, and had access to a greater corpus of research material and accumulated knowledge on the interpretation and application of the law. Some would go \"on circuit\" with the court to act on behalf of those requiring representation. By contrast, solicitors were essentially local to one place, whether London or a provincial town.\nLawyers who practised in the courts in this way came to be called \"barristers\" because they were \"called to the Bar\", the symbolic barrier separating the public—including solicitors and law students—from those admitted to the well of the Court. They became specialists either in court to represent clients, or in giving oral or written advice on the strength of a case and the best way to conduct it. For those who had the means and preference to engage a solicitor, it became useful, then normal and then compulsory, for the solicitor, in turn, to select and engage a barrister to represent the client before the courts. Likewise, it became either useful or normal (but not compulsory) to engage an appropriate barrister when highly specialist advice was required. Many barristers have largely \"paper practices\" and rarely or never appear in court.\nHistorically, practising at the bar (or in court) was a more socially prestigious profession than working as a solicitor. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the bar was one of the limited number of professions considered suitable for upper-class men; politics, the Army and Navy, the established clergy, banking and the civil and diplomatic services being the others. Many leading 18th- and 19th-century politicians were barristers; few were solicitors. In the 20th century, solicitors narrowed the gap greatly, especially in terms of earnings, and by the early 21st century the social gap was far less important.\n\n\n== Key differences from the profession of solicitor ==\nUntil recently, the most obvious differences between the two professions were:\n\nOnly barristers had exclusive and wide rights of audience (that is, a right to plead) in all courts in England and Wales;\nOnly solicitors could be directly engaged by clients for payment.\nThese differences have been eroded by recent deliberate changes, although in many fields of legal practice, the distinction is largely retained.\nBarristers have full rights of audience to appear in all courts, from highest to lowest. Solicitors, on the other hand, have traditionally been able to appear only as advocates in the lower courts (that is, the magistrates' and county courts) and tribunals. The bulk of such work continues to be handled by solicitors. Under section 17 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, solicitors with appropriate advocacy experience are entitled to acquire higher \"rights of audience\", enabling them to appear in the superior courts. Solicitors who attain these rights are known as solicitor-advocates. But, in practice, there are rather few of these solicitor-advocates, and solicitors often continue to engage a barrister to undertake any required advocacy in court. Not only is this division traditional; in higher-value civil or more serious criminal cases, it is often tactically imperative to engage a specialist advocate (because if one side does not the other might).\nUntil 2004, barristers were prohibited from seeking or accepting \"instructions\" (that is, being hired) directly by the clients whom they represent. The involvement of a solicitor was compulsory. The rationale was that solicitors could investigate and gather evidence and instructions and filter them – according to the interests of the client – before presenting them to the barrister; in return the barrister, being one step removed from the client, could reach a more objective opinion of the merits of the case, working strictly from ",

He was selected by the Houston Texans in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nA native of Centreville, Alabama, Jones attended Bibb County High School, where he was a two-way lineman and team captain. He paved the way for running back Zac Stacy, who rushed for 1,666 yards and 24 touchdowns. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jones was listed as the No. 7 center prospect in his class. Despite living only an hour away from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Jones grew up a Georgia Bulldog fan.\n\n\n== College career ==\nJones became the Bulldog starting center three games into his freshman season (at No. 24 Arizona State), after Chris Davis was moved to left guard.

    "content": "The Left Column (German: Kolonne Links) was an agitprop theater troupe during the 1920s and 1930s. The troupe worked in support of the Workers International Relief (WIR). During the Nazi era, some of the group went into exile in the Soviet Union, where some of the members were arrested by the Soviet secret police in the Great Purge and in connection with the Hitler Youth Conspiracy.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn its early years, the group consisted of nine people, none of whom had any theatrical training, a pianist and a driver. The Berlin troupe was one of the most highly praised agitprop troupes in Germany, despite its lack of training.\nHans Hauska joined the troupe in late summer 1930.\nIn 1931, the Left Column were rewarded with a tour in the Soviet Union for five weeks for having gained 16,000 new members for the WIR. On their return, they discovered that several of their performances in Germany were cancelled because a March 28, 1931 decree from the Reichspräsident to combat violence led to a local prohibition against agitprop theater assemblies. Six members then left Germany, embarking on a 4-month trip by boat and train across Siberia back to Moscow. In 1933, under Gustav von Wangenheim's leadership, they established the German Left Column Theater with members of \"Troupe 31\", another agitprop theater group.\nIn 1935, troupe members Helmut Damerius and Bruno Schmidtsdorf, were in Wangenheim's 1935 anti-Nazi film, Kämpfer. Schmidtsdorf played the lead role, Fritz Lemke, and Hauska wrote the music.\nBeginning in 1935, the NKVD began arresting members of the troupe in the Great Purge. All those arrested were members who had arrived in Moscow after 1932. Arrested members included Hans Hauska on November 20, 1937. On February 5, 1938, Kurt Ahrendt, Karl Oefelein and Schmidtsdorf were arrested, charged with starting a branch of the Hitler Youth, and were executed three weeks later. On March 17, 1938, Helmut Damerius, once a leader of the troupe, was arrested and sent to a gulag in Siberia. His sentence ended in 1946, after which he was exiled to Kazakhstan and forced to remain another eight years. Hauska, after four years in custody, and sentenced in a Nazi court on August 18, 1939 to one and a half years at hard labor in a Zuchthaus, was returned to the Nazis on December 5, 1940 under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Other arrested members were Hans Klering; Max Mielke, who arrived in Moscow in 1932, was arrested in 1938 and never heard from again; Albert Wolff; and Max (Samuel) Katzenellenbogen, a former member of the troupe in Berlin, who fled to Moscow after having been arrested by the Gestapo. He was arrested by the NKVD in 1937 and never heard from again.\nDamerius survived his imprisonment, as did Klering, who returned to Germany in 1946 and became a co-founder of DEFA. Damerius was unable to leave the Soviet Union until 1956.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\nHelmut Damerius\nHans Hauska\nHans Klering\nGustav von Wangenheim\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlue Blouse\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChristine Kanzler, \"Vom Kulturrevolutionär zum 'Volksfeind'.

An anime adaptation of the manga, produced by Studio Deen, premiered on January 5, 2013. A second season premiered in summer of 2013.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFive years prior to the start of the story the residents of Ōtsuka village all died in a plague, with only three survivors; childhood friends Shino Inuzuka, Sosuke Inukawa and a young girl named Hamaji. They take shelter in a church near another village, whose people view the survivors with suspicion. Now the Imperial Church comes in search of \"Murasame,\" the demon blade containing \"life\" which Shino possesses within his body. When the Church realizes that Shino will not come quietly with them, Hamaji is kidnapped, which results in Shino and Sosuke traveling to the Imperial City to rescue her. There they encounter Satomi Rio, a Dean of the Church, who tells Shino he must find the other six bead holders.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== The bead holders ===\nThere are eight bead holders all together, representing the eight young men who appeared with Princess Fuse to fight Tama-Azusa in \"the time of darkness\". Shino and Sosuke have been charged with gathering together the bead holders for some reason by Rio. So far all the bead holders have five things in common; they all have a bead, a peony mark somewhere on their bodies, \"Inu\" at the beginning of their last names, they've all died and come back to life, and they all have a guardian or ability that is keeping them alive.\nShino Inuzuka (犬塚 信乃)\nVoiced by: Tetsuya Kakihara (Japanese); Greg Ayres (English)\nAn 18-year-old boy who is the holder of the \"Devotion\" (孝) bead. Nicknamed 'Shii' by Kaname, he is one of the three survivors of the destruction of Ōtsuka Village. He holds the living sword Murasame in his right arm, along with a peony birthmark. Because of a curse set by harboring Murasame within his body, he is still in his 13-year-old state. Five years before the start of the story, Shino was a very weak and ill child who was made to dress and act like a girl by his parents because they heard doing so would help him grow. Young Shino was told that he would not live into adulthood. He still openly welcomed Sosuke and Hamaji into his home and treated the two abandoned children as brother and sister. Shino even commented that he and Sosuke are brothers when he sees Sosuke's peony mark. Though mentally 18, he does tend to act like his status age, something Sosuke is constantly teasing and lecturing him about. He often has outbursts of emotion, is very energetic and loud yet has a very kind, naïve, and loving nature. Because of this many people are attracted to him, including spirits and humans. He easily makes friends with many people, is usually straight forward, talking or taking action without thinking, which typically concludes with a scolding from Sosuke. He seems quite perplexed by the fact that Genpachi has shown a romantic interest in him, again pointing to his age and naivety. He cares deeply for those around him, to such an extent that he forced Sosuke to continue living after they were fatally injured five years ago. Although his exterior personality is happy and optimistic, he reveals himself to be quite burdened and knowledgeable of the events taking place around him; this is often seen when his thoughts travel to his immortality. He is shown to have a deep fear of the possibility of living alone one day. Shino loves meat, and he is petrified of the living dead and insects, and is usually seen running away or clinging to Sosuke in fear when either appear. Despite his phobias, when he needs to fight he shows great bravery and is calmer, especially with Murasame in hand. Shino often wears a red and white long coat with the church insignia on the back and has short purple hair and greenish yellow eyes. He is revealed to be the younger half brother of Satomi Rio.\nSōsuke Inukawa (犬川 荘介)\nVoiced by: Satoshi Hino (Japanese); Leraldo Anzaldua (English)\nThe holder of the Duty (義) bead. He is another of the three survivors, along with Shino and Hamaji. He can shape shift into the dog Yoshiro, who had been Shino's loyal pet, and has a peony mark on the back of his neck. He treats Shino and Hamaji like family, as he does not have any relatives. He is very strict on safety and tends to be the calm and composed one to Shino's brash and compulsive behavior. He is also very protective of Shino and often volunteers to pay the prices for his deeds, as seen when he was willing to pay the price of having his arm cut off in order to protect Shino when he trespassed into Chikage's house. He is constantly by Shino's side and tends to spend half his time bailing him out of trouble. A mysterious man who looks identical to him, Ao (who was referred to as Sosuke's 'shadow' by Murasame) is said to be the other half of Sosuke's soul. He has a very kind and gentle person",

Then, in 1064, Count Berardo gave the church of Sant'Eufemia and surrounding land at Caramanico to the Abbey of San Clemente a Casauria which retained possession of the town until 1145. In 1145, the area became the possession of Boemondo, who was the Count of Manoppello at the time. Eventually, in 1301 ownership was passed on to the Ughelli family and then to Giacomo Arcucci, the Count of Minervino.

It was produced until 1990, with 400 boats completed, but it is now out of production.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Gulf 32 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It is a cutter riged sloop, with a raked stem, an angled transom, a keel-hung rudder controlled by two wheels, one on the aft cockpit and one in the pilot house. It has a fixed long keel or an optional shoal draft keel. It displaces 16,000 lb (7,257 kg) and carries 6,500 lb (2,948 kg) of ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of 5.17 ft (1.58 m) with the standard keel and 4.5 ft (1.4 m) with the optional shoal draft keel. The boat is fitted with a Universal 40 36 hp (27 kW) diesel engine for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a truncated double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, an L-shaped settee and a straight settee in the main cabin and an aft cabin with a quarter berth on the starboard side. The galley is located on the port side of the wheelhouse. The galley is U-shaped and is equipped with a three-burner stove, ice box and a double sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side.\nThe design has a hull speed of 6.47 kn (11.98 km/h).\n\n\n== Operational history ==\nIn a 2016 article in Cruising World magazine, Ken Painter wrote, \"nine years ago I decided to take the leap from trailer-sailer to smaller ocean cruiser, and went looking for an affordable, seaworthy and comfortable sailboat capable of exploring the Pacific Northwest and maybe, someday, sailing around the world.

It influenced the emergence of dystopia as a literary genre. George Orwell said that Aldous Huxley's 1931 Brave New World must be partly derived from We, although Huxley denied this. Orwell's own Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Animal Farm were also inspired by We, as are many other contemporary dystopian novels.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nWe is set in the far future. D-503, a spacecraft engineer, lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass (presumably to assist with mass surveillance). The structure of the state is Panopticon-like, and life is based upon Frederick Winslow Taylor's principles of scientific management. Society is run centrally by a power known as the Benefactor, and is run according to a strict timetable—people march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by their given designations (referred to as 'numbers' in the novel.) The society in which We is set uses mathematical logic and reason for its scheduling and as justification for its actions. The individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulae and equations outlined by the One State.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA few hundred years after the One State's conquest of the entire world, the spaceship INTEGRAL is being built in order to invade and conquer extraterrestrial planets. The project's chief engineer, D-503, begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship. The book is this journal—it titles chapters as '[n]th Entry' and begins each entry with three lines of notes summarising the events therein.\nLike all other citizens of the One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by the secret police, or Bureau of Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by that status. O-90's other lover and D-503's best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.\nWhile on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are illegal by the laws of the One State.\nRepelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House, notable for being the only opaque building in the One State, except for the windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians but finds that he cannot.\nD-503 begins to have dreams, which disturb him, as dreams are thought to be a symptom of mental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is involved with the Mephi, an organisation plotting to bring down the One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world: humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of the One State with the outside world.\nDespite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503 obliges. During the pregnancy, O-90 realises that she cannot bear to be parted from her baby. At D-503's request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the Green Wall.\nIn his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the \"Great Operation\", which has recently been mandated for all citizens of the One State to prevent possible riots; having been psycho-surgically refashioned into a state of mechanical \"reliability\", they would now function as \"tractors in human form\". This operation removes the imagination and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor, the dictator of the One State, about the inner workings of the Mephi. I-330 is then brought to an interrogation chamber",

It is the fourth series of the RDF Media programme, Shipwrecked, and featured a radically different format from the first three series, in that contestants were divided into tribes, with competitions, voting and a cash prize at stake.\n\n\n== Tribes ==\n\n^Note 1 : James George originally joined Tigers in Week 6, but nominated to Sharks in Week 8 after being found out as a Shark mole by the Tigers.\n^Note 2 : Jo Armstrong is the sister of departed castaway Geoff Armstrong.  Jo originally introduced herself as \"Lorna\" in her week as new arrival to hide her relationship to Geoff.\n^Note 3 : Chris Baddoo made a shock nomination to Sharks in Week 11, but nominated back to Tigers in Week 13 using up his two island moves.\n^Note 4 :  Kevin had nominated to Tigers in Week 13, but was rejected as the Tigers favoured the returning Chris Baddoo.  Kevin successfully nominated to Tigers in Week 14.  As a punishment for the kidnapping of Anna Singleton in Week 16, the Tigers nominated Kevin to go back to the Sharks as a \"punishment\", Kevin had always planned on nominating back to the Sharks anyway.\n^Note 5 :  Gareth nominated to Sharks after an unhappy week on Tigers in Week 14.\n^Note 6 :  Courtney nominated to Sharks in Week 15, after not settling on Tiger Island.\n^Note 7 :  John volunteered to serve the Shark's punishment for setting foot on Tiger Island during the Anna Singleton fiasco.\n\n\n=== Castaways that departed ===\n\n\n== The Kidnapping of Anna Singleton ==\nDuring the sixteenth week in the competition, both tribes were asked to select a member of the opposing side to stay for one night, in a game where numbers are vital this was an ideal opportunity to claim back former members who had switched. The Shark Tribe ask for Katie who is a founding member of the Tigers and is heavily inclined towards them. When the Tigers ask for Anna the Sharks are wary of their strategy and eagerly await the return of their tribe member.\nAfter a night of enjoyment on Tigers Anna becomes close to Chris Brain, the Tigers agree to kidnap Anna for a bit of fun and send a ransom note to the Sharks. (though when they originally voice the idea you can hear Anna agree to it due.) Enraged by the demands, the Sharks endure the 1/2-mile swim and demand the return of their tribe mate who is hiding in the jungle with Chris Brain, Shipwrecked rules dictate that an opposing tribe cannot stand on the opposing island unless invited or if it is a Sunday (generally known as a Beach Party where the new castaway decide their tribe). The Sharks violate this rule by raiding the camp and in doing so taking Kevin with them, thus breaking another rule by unofficially joining an island without nomination. At the Beach Party in which Ryan chose his tribe (eventually, Tigers) they were informed that they would be punished for their actions, and that each tribe must sacrifice one of their own to move permanently. Tiger Island accepted Kevin's wish to return, meanwhile Shark Island's John Melvin volunteered to move.\nWhen Kevin and John swapped necklaces – they were reminded that this was non-negotiable. And they would never bear their old tribes necklace, much to the dismay of Sharks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "content": "Accurate annotation of endoscopic videos is essential yet time-consuming, particularly for challenging datasets such as dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, where the affected regions are irregular and lack clear boundaries. Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.",

    "content": "Counterfactual explanation (CE) is an important domain within post-hoc explainability. However, the explanations generated by most CE generators are often highly redundant. This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting.

    "content": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for building Trustworthy AI systems by enabling privacy-preserving, decentralized model training. However, FL is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise model integrity and data confidentiality, a vulnerability exacerbated by the fact that conventional data inspection methods are incompatible with its decentralized design. While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation on image classification tasks under various adversarial scenarios, demonstrates that RFC significantly improves robustness compared to baseline methods, providing a viable solution for securing decentralized learning environments.",

Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment.

    "content": "Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.",

Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition.

Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation.",

FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.",

This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.",

We propose UniWhisper, an efficient continual multi-task training framework that casts heterogeneous audio tasks into a unified instruction and answer format. This enables standard next-token training without task-specific heads and losses. We train it on 38k hours of public audio and assess the encoder using shallow MLP probes and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) on 20 tasks spanning speech, environmental sound, and music. UniWhisper reaches normalized weighted averages of 0.81 with MLP probes and 0.61 with kNN, compared to 0.64 and 0.46 for Whisper, while retaining strong speech performance.",

Recent self-supervised learning strategies offer a promising alternative, avoiding the need for ground truth. However, most existing methods are limited to linear inverse problems. This work extends self-supervised learning to the non-linear problem of recovering audio and images from clipped measurements, by assuming that the signal distribution is approximately invariant to changes in amplitude. We provide sufficient conditions for learning to reconstruct from saturated signals alone and a self-supervised loss that can be used to train reconstruction networks. Experiments on both audio and image data show that the proposed approach is almost as effective as fully supervised approaches, despite relying solely on clipped measurements for training.",

    "content": "Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \\emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \\emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.",

    "content": "Accurately predicting short-term traffic demand is critical for intelligent transportation systems. While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

    "content": "In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.",

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.",

PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models.

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.",

Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance.

When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings.

Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making.

To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria.

    "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential as autonomous software engineering (SWE) agents. Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro). Performance gains grow with more interaction steps, showing that leveraging past experience benefits long-horizon reasoning in complex software engineering tasks.",

    "content": "Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.",

Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task.

In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches.

We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses.

To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.",

To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text).

We prove this stealth is structural: the maximum accuracy drop from a complete targeted attack is bounded above by the minority class fraction (beta). For real-world class imbalances (Truck approx. 3%), this bound falls below training-run noise, making aggregate accuracy monitoring provably insufficient regardless of architecture or attack method. A companion backdoor trigger attack reveals a novel trigger-dominance collapse: when the target class is a dataset minority, the spectrogram patch trigger becomes functionally redundant--clean ASR equals triggered ASR, and the attack degenerates to pure label flipping. We formalize the ML training pipeline as an attack surface and propose a trust-minimized defense combining content-addressed artifact hashing, Merkle-tree dataset commitment, and post-quantum digital signatures (ML-DSA-65/CRYSTALS-Dilithium3, NIST FIPS 204) for cryptographically verifiable data provenance.",

Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch.",

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation.",

Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections.

    "content": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver detailed responses on vision-language tasks, yet remain susceptible to object hallucination (introducing objects not present in the image), undermining reliability in practice. Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality.",

    "content": "Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.",

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.",

    "content": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework.

This shift selects for a specific organizational equilibrium -- the Headless Firm -- structured as an hourglass: a personalized generative interface at the top, a standardized protocol waist in the middle, and a competitive market of micro-specialized execution agents at the bottom. We formalize this claim as a coordination cost model with two falsifiable empirical predictions: (1) the marginal cost of adding an execution provider should be approximately constant in a mature hourglass ecosystem; (2) the ratio of total coordination cost to task throughput should remain stable as ecosystem size grows. We derive conditions for hourglass stability versus re-centralization and analyze implications for firm size distributions, labor markets, and software economics. The analysis predicts a domain-conditional Great Unbundling: in high knowledge-velocity domains, firm size distributions shift mass from large integrated incumbents toward micro-specialized agents and thin protocol orchestrators.",

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets.",

The two main problems we are interested in are the \\emph{Optimal Decision Tree} and \\emph{Set Cover}. We study these two fundamental tasks under precedence constraints, that is, if a test (or set) $X$ is a predecessor of $Y$, then in any feasible decision tree $X$ needs to be an ancestor of $Y$ (or respectively, if $Y$ is added to set cover, then so must be $X$). For the Optimal Decision Tree we consider two optimization criteria: worst case identification time (height of the tree) or the average identification time. Similarly, for the Set Cover we study two cost measures: the size of the cover or the average cover time.\n  Our approach is to develop a number of algorithmic reductions, where an approximation algorithm for one problem provides an approximation for another via a black-box usage of a procedure for the former. En route we introduce other optimization problems either to complete the `reduction landscape' or because they hold the essence of combinatorial structure of our problems. The latter is brought by a problem of finding a maximum density precedence closed subfamily, where the density is defined as the ratio of the number of items the family covers to its size. By doing so we provide $\\cO^*(\\sqrt{m})$-approximation algorithms for all of the aforementioned problems. The picture is complemented by a number of hardness reductions that provide $o(m^{1/12-ε})$-inapproximability results for the decision tree and covering problems. Besides giving a complete set of results for general precedence constraints, we also provide polylogarithmic approximation guarantees for two most typically studied and applicable precedence types, outforests and inforests.

In contrast, social choice theory provides an alternative approach called maximal lotteries, which aggregates pairwise preferences without imposing any assumptions on their structure. However, we show that maximal lotteries are highly sensitive to preference heterogeneity and can favor models that severely underperform on specific tasks or user subpopulations. We introduce robust lotteries that optimize worst-case performance under plausible shifts in the preference data. On large-scale preference datasets, robust lotteries provide more reliable win rate guarantees across the annotator distribution and recover a stable set of top-performing models. By moving from rankings to pluralistic sets of winners, robust lotteries offer a principled step toward an ecosystem of complementary AI systems that serve the full spectrum of human preferences.",

Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form.

In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5$\\%$ for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed.

Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \\log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces.",

It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction.

    "content": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as multi-step decision-making agents, where effective reward design is essential for guiding learning. Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories. We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate how uncertainty signals enhance exploration and robustness.",

    "content": "Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT learn high-dimensional gene representations, but what biological knowledge these representations encode remains unclear. We systematically decode the geometric structure of scGPT internal representations through 63 iterations of automated hypothesis screening (183 hypotheses tested), revealing that the model organizes genes into a structured biological coordinate system rather than an opaque feature space.\n  The dominant spectral axis separates genes by subcellular localization, with secreted proteins at one pole and cytosolic proteins at the other. Intermediate transformer layers transiently encode mitochondrial and ER compartments in a sequence that mirrors the cellular secretory pathway. Orthogonal axes encode protein-protein interaction networks with graded fidelity to experimentally measured interaction strength (Spearman rho = 1.000 across n = 5 STRING confidence quintiles, p = 0.017).\n  In a compact six-dimensional spectral subspace, the model distinguishes transcription factors from their target genes (AUROC = 0.744, all 12 layers significant). Early layers preserve which specific genes regulate which targets, while deeper layers compress this into a coarser regulator versus regulated distinction. Repression edges are geometrically more prominent than activation edges, and B-cell master regulators BATF and BACH2 show convergence toward the B-cell identity anchor PAX5 across transformer depth. Cell-type marker genes cluster with high fidelity (AUROC = 0.851). Residual-stream geometry encodes biological structure complementary to attention patterns.

    "content": "Neural networks are trained by optimizing multi-dimensional sets of fitting parameters on non-convex loss landscapes. Low-loss regions of the landscapes correspond to the parameter sets that perform well on the training data. A key issue in machine learning is the performance of trained neural networks on previously unseen test data. Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space. Our findings help understand both the topography of the loss landscapes and the fundamental role of landscape exploration strategies in creating robust, transferrable neural network models.",

Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.\n  This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.",

A natural question is whether FISTA can improve the dependence on $α$ from $1/α$ to $1/\\sqrtα$ while preserving the $1/ρ$ locality scaling. The challenge is that acceleration can break locality by transiently activating nodes that are zero at optimality, thereby increasing the cost of gradient evaluations. We analyze FISTA on a slightly over-regularized objective and show that, under a checkable confinement condition, all spurious activations remain inside a boundary set $\\mathcal{B}$.

Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.\n  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved.",

In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients.

Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels.

Source transitions from clusters with small discrepancy are retained, while those from clusters with large discrepancy are filtered out.

To address these limitations, we introduce a kernelized self-attention mechanism, where a learnable positional kernel operates purely in the position space, disentangled from semantic similarity, and directly modulates attention weights. When applied per attention block, this kernel enables adaptive multi-scale sequential modeling.

We demonstrate that learning across $k$ distributions inherently incurs slow rates scaling with $k/ε^2$, even under constant noise levels, unless each distribution is learned separately. A key technical contribution is a structured hypothesis-testing framework that captures the statistical cost of certifying near-optimality under bounded noise-a cost we show is unavoidable in the multi-distribution setting.\n  Finally, we prove that when competing with the stronger benchmark of each distribution's optimal Bayes error, the sample complexity incurs a \\textit{multiplicative} penalty in $k$.

    "title": "Self-Purification Mitigates Backdoors in Multimodal Diffusion Language Models",
    "content": "Multimodal Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to their autoregressive counterparts. Yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show that well-established data-poisoning pipelines can successfully implant backdoors into MDLMs, enabling attackers to manipulate model behavior via specific triggers while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. However, defense strategies effective to these models are yet to emerge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a backdoor defense framework for MDLMs named DiSP (Diffusion Self-Purification). DiSP is driven by a key observation: selectively masking certain vision tokens at inference time can neutralize a backdoored model's trigger-induced behaviors and restore normal functionality. Building on this, we purify the poisoned dataset using the compromised model itself, then fine-tune the model on the purified data to recover it to a clean one. Given such a specific design, DiSP can remove backdoors without requiring any auxiliary models or clean reference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates backdoor effects, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) from over 90% to typically under 5%, while maintaining model performance on benign tasks.",

    "content": "Multi-agent imitation learning (MA-IL) aims to learn optimal policies from expert demonstrations of interactions in multi-agent interactive domains. Despite existing guarantees on the performance of the resulting learned policies, characterizations of how far the learned polices are from a Nash equilibrium are missing for offline MA-IL. In this paper, we demonstrate impossibility and hardness results of learning low-exploitable policies in general $n$-player Markov Games. We do so by providing examples where even exact measure matching fails, and demonstrating a new hardness result on characterizing the Nash gap given a fixed measure matching error. We then show how these challenges can be overcome using strategic dominance assumptions on the expert equilibrium. Specifically, for the case of dominant strategy expert equilibria, assuming Behavioral Cloning error $ε_{\\text{BC}}$, this provides a Nash imitation gap of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(nε_{\\text{BC}}/(1-γ)^2\\right)$ for a discount factor $γ$. We generalize this result with a new notion of best-response continuity, and argue that this is implicitly encouraged by standard regularization techniques.",

    "content": "Report-supervised (RSuper) learning seeks to alleviate the need for dense tumor voxel labels with constraints derived from radiology reports (e.g., volumes, counts, sizes, locations). In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted. On 1238 report-labeled BraTS-MET/MEN scans, our MS-RSuper largely outperforms both a sparsely-supervised baseline and a naive RSuper method.",

    "content": "In engineering design and scientific computing, computational cost and predictive accuracy are intrinsically coupled. High-fidelity simulations provide accurate predictions but at substantial computational costs, while lower-fidelity approximations offer efficiency at the expense of accuracy. Multi-fidelity surrogate modelling addresses this trade-off by combining abundant low-fidelity data with sparse high-fidelity observations. However, existing methods suffer from expensive training cost or rely on global correlation assumptions that often fail in practice to capture how fidelity relationships vary across the input space, leading to poor performance particularly under tight budget constraints. We introduce MAST, a method that blends corrected low-fidelity observations with high-fidelity predictions, trusting high-fidelity near observed samples and relying on corrected low-fidelity elsewhere. MAST achieves this through explicit discrepancy modelling and distance-based weighting with closed-form variance propagation, producing a single heteroscedastic Gaussian process. Across multi-fidelity synthetic benchmarks, MAST shows a marked improvement over the current state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, MAST maintains robust performance across varying total budget and fidelity gaps, conditions under which competing methods exhibit significant degradation or unstable behaviour.",

    "content": "Bubeck and Sellke (2021) pose as an open problem the connection between the law of robustness and robust generalization. The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al. (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al. (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al. (2023). Informally, to obtain low robust generalization error, the Lipschitz constant must lie in a range that we bound, and the allowable perturbation radius is linked to the Lipschitz scale.",

This has opened up the potential for automating critical inspection tasks, which have traditionally only been trusted to be done manually. However, the application of binary classifiers in critical operations depends on the estimation of reliable confidence bounds such that system performance can be ensured up to a given statistical significance. We present Wilson Score Kernel Density Classification, which is a novel kernel-based method for estimating confidence bounds in binary classification. The core of our method is the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator, which is a function estimator for estimating confidence bounds in Binomial experiments with conditionally varying success probabilities. Our method is evaluated in the context of selective classification on four different datasets, illustrating its use as a classification head of any feature extractor, including vision foundation models. Our proposed method shows similar performance to Gaussian Process Classification, but at a lower computational complexity.",

    "content": "For millennia, human cognition was the primary engine of progress on Earth. As AI decouples cognition from biology, the marginal cost of measurable execution falls to zero, absorbing any labor capturable by metrics--including creative, analytical, and innovative work. The binding constraint on growth is no longer intelligence but human verification bandwidth: the capacity to validate, audit, and underwrite responsibility when execution is abundant. We model the AGI transition as the collision of two racing cost curves: an exponentially decaying Cost to Automate and a biologically bottlenecked Cost to Verify. This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify. It also drives a shift from skill-biased to measurability-biased technical change. Rents migrate to verification-grade ground truth, cryptographic provenance, and liability underwriting--the ability to insure outcomes rather than merely generate them. The current human-in-the-loop equilibrium is unstable: eroded from below as apprenticeship collapses (Missing Junior Loop) and from within as experts codify their obsolescence (Codifier's Curse). Unverified deployment becomes privately rational--a Trojan Horse externality. Unmanaged, these forces pull toward a Hollow Economy. Yet by scaling verification alongside agentic capabilities, the forces that threaten collapse become the catalyst for unbounded discovery and experimentation--an Augmented Economy. We derive a practical playbook for individuals, companies, investors, and policymakers. Today's defining challenge is not the race to deploy the most autonomous systems; it is the race to secure the foundations of their oversight. Only by scaling our bandwidth for verification alongside our capacity for execution can we ensure that the intelligence we have summoned preserves the humanity that initiated it.",

    "content": "Several variations of adaptive first-order and second-order optimization methods have been proposed to accelerate and scale the training of large language models. The performance of these optimization routines is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters (HPs), which are computationally expensive to tune for large-scale models. Maximal update parameterization $(μ$P$)$ is a set of scaling rules which aims to make the optimal HPs independent of the model size, thereby allowing the HPs tuned on a smaller (computationally cheaper) model to be transferred to train a larger, target model. Despite promising results for SGD and Adam, deriving $μ$P for other optimizers is challenging because the underlying tensor programming approach is difficult to grasp. Building on recent work that introduced spectral conditions as an alternative to tensor programs, we propose a novel framework to derive $μ$P for a broader class of optimizers, including AdamW, ADOPT, LAMB, Sophia, Shampoo and Muon. We implement our $μ$P derivations on multiple benchmark models and demonstrate zero-shot learning rate transfer across increasing model width for the above optimizers. Further, we provide empirical insights into depth-scaling parameterization for these optimizers.",

    "content": "An electroencephalogram (EEG) records the spatially averaged electrical activity of neurons in the brain, measured from the human scalp. Prior studies have explored EEG-based classification of objects or concepts, often for passive viewing of briefly presented image or video stimuli, with limited classes. Because EEG exhibits a low signal-to-noise ratio, recognizing fine-grained representations across a large number of classes remains challenging; however, abstract-level object representations may exist. In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.\n  We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction.",

The resulting bounds are of order $O(1/\\sqrt{S})$ with respect to the number of training samples $S$, and include a structure-dependent negative term, yielding depth-uniform and asymptotic generalization bounds under milder assumptions. These findings provide a unified understanding of generalization across both discrete- and continuous-time ResNets, helping to close the gap in both the order of sample complexity and assumptions between the discrete- and continuous-time settings.",

A common method is to freeze a pre-trained model and train a new, lightweight adapter for each task. While this prevents forgetting, it treats the learned knowledge as a simple, unstructured collection and fails to use the relationships between tasks. To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SAEF achieves SOTA performance.",

In this work, we introduce transcoder adapters, a technique for learning an interpretable approximation of the difference in MLP computation before and after fine-tuning. We apply transcoder adapters to characterize the differences between Qwen2.5-Math-7B and its reasoning-distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. Learned adapters are faithful to the target model's internal computation and next-token predictions. When evaluated on reasoning benchmarks, adapters match the reasoning model's response lengths and typically recover 50-90% of the accuracy gains from reasoning fine-tuning. Adapter features are sparsely activating and interpretable. When examining adapter features, we find that only ~8% have activating examples directly related to reasoning behaviors. We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens (e.g., \"wait\"). Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only ~2.4% of adapter features (5.6k total) performing one of two functions. These features are necessary and sufficient for producing hesitation tokens; removing them reduces response length, often without affecting accuracy. Overall, our results provide insight into reasoning training and suggest transcoder adapters may be useful for studying fine-tuning more broadly.",

    "content": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been increasingly applied in real-world scenarios due to their outstanding understanding and reasoning capabilities. Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

    "content": "We present Group Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (GOPO), a new alignment algorithm for large language models derived from the geometry of Hilbert function spaces. Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.",

However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN.",

In this paper, we start from the Original-DRESS equation (Castrillo, León, and Gómez, 2018) -- a parameter-free, continuous dynamical system on edges -- and show that it distinguishes the prism graph from $K_{3,3}$, a pair that 1-WL provably cannot separate. We then generalize it to Motif-DRESS, which replaces triangle neighborhoods with arbitrary structural motifs and converges to a unique fixed point under three sufficient conditions, and further to Generalized-DRESS, an abstract template parameterized by the choice of neighborhood operator, aggregation function and norm. Finally, we introduce $Δ$-DRESS, which runs DRESS on each node-deleted subgraph $G \\setminus \\{v\\}$, connecting the framework to the Kelly--Ulam reconstruction conjecture. Both Motif-DRESS and $Δ$-DRESS empirically distinguish Strongly Regular Graphs (SRGs) -- such as the Rook and Shrikhande graphs -- that confound 3-WL.

Traditional KL divergence tends to be dominated by the next tokens with the highest probabilities, i.e., the teacher's modes, thereby diminishing the influence of less probable yet potentially informative components of the output distribution. We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our modified distillation method yields competitive performance in both pre-training and supervised distillation of decoder models across various datasets. Furthermore, the distillation process is efficient and can be performed with a modest academic budget for large datasets, eliminating the need for industry-scale computing.",

While RL agents require extensive self-play games to extract useful signals, humans often need only a few games, improving rapidly by repeatedly revisiting states where mistakes occurred. This idea, known as search control, aims to restart from valuable states rather than always from the initial state. In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively. When training on a well-trained 9x9 Go model, RGSC further improves the win rate against KataGo from 69.3% to 78.2%, while both baselines show no improvement.

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress.

By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training.

    "content": "Rehearsal is one of the key techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting and has been widely adopted in continual learning algorithms due to its simplicity and practicality. However, the theoretical understanding of how rehearsal scale influences learning dynamics remains limited. To address this gap, we formulate rehearsal-based continual learning as a multidimensional effectiveness-driven iterative optimization problem, providing a unified characterization across diverse performance metrics. Within this framework, we derive a closed-form analysis of adaptability, memorability, and generalization from the perspective of rehearsal scale. Our results uncover several intriguing and counterintuitive findings. First, rehearsal can impair model's adaptability, in sharp contrast to its traditionally recognized benefits. Second, increasing the rehearsal scale does not necessarily improve memory retention. When tasks are similar and noise levels are low, the memory error exhibits a diminishing lower bound. Finally, we validate these insights through numerical simulations and extended analyses on deep neural networks across multiple real-world datasets, revealing statistical patterns of rehearsal mechanisms in continual learning.",

    "content": "The wide spread of new energy resources, smart devices, and demand side management strategies has motivated several analytics operations, from infrastructure load modeling to user behavior profiling. Energy Demand Forecasting (EDF) of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) is one of the most critical operations for ensuring efficient energy management and sustainability, since it enables utility providers to anticipate energy/power demand, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures to improve grid reliability. However, accurate EDF is a challenging problem due to external factors, such as the varying user routines, weather conditions, driving behaviors, unknown state of charge, etc. Furthermore, as concerns and restrictions about privacy and sustainability have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in distributed datasets scattered across different data silos and/or edge devices, calling for federated learning solutions. In this paper, we investigate different well-established time series forecasting methodologies to address the EDF problem, from statistical methods (the ARIMA family) to traditional machine learning models (such as XGBoost) and deep neural networks (GRU and LSTM). We provide an overview of these methods through a performance comparison over four real-world EVSE datasets, evaluated under both centralized and federated learning paradigms, focusing on the trade-offs between forecasting fidelity, privacy preservation, and energy overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate, on the one hand, the superiority of gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) over statistical and NN-based models in both prediction accuracy and energy efficiency and, on the other hand, an insight that Federated Learning-enabled models balance these factors, offering a promising direction for decentralized energy demand forecasting.",

Push-forward generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders and normalising flows offer a computationally efficient alternative for posterior sampling. However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation. Crucially, our design allows key model parameters to be specified at inference time, offering robustness to changes in the likelihood parameters. We train these unfolded samplers end-to-end using a supervised regularized Wasserstein GAN framework for posterior sampling. Through extensive Bayesian imaging experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves high sampling accuracy and excellent computational efficiency, while retaining the physics consistency, adaptability and interpretability of classical MCMC strategies.",

We present SibylSense, an inference-time learning approach that adapts a frozen rubric generator through a tunable memory bank of validated rubric items. Memory is updated via verifier-based item rewards measured by reference-candidate answer discriminative gaps from a handful of examples. SibylSense alternates memory tuning with a rubric-adversarial policy update that produces rubric-satisfying candidate answers, shrinking discriminative gaps and driving the rubric generator to capture new quality dimensions.

This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively.

We then evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds.

CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process, significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.",

S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.

Comparative analysis revealed S4's gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism.

PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.",

This necessitates Lipschitz constants scaling as $\\exp(Ω(R))$ to realize even simple hierarchical targets, yielding exponential sample complexity under capacity control. We then show this obstruction vanishes in hyperbolic space: constant-distortion hyperbolic embeddings admit $O(1)$-Lipschitz realizability, enabling learning with $n = O(mR \\log m)$ samples. A matching $Ω(mR \\log m)$ lower bound via Fano's inequality establishes that hyperbolic representations achieve the information-theoretic optimum.

Much of the graph matching literature is focused on anonymization thresholds in edge-independent noise settings, and we establish novel anonymization thresholds in this edge-dependent noise setting when matching $G_0$ and $G_t$. Moreover, we also compare this anonymization threshold with the mixing properties of the Markov chain noise model. We show that when $G_0$ is drawn from an Erdős-Rényi model, the graph matching anonymization threshold and the mixing time of the edgelighter walk are both of order $Θ(n^2\\log n)$. We further demonstrate that for more structured model for $G_0$ (e.g., the Stochastic Block Model), graph matching anonymization can occur in $O(n^α\\log n)$ time for some $α<2$, indicating that anonymization can occur before the Markov chain noise model globally mixes.

This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling.

Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the \"grokking time\") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.",

This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?\n  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class.

Recently, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC) has emerged as a promising estimand, offering quantile-level summaries akin to the conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) while preserving some interpretability of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). It achieves this by summarising the treated response conditional on both the covariates and the untreated response. Despite these desirable properties, the CQC's current estimation is limited by the need to first estimate the difference in conditional cumulative distribution functions and then invert it. This inversion obscures the CQC estimate, hampering our ability to both model and interpret it. To address this, we propose the first direct estimator of the CQC, allowing for explicit modelling and parameterisation. This explicit parameterisation enables better interpretation of our estimate while also providing a means to constrain and inform the model. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our estimation error depends directly on the complexity of the CQC itself, improving upon the existing estimation procedure. Furthermore, it retains the desirable double robustness property with respect to nuisance parameter estimation. We further show our method to outperform existing procedures in estimation accuracy across multiple data scenarios while varying sample size and nuisance error.

This work investigates their application to the numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows, with a view toward incorporating physical constraints such as incompressibility in the probabilistic forecasting framework enabled by generative networks. For that purpose, we explore different conditional, score-based diffusion models where the divergence-free constraint is imposed by the Leray spectral projector, and autoregressive conditioning is aimed at stabilizing the forecasted flow snapshots at distant time horizons. The proposed models are run on a benchmark turbulence problem, namely a Kolmogorov flow, which allows for a fairly detailed analytical and numerical treatment and thus simplifies the evaluation of the numerical methods used to simulate it. Numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to compare the advantages and limitations of the diffusion models we have implemented and appraise their performances, including: (i) in-distribution assessment over the same time horizons and for similar physical conditions as the ones seen during training; (ii) rollout predictions over time horizons unseen during training; and (iii) out-of-distribution tests for forecasting flows markedly different from those seen during training.

The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics.

In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to (i) establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and (ii) derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator.

Because policy learning is interventional, it induces two distinct fairness targets: action fairness (equitable action assignments) and outcome fairness (equitable downstream consequences). Crucially, equalizing actions does not generally equalize outcomes when groups face different constraints or respond differently to the same action. We propose a novel double fairness learning (DFL) framework that explicitly manages the trade-off among three objectives: action fairness, outcome fairness, and value maximization. We integrate fairness directly into a multi-objective optimization problem for policy learning and employ a lexicographic weighted Tchebyshev method that recovers Pareto solutions beyond convex settings, with theoretical guarantees on the regret bounds.

Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.\n  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.",

In this study, we propose JIMA, a joint interaction modeling approach that uses a single model to take advantage of all data from different levels of granularity and incorporate interactions to learn the complex relationships among lower-order (atomic item) and higher-order (composite item) user preferences as well as domain expertise (e.g., on the stylistic fit).

To exploit these similarities, recently Suresh et al., 2022, Jhunjhunwala et al., 2021, Jiang et al, 2023, proposed multiple correlation-aware compression schemes. However, in most cases, the correlations have to be known for these schemes to work. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of graceful degradation of these correlation-aware compression schemes with increasing dissimilarity is limited to only the $\\ell_2$-error in the literature. In this paper, we propose four different collaborative compression schemes that agnostically exploit the similarities among vectors in a distributed setting. Our schemes are all simple to implement and computationally efficient, while resulting in big savings in communication. The analysis of our proposed schemes show how the $\\ell_2$, $\\ell_\\infty$ and cosine estimation error varies with the degree of similarity among vectors.",

We provide an alternative using recent advances in statistical inference for gradient boosting, deriving methods for statistical inference as well as end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Using a moving average instead of a sum of trees (Boulevard regularization) allows the boosting process to converge to a feature-wise kernel ridge regression. This produces asymptotically normal predictions that achieve the minimax-optimal mean squared error for fitting Lipschitz GAMs with $p$ features at rate $O(pn^{-2/3})$, successfully avoiding the curse of dimensionality.

By operating directly on in-phase / quadrature samples, the CVAE preserves phase and Doppler structure and is assessed in two configurations: (i) using unprocessed range profiles and (ii) after local whitening, where per-range covariance estimates are obtained from neighboring profiles. Using extensive simulations together with real sea-clutter data from the CSIR maritime dataset, we benchmark performance against classical and adaptive detectors (MF, NMF, AMF-SCM, ANMF-SCM, ANMF-Tyler). In both configurations, the CVAE yields a higher detection probability Pd at matched false-alarm rate Pfa, with the most notable improvements observed under whitening. We further integrate the CVAE with the ANMF through a weighted log-p fusion rule at the decision level, attaining enhanced robustness in strongly non-Gaussian clutter and enabling empirically calibrated Pfa control under H0. Overall, the results demonstrate that statistical normalization combined with complex-valued generative modeling substantively improves detection in realistic sea-clutter conditions, and that the fused CVAE-ANMF scheme constitutes a competitive alternative to established model-based detectors.",

To aid such decisions, we propose a diagnostic tool for contrasting global regression models and patient-specific (local) regression models. The core utility of this tool is to identify where and for whom a global model may be inadequate. We focus on regression models and specifically suggest a localized regression approach that identifies regions in the predictor space where patients are not well represented by the global model. As localization becomes challenging when dealing with many predictors, we propose modeling in a dimension-reduced latent representation obtained from an autoencoder. Using such a neural network architecture for dimension reduction enables learning a latent representation simultaneously optimized for both good data reconstruction and for revealing local outcome-related associations suitable for robust localized regression. We illustrate the proposed approach with a clinical study involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings indicate that the global model is adequate for most patients but that indeed specific subgroups benefit from personalized models. We also demonstrate how to map these subgroup models back to the original predictors, providing insight into why the global model falls short for these groups. Thus, the principal application and diagnostic yield of our tool is the identification and characterization of patients or subgroups whose outcome associations deviate from the global model.",

This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error. This theorem provides a rigorous guarantee of universal expressivity, addressing key theoretical gaps in QML.

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.",

Rather than attempting to characterize the geometry of MVCs directly, this paper studies a practically motivated decision problem: given two observed multinomial outcomes, can one certify whether their MVCs intersect? We present a certified, tolerance-aware algorithm for this intersection problem. The method exploits the fact that likelihood ordering induces halfspace constraints in log-odds coordinates, enabling adaptive geometric partitioning of parameter space and computable lower and upper bounds on p-values over each cell. For three categories, this yields an efficient and provably sound algorithm that either certifies intersection, certifies disjointness, or returns an indeterminate result when the decision lies within a prescribed margin. We further show how the approach extends to higher dimensions.

In this data, factors correspond to clusters of genes which are co-expressed; we may expect some clusters (or biological pathways) to be active for all diseases, while some clusters are only active for a specific disease. To learn these factors, we consider a nonlinear multi-study factor model, which allows for both shared and specific factors. To fit this model, we propose a multi-study sparse variational autoencoder. The underlying model is sparse in that each observed feature (i.e. each dimension of the data) depends on a small subset of the latent factors. In the genomics example, this means each gene is active in only a few biological processes. Further, the model implicitly induces a penalty on the number of latent factors, which helps separate the shared factors from the group-specific factors.

    "content": "Task-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) prioritizes task execution over accurate symbol reconstruction and is well-suited to emerging intelligent applications. Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom.",

    "content": "Data-driven methods for the solution of inverse problems have become widely popular in recent years thanks to the rise of machine learning techniques. A popular approach concerns the training of a generative model on additional data to learn a bespoke prior for the problem at hand. In this article we present an analysis for such problems by presenting quantitative error bounds for minimum Wasserstein-2 generative models for the prior. We show that under some assumptions, the error in the posterior due to the generative prior will inherit the same rate as the prior with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance. We further present numerical experiments that verify that aspects of our error analysis manifests in some benchmarks followed by an elliptic PDE inverse problem where a generative prior is used to model a non-stationary field.",

    "content": "Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.",

    "content": "The grade of membership model is a flexible latent variable model for analyzing multivariate categorical data through individual-level mixed membership scores. In many modern applications, auxiliary covariates are collected alongside responses and encode information about the same latent structure. Traditional approaches to incorporating such covariates typically rely on fully specified joint likelihoods, which are computationally intensive and sensitive to misspecification. We introduce a covariate-assisted grade of membership model that integrates response and covariate information by exploiting their shared low-rank simplex geometry, rather than modeling their joint distribution. We propose a likelihood-free spectral estimation procedure that combines heterogeneous data sources through a balance parameter controlling their relative contribution. To accommodate high-dimensional and heteroskedastic noise, we employ heteroskedastic principal component analysis before performing simplex-based geometric recovery. Our theoretical analysis establishes weaker identifiability conditions than those required in the covariate-free model, and further derives finite-sample, entrywise error bounds for both mixed membership scores and item parameters. These results demonstrate that auxiliary covariates can provably improve latent structure recovery, yielding faster convergence rates in high-dimensional regimes. Simulation studies and an application to educational assessment data illustrate the computational efficiency, statistical accuracy, and interpretability gains of the proposed method.

These estimators rely exclusively on dataset-specific summary statistics, thereby avoiding the pooling of subject-level data and remaining applicable in privacy-restricted or decentralized settings. We establish, for the first time, a theoretical connection between O-TL and CVS-based TL, showing that these two seemingly distinct TL strategies adjust local estimators in fundamentally similar ways. We further derive convergence rates that explicitly account for the unavoidable but typically overlooked smoothing error arising from discretely observed functional predictors, and clarify how similarity among covariance functions across datasets governs the performance of TL.

    "content": "Multimarginal optimal transport (MOT) has gained increasing attention in recent years, notably due to its relevance in machine learning and statistics, where one seeks to jointly compare and align multiple probability distributions. This paper presents a unified and complete Kantorovich duality theory for MOT problem on general Polish product spaces with bounded continuous cost function. For marginal compact spaces, the duality identity is derived through a convex-analytic reformulation, that identifies the dual problem as a Fenchel-Rockafellar conjugate. We obtain dual attainment and show that optimal potentials may always be chosen in the class of $c$-conjugate families, thereby extending classical two-marginal conjugacy principle into a genuinely multimarginal setting. In non-compact setting, where direct compactness arguments are unavailable, we recover duality via a truncation-tightness procedure based on weak compactness of multimarginal transference plans and boundedness of the cost. We prove that the dual value is preserved under restriction to compact subsets and that admissible dual families can be regularized into uniformly bounded $c$-conjugate potentials. The argument relies on a refined use of $c$-splitting sets and their equivalence with multimarginal $c$-cyclical monotonicity. We then obtain dual attainment and exact primal-dual equality for MOT on arbitrary Polish spaces, together with a canonical representation of optimal dual potentials by $c$-conjugacy. These results provide a structural foundation for further developments in probabilistic and statistical analysis of MOT, including stability, differentiability, and asymptotic theory under marginal perturbations.",

    "content": "We develop a data-driven information-theoretic framework for sharp partial identification of causal effects under unmeasured confounding. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as bounded or discrete outcomes; require external inputs (for example, instrumental variables, proxies, or user-specified sensitivity parameters); necessitate full structural causal model specifications; or focus solely on population-level averages while neglecting covariate-conditional effects. We overcome all four limitations simultaneously by establishing novel information-theoretic, data-driven divergence bounds. Our key theoretical contribution shows that the f-divergence between the observational distribution P(Y | A = a, X = x) and the interventional distribution P(Y | do(A = a), X = x) is upper bounded by a function of the propensity score alone. This result enables sharp partial identification of conditional causal effects directly from observational data, without requiring external sensitivity parameters, auxiliary variables, full structural specifications, or outcome boundedness assumptions. For practical implementation, we develop a semiparametric estimator satisfying Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which ensures root-n consistent inference even when nuisance functions are estimated via flexible machine learning methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications, implemented in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yonghanjung/Information-Theretic-Bounds), demonstrate that our framework provides tight and valid causal bounds across a wide range of data-generating processes.",

These exposes highlight the need to identify when algorithms predict unintended quantities - ideally before deploying them into consequential settings. We propose a falsification framework that provides a principled statistical test for discriminant validity: the requirement that an algorithm predict intended outcomes better than impermissible ones. Drawing on falsification practices from causal inference, econometrics, and psychometrics, our framework compares calibrated prediction losses across outcomes to assess whether the algorithm exhibits discriminant validity with respect to a specified impermissible proxy. In settings where the target outcome is difficult to observe, multiple permissible proxy outcomes may be available; our framework accommodates both this setting and the case with a single permissible proxy. Throughout we use nonparametric hypothesis testing methods that make minimal assumptions on the data-generating process. We illustrate the method in an admissions setting, where the framework establishes discriminant validity with respect to gender but fails to establish discriminant validity with respect to race. This demonstrates how falsification can serve as an early validity check, prior to fairness or robustness analyses. We also provide analysis in a criminal justice setting, where we highlight the limitations of our framework and emphasize the need for complementary approaches to assess other aspects of construct validity and external validity.",

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale.

In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks.

In the first regime, i.e., when $p=o(n^{2/3})$, we show how the estimated prior can be calibrated to enable valid coordinate-wise and delocalized inference, both under the \\emph{empirical Bayes posterior} and the oracle posterior.

Yet, a robust framework to quantify local model errors is still lacking. While the local uncertainty of PCE prediction can be captured using bootstrap resampling, other methods offering more rigorous statistical guarantees are needed, especially in the context of small training datasets. Recently, conformal predictions have demonstrated strong potential in machine learning, providing statistically robust and model-agnostic prediction intervals. Due to its generality and versatility, conformal prediction is especially valuable, as it can be adapted to suit a variety of problems, making it a compelling choice for PCE-based surrogate models. In this contribution, we explore its application to PCE-based surrogate models. More precisely, we present the integration of two conformal prediction methods, namely the full conformal and the Jackknife+ approaches, into both full and sparse PCEs. For full PCEs, we introduce computational shortcuts inspired by the inherent structure of regression methods to optimize the implementation of both conformal methods. For sparse PCEs, we incorporate the two approaches with appropriate modifications to the inference strategy, thereby circumventing the non-symmetrical nature of the regression algorithm and ensuring valid prediction intervals. Our developments yield better-calibrated prediction intervals for both full and sparse PCEs, achieving superior coverage over existing approaches, such as the bootstrap, while maintaining a moderate computational cost.",

We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines.",

We investigate this using the Spanish \\emph{L-shaped morphome}, where only the first-person singular indicative (e.g., \\textit{pongo} `I put') shares its stem with all subjunctive forms (e.g., \\textit{ponga, pongas}) despite lacking apparent phonological, semantic, or syntactic motivation. We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern. Humans do the opposite, generalizing preferentially to the first-person singular indicative over subjunctive forms. None of the models reproduce the human pattern, highlighting the gap between statistical pattern reproduction and morphological abstraction.",

To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions.

GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen.

We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks.

Pashto, spoken by more than 60 million people, has historically lacked large-scale openly licensed speech data suitable for modern ASR development.\n  This paper presents a release-level analysis of the Pashto component of the Mozilla Common Voice corpus, focusing on version 24.0 (December 2025) and contextualizing trends across major releases. We document rapid growth from 1.49 recorded hours in mid-2023 to 2,768.7 total hours in 2025, including 975.89 validated hours available for supervised ASR training.\n  Beyond scale, we analyze validation throughput, contributor participation inequality, demographic metadata completeness, and sentence-level concentration in the validated subset. We find that participation is extremely concentrated (Gini = 0.941), age representation is strongly skewed toward young adults, and 41.97\\% of clips lack self-reported gender labels, limiting subgroup auditing based on metadata. At the textual level, prompt reuse is moderate: 35.88\\% of unique sentences account for 50\\% of validated clips, suggesting that structural concentration is driven primarily by uneven contributor activity rather than dominance of a small prompt set.\n  These results provide a quantitative audit of a rapidly scaling low-resource speech corpus and highlight practical priorities for improving dataset maturity, including expanded validation capacity and broader demographic participation.",

    "content": "We introduce LM-Lexicon, an innovative definition modeling approach that incorporates data clustering, semantic expert learning, and model merging using a sparse mixture-of-experts architecture. By decomposing the definition modeling task into specialized semantic domains, where small language models are trained as domain experts, LM-Lexicon achieves substantial improvements (+7% BLEU score compared with the prior state-of-the-art model) over existing methods on five widely used benchmarks. Empirically, we demonstrate that 1) the clustering strategy enables fine-grained expert specialization with nearly 10% improvement in definition quality; 2) the semantic-aware domain-level routing mechanism achieves higher expert efficacy (+1%) than conventional token-level routing; and 3) further performance gains can be obtained through test-time compute and semantic expert scaling.

Existing Test Time Scaling (TTS) methods, including structured tree search, have made progress in exploring reasoning paths but still face two major challenges: (1) underthinking, where reasoning chains tend to be shallow and fail to capture the full complexity of problems; and (2) overthinking, where overly verbose reasoning leads to inefficiency and increased computational costs. To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogitsCoder produces more efficient and higher-quality reasoning chains, leading to superior code generation performance compared to baseline methods.",

    "content": "Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities across diverse tasks, yet their performance on extended contexts remains inconsistent. While prior research has emphasized mid-context degradation in question answering, this study examines the impact of context in LLM-based fact verification. Using three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and ClimateFEVER) and five open-source models accross different parameters sizes (7B, 32B and 70B parameters) and model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5 and Qwen3), we evaluate both parametric factual knowledge and the impact of evidence placement across varying context lengths. We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.",

This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures.",

We identify that standard Scalar Quality Metrics (SQM) fall short in this context; by evaluating candidates in isolation, they lack the comparative context necessary to distinguish fine-grained linguistic nuances. To address this, we introduce the Group Quality Metric (GQM) paradigm and instantiate it via the Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM). Unlike traditional independent scorers, GRRM processes the entire candidate group jointly, leveraging comparative analysis to rigorously resolve relative quality and adaptive granularity. Empirical evaluations confirm that GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy among all baselines. Building on this foundation, we integrate GRRM into the GRPO training loop to optimize the translation policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only improves general translation quality but also unlocks reasoning capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method.",

In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category.

    "content": "Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) has become a widely used benchmark for evaluating frontier large language models on challenging, multi-domain questions. However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities.

Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny.",

LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces.

Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step.

However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \\benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill.",

    "content": "This study examines the acquisition of English irregular inflections by Yemeni learners of English as a second language (L2), utilizing a Universal Grammar (UG) approach. Within the UG approach, the study considers Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (FRH) (Lardiere, 2008, 2009) part of UG, focusing on the roles of first language (L1) transfer and L2 developmental influence. It analyzes learner errors across two developmental stages. Stage 1 data reveal a dominant influence of L1 transfer, particularly in phonological and structural mismatches, while stage 2 data demonstrate increased learner sensitivity to UG properties and morphological reconfiguration toward the target language. Findings reveal that errors in irregular inflectional morphology are attributed to both interlingual and intralingual sources, with overgeneralization of L2 rules as a common developmental strategy. Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners' continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access. The study concludes that while L1 transfer and L2 developmental factors influence initial stages of acquisition, appropriate linguistic input and instruction are critical for facilitating UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners.",

However, most patients worldwide lack access to timely expert consensus, particularly in resource-constrained centres where MDT resources are scarce or unavailable. Here we present OMGs (Ovarian tumour Multidisciplinary intelligent aGent System), a multi-agent AI framework where domain-specific agents deliberate collaboratively to integrate multidisciplinary evidence and generate MDT-style recommendations with transparent rationales. To systematically evaluate MDT recommendation quality, we developed SPEAR (Safety, Personalization, Evidence, Actionability, Robustness) and validated OMGs across diverse clinical scenarios spanning the care continuum. In multicentre re-evaluation, OMGs achieved performance comparable to expert MDT consensus ($4.45 \\pm 0.30$ versus $4.53 \\pm 0.23$), with higher Evidence scores (4.57 versus 3.92). In prospective multicentre evaluation (59 patients), OMGs demonstrated high concordance with routine MDT decisions. Critically, in paired human-AI studies, OMGs most substantially enhanced clinicians' recommendations in Evidence and Robustness, the dimensions most compromised when multidisciplinary expertise is unavailable. These findings suggest that multi-agent deliberative systems can achieve performance comparable to expert MDT consensus, with potential to expand access to specialized oncology expertise in resource-limited settings.",

Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.",

A usage-based approach examining how word senses map to signs can identify such novel mappings absent from current dictionaries, enriching lexicographic resources. We address this by analyzing German and German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS), manually annotating 1,404 word use-to-sign ID mappings derived from 32 words from the German Word Usage Graph (D-WUG) and 49 signs from the Digital Dictionary of German Sign Language (DW-DGS).

SS substantially outperforms EM overall 88.52% vs. 71.31%), with dramatic gains for Type 1 (+52.1 pp).

    "content": "Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) aims to identify events and their arguments from documents that contain both text and images. It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities.

While LLMs can detect surface-level similarity, they often fail to capture the pragmatic functions of rephrasing, such as its role within rhetorical discourse. This paper presents a comparative multi-agent framework designed to quantify the benefits of incorporating explicit theoretical knowledge for this task. We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\\%. Our findings provide evidence that theoretical grounding is not only beneficial but essential for advancing beyond mere paraphrase detection towards function-aware analysis of argumentative discourse.

    "content": "Metaphors are a distinctive feature of literary language, yet they remain less studied experimentally than everyday metaphors. Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult (i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity) in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier (i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity) in today's nonliterary language (e.g., the Web) than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Web's language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible.",

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.",

    "content": "Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism.

However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning.

We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically.

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), federated fine-tuning of generative LLMs has gained attention as a way to leverage distributed data while preserving confidentiality. However, this setting introduces fundamental challenges: (i) privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) due to LLM memorization, and (ii) a persistent tension between global generalization and local utility under heterogeneous data. Existing defenses, such as data sanitization and differential privacy, reduce leakage but often degrade downstream performance. We propose SecureGate, a privacy-aware federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs that provides fine-grained privacy control without sacrificing utility. SecureGate employs a dual-adapter LoRA architecture: a secure adapter that learns sanitized, globally shareable representations, and a revealing adapter that captures sensitive, organization-specific knowledge. A token-controlled gating module selectively activates these adapters at inference time, enabling controlled information disclosure without retraining. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that SecureGate improves task utility while substantially reducing PII leakage, achieving up to a 31.66X reduction in inference attack accuracy and a 17.07X reduction in extraction recall for unauthorized requests.

In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes.",

    "content": "The rapid integration of large language models into newsroom workflows has raised urgent questions about the prevalence of AI-generated content in online media. While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to move beyond self-reported journalist perceptions toward empirical, data-driven measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media.",

    "content": "The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed.",

    "content": "The rise of digital technology has dramatically increased the potential for cyberbullying and online abuse, necessitating enhanced measures for detection and prevention, especially among children. This study focuses on detecting abusive obfuscated language in Swahili, a low-resource language that poses unique challenges due to its limited linguistic resources and technological support. Swahili is chosen due to its popularity and being the most widely spoken language in Africa, with over 16 million native speakers and upwards of 100 million speakers in total, spanning regions in East Africa and some parts of the Middle East.\n  We employed machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, optimized through rigorous parameter tuning and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. Our analysis revealed that, while these models perform well in high-dimensional textual data, our dataset's small size and imbalance limit our findings' generalizability. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were thoroughly analyzed, highlighting the nuanced performance of each model in detecting obfuscated language.\n  This research contributes to the broader discourse on ensuring safer online environments for children, advocating for expanded datasets and advanced machine-learning techniques to improve the effectiveness of cyberbullying detection systems. Future work will focus on enhancing data robustness, exploring transfer learning, and integrating multimodal data to create more comprehensive and culturally sensitive detection mechanisms.",

However, their suitability for high-stakes crisis contexts remains insufficiently evaluated. This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks.",

    "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in scientific domains like retrosynthesis; yet, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary to navigate complex problem spaces without error. A critical challenge is directing an LLM to avoid specific, chemically sensitive sites on a molecule - a task where unconstrained generation can lead to invalid or undesirable synthetic pathways. In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy.",

    "content": "The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.",

    "content": "Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.",

    "content": "LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly capable, yet their safety lags behind. This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-realistic settings, we propose a principled taxonomy that transforms single-turn harmful tasks into multi-turn attack sequences. Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment. Experiments show that ToolShield effectively reduces ASR by 30% on average in multi-turn interactions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CHATS-lab/ToolShield.",

    "content": "Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",

In this work we extend the OpenLID classifier by adding more training data, merging problematic language variant clusters, and introducing a special label for marking noise. We call this extended system OpenLID-v3 and evaluate it against GlotLID on multiple benchmarks. During development, we focus on three groups of closely related languages (Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; Romance varieties of Northern Italy and Southern France; and Scandinavian languages) and contribute new evaluation datasets where existing ones are inadequate. We find that ensemble approaches improve precision but also substantially reduce coverage for low-resource languages. OpenLID-v3 is available on https://huggingface.co/HPLT/OpenLID-v3.",

While some of these pressures are universal across languages and cultures, others differ depending on the social and conversational context: language use in newspapers is subject to very different constraints than language use on social media. Prior distributional semantic work on English word emergence (neology) identified two factors correlated with creation of new words by analyzing a corpus consisting primarily of historical published texts (Ryskina et al., 2020, arXiv:2001.07740). Extending this methodology to contextual embeddings in addition to static ones and applying it to a new corpus of Twitter posts, we show that the same findings hold for both domains, though the topic popularity growth factor may contribute less to neology on Twitter than in published writing. We hypothesize that this difference can be explained by the two domains favouring different neologism formation mechanisms.",

Their harmonic mean, $\\text{F1}{\\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.",

    "content": "Show HN: Tomoshibi – A writing app where your words fade by firelight. I spent ten years trying to write a novel. Every time I sat down, I&#x27;d write a sentence, decide it wasn&#x27;t good enough, and rewrite it.<p>The problem wasn&#x27;t discipline — it was that I could always see what I&#x27;d written and go back to change it.<p>I tried other approaches. Apps that delete your words when you stop typing — they fight fear with fear. That just made me panic. I wanted the opposite: not punishment, but permission.<p>&quot;Tomoshibi&quot; is Japanese for a small light in the dark — just enough to see what&#x27;s in front of you.<p>You write on a dark screen. Older lines fade, but not when you hit return. They fade when you start writing again. If you pause, they wait. You can edit the current line and one line back — enough to fix a typo, not enough to spiral. The one-line-back rule also catches my own  practical issue: Japanese IME often fires an accidental newline on kanji confirmation.<p>Everything is saved. There&#x27;s a separate reader view for going back through what you&#x27;ve written. Tomoshibi is for writing over months, not just one session. When you come back, your last sentence appears as an epigraph — as if it always belonged there.<p>No account, no server, no build step. Your writing stays in your browser&#x27;s local storage — export anytime as .txt. Vanilla HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;ES modules.<p>Try it in your browser. A native Mac app (built with Tauri) with file system integration is coming to the store.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing on it for two months.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomoshibi.in-hakumei.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomoshibi.in-hakumei.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;</a>",
