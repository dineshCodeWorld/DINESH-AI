    "text": "Christiaan Hendrik Persoon 31 December 1761  16 November 1836 was a Cape Colony mycologist who is recognized as one of the founders of mycological taxonomy.  Early life  Persoon was born in Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope, the third child of an immigrant Pomeranian father, Christiaan Daniel Persoon, and Dutch mother, Wilhelmina Elizabeth Groenwald. His mother died soon after he was born. In 1775, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to Europe for his education. His father died a year later in 1776.  Education  Initially a student of theology at Halle, Persoon switched his studies to medicine, which he pursued in Leiden and then Göttingen. He received a doctorate from the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher in Erlangen 1799.  Later years  He moved to Paris by 1803, where he spent the rest of his life, renting the upper floor of a house in a poor part of town. He was apparently unemployed, unmarried, poverty-stricken and a recluse, although he corresponded with botanists throughout Europe. Because of his financial difficulties, Persoon agreed to donate his herbarium to the House of Orange, in return for an adequate pension for life.  Academic career  The origin of Persoons botanical interest is unknown. The earliest of his works was Abbildungen der Schwämme Illustrations of the fungi, published in three parts, in 1790, 1791, and 1793. In 1794, Persoon introduced the term lirella for the furrowed ascomata of the lichen genus Graphis. From 1805 to 1807, he published two volumes of his Synopsis plantarum Archived 20 May 2011 at the Wayback Machine, a popular work describing 20,000 species of all types of plants. But his pioneering work was in the fungi, for which he published several works, beginning with the Synopsis methodica fungorum 1801; it is the starting point for nomenclature of the Uredinales, Ustilaginales, and the Gasteromycetes. Persoon described many polypore species; most were from his own collections in central Europe, while several other tropical species were sent to him from collections made by French botanist Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré during his circumglobal expedition. These latter fungi are among the first tropical polypores ever described. In 1815, Persoon was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Persoon was a prolific author of new fungal species, having formally described 2269 in his career.  Recognition  The genus Persoonia, a variety of small Australian trees and shrubs, was named after him. The title Persoonia is also given to a biannual scientific journal of molecular phylogeny and evolution of fungi, published jointly by the National Herbarium of the Netherlands and the CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre.

First described by Albert Günther in 1877 as Leuciscus hakonensis, it was the type specimen of the genus Tribolodon, having been described again as Tribolodon punctatum by Henri Émile Sauvage when he established that genus in 1883. It is the most widely distributed of the Pseudaspius species, found over much of the Sea of Japan. It is known to carry a number of parasites, including the trematode species Centrocestus armatus for which it is a second intermediate host, and the copepod species Ergasilus fidiformis, which is carried in the fishs gills.  Fishing  Dace are a popular sport fish species. They are known to put up a fight, and to be good for eating. They can be caught with a variety of methods, including float fishing, lure fishing, and legering. Fly fishing for dace using patterns that imitate small fry or invertebrates can be successful. Dace grow to around 50 cm 20 in and 2.3 kg 5 lb or more, but the most common size caught are around 30 cm 1 ft and 450 g 1 lb or less and anything over 40 cm 16 in and 900 g 2 lb is considered a prize catch.

    "text": "Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland v. Liam Adams was a criminal case relating to allegations of child abuse made in 2009 against Liam Adams, brother of Irish politician Gerry Adams. Liam Adams was found guilty in October 2013 of 10 offences, and was sentenced in November 2013 to 16 years in prison.  UTV Insight Special  In December 2009, a UTV Insight Special programme alleged that Liam Adams had sexually abused his daughter, Áine Tyrell, for a decade. In response, his brother Gerry Adams urged Liam to turn himself in to the police. Gerry also alleged that his deceased father, Gerry Adams, Sr., had subjected family members to emotional, physical and sexual abuse. The Police Service of Northern Ireland issued a European Arrest Warrant for Liam Adams arrest.  Extradition request  In December 2009, Liam Adams presented himself at a Garda Síochána police station in Sligo. They were not able to arrest him as they did not have the necessary European Arrest Warrant. Adams did not wish to hand himself into police in Northern Ireland, citing unfairness. On 3 March 2010, the High Court in Dublin endorsed the European Arrest Warrant, which was issued in Liam Adams name by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The following day, Adams handed himself over to the authorities in the Republic. Adams opposed his extradition. At a brief hearing on 21 July, Adams applied for legal aid to help fight the extradition. On 3 October 2011, an Irish High Court judge in Dublin declined Liam Adams objections to the extradition request and said he would issue an order for Adams to surrender to the authorities in Northern Ireland. On 18 October 2011, after losing his appeal against extradition, Adams was remanded in custody for 15 days to a Dublin prison. He was handed over to officers from the PSNI at the border on the night of 2 November, and brought to Laganside Magistrates Court on the morning of 3 November, where he was remanded in custody for a week.  Trials  There were two trials; the first collapsed in April 2013 for legal reasons.  Verdict  In October 2013 Liam Adams was found guilty of ten offences, including rape and gross indecency committed against his daughter between 1977 and 1983 when she was four to nine. On 27 November 2013, Adams was jailed for 16 years with a further two years probation. He died in prison 25 February 2019.  References",

    "text": "David Barry Kitson born 21 January 1980 is an English former professional footballer. Kitson began his career with non-league Hitchin Town and Arlesey Town before he joined Cambridge United in 2001 and became one of the brightest prospects in the Third Division, which led to him being signed by Reading in 2003 for a fee of 150,000. He was part of Readings Championship title winning team that gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time in 2006, with a record 106 points. After two seasons in the top flight Reading were relegated and Kitson signed for Stoke City for a club record fee of 5.5 million. He had loan spells with Reading and Middlesbrough before joining Portsmouth. He spent two seasons at Fratton Park but his contract with Portsmouth was cancelled in August 2012 with the club in danger of being liquidated, and he subsequently joined Sheffield United on a short term deal, before signing a two-year contract at Oxford United in June 2013.  Playing career   Cambridge United  After playing non-league football for Hitchin Town and Arlesey Town, Kitson joined Cambridge United, then in Division Two, in 2001 after being recommended by agent Barry Silkman to Us manager John Beck. He made his debut in 32 victory away over Stoke City on 17 March 2001. On the final day of the same season, Kitson notched his first goal for the club in a 11 draw at Swansea City. The following season saw the club relegated from League One but Kitson scored 10 goals, finishing as the clubs second-top goalscorer, one behind Tom Youngs. In the 200203 season, Kitson scored 25 goals, falling two goals short of David Crowns club record of 27 goals in a season. After 11 goals in 19 appearances at the start of the 200304 season, Kitson left to join Reading, having scored 47 goals in 123 appearances in all competitions for Cambridge.  Reading  Kitson was sold to Reading on 26 December 2003, for a fee of 150,000. He scored five goals in 10 starts in his first season. In the 200506 season, despite injury he went on to record an impressive goals-to-game ratio, and continued to do so as Reading won the Championship title with a record 106 points. Following promotion with Reading, Kitson scored the clubs first Premier League goal in their 32 home win against Middlesbrough on the opening day of the 200607 season, but was then badly injured later in the same match. The injury kept him out of the game until Readings FA Cup victory over Birmingham City on 27 January 2007. On 27 March 2007, he committed his future to Reading, signing a new deal until June 2010. In Readings first Premier League game of the 200708 season, Kitson was sent off less than a minute after coming on as a substitute against Manchester United at Old Trafford, for a challenge on Patrice Evra.  Stoke City  On 18 July 2008, Kitson moved in a 5.5m move from Reading to Stoke City, breaking Stokes record transfer fee. Speculation soon arose as to whether Kitson was settled at Stoke, as he struggled to adapt to the sides style of play after being played out of position by manager Tony Pulis. As a result, he failed to score any goals in any of the 18 competitive games he played for Stoke City in the 200809 season. Chairman Peter Coates and Pulis denied any rumour that he might be leaving the Britannia Stadium. He rejoined Reading on loan until the end of the 200809 season on 10 March 2009. Kitson later revealed that he made the wrong decision in joining Stoke, adding that he and his family were happy at Reading and that I threw all of that away for what I thought was going to be a new challenge... I hold my hands up  it was my fault. I made the decision to go to Stoke, I didnt have to, no-one forced me to go, and it was a bad decision. Addressing his lack of goals for Stoke, he said Id been bought for a lot of money but I wasnt sure I was being utilised in the way I thought I was going to be... You do have some days at training when you go back in and wonder what youre doing there. However, Reading failed to gain promotion, meaning that Kitson returned to Stoke. Kitson stated that he would start his Stoke career again. His first competitive goal for Stoke came in a 10 League Cup win at Leyton Orient on 26 August 2009. He scored his first league goal for Stoke on 29 August 2009, which proved to be the winning goal against Sunderland and then scored again with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. However Kitson lost his place to James Beattie and joined Middlesbrough on a two-month loan. He scored his first goals for Middlesbrough when he scored a brace against Peterborough United on 28 November 2009. He returned to Stoke on 1 January 2010. He scored in the FA Cup against Manchester City and Bolton Wanderers.  Portsmouth  Kitson joined Portsmouth with Liam Lawrence on deadline day as part of a deal which saw Marc Wilson join Stoke City.

    "text": "The Komast cup also Comast cup is a cup shape at the beginning of the development of Attic drinking cups. Komast cups were widespread especially in Ionia and Corinth. Like other vase painters of the time, the Attic painters were under strong influence from Corinthian vase painting. The name is derived from the artists preferred theme, the kōmos, a ritualistic drunken procession performed by revelers in ancient Greece, whose participants were known as komasts κωμασταί, kōmastaí. This is a motif closely connected with Etruscan vase painting. The typical hemispherical shape with an angled offset lip and a low foot of only 12 centimetres 0.40.8 in height was an Attic development. The interior of the cups is black, only a narrow stripe or band below the lip is left in the base clay colour. The foot and the exterior of the handles are also black. The first specimens were quite large, but throughout the period of their production, the cups became gradually smaller. The most important painters of Komast cups formed the so-called Comast Group, with the KX Painter as its most significant member.  References   Bibliography  Thomas Mannack: Griechische Vasenmalerei.

The name comes from the famous Allatini flourmills founded by the Allatini family in the late 19th century. Moses Allatini operated a roller mill and pottery; his sons founded the Fratelli Allatini company. In 1854 they built the first steam mill in Thessaloniki, together with Darblay de Corblay; they acquired the whole property in 1882. The present-day central building of the Mills was constructed in 1898 according to plans by Vitaliano Poselli after the previous building burnt down. It was inaugurated on 19 September 1900. The building complex includes the administration building old residence, warehouses, refrigeration areas and the roller mill building, surrounded by the boiler room, the machine shop and the chimney of Belgian construction. The Allatini Mills was considered one of the largest, if not the largest, industrial buildings in the Orient, and Posellis most impressive work. The historical complex, an example of industrial archeology, remains abandoned and awaiting redevelopment. It is characterized as historical scheduled monument and there are various plans for its restoration. The new Allatini industrial facilities are located in Sindos.  Notes",

    "text": "The Clandestine Colombian Communist Party in Spanish: Partido Comunista Clandestino Colombiano was an underground communist party in Colombia. It was politically linked to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC, which founded the party in 2000. After FARC officially broke with the Colombian Communist Party CCP, a separate FARC-based party structure came into de facto existence during most of the 1990s, until the PCCC was officially founded in 2000. The partys founder and leader was FARCs commander Guillermo León Sáenz, also known as Alfonso Cano, who was killed in action in 2011.  History  As a result of peace negotiations between FARC and the Colombian government in 1985, FARC, in conjunction with the Colombian Communist Party, founded the Patriotic Union UP as a legal political party that would participate in electoral politics. Although the formation of the UP was a provision of the negotiations with the government, the party was violently repressed by right-wing paramilitary groups as well as Colombian drug lords. Whatever optimism FARC held regarding entrance into mainstream politics was slowly abandoned as the UP all but disintegrated in the late-1980s. Because FARC maintained a rigid ideology, they informally maintained a party structure known as the Bolivarian Movement for a New Colombia in the 1990s. This new emphasis on the figure of Simon Bolivar would later be incorporated into the official ideology of the PCCC. After the end of the Cold War, FARC would not abandon their ideological devotion to MarxismLeninism but they did complement it with nationalist Bolivarian sentiment. The transformation of this movement into the founding of the PCCC was officially announced by FARC in 2000. With the creation of the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force after the Colombian peace process, the party was disbanded, with its members joining the newly established political party.  Ideology  In adherence with Leninism, FARC did not intend for the PCCC to run in bourgeois elections. Instead, the PCCC was to remain underground, serving as the vanguard party for the FARC. As well as keeping the FARC rooted in MarxismLeninism, the PCCC also sought to appeal to other members of the working class in hopes of building a revolutionary class consciousness in Colombia. The existence of an official ideological organ of FARC also helped the organization to legitimize itself as a viable alternative to bourgeois democracy.

He is the younger brother of Kenenisa Bekele, who is also an accomplished long-distance runner and a former world record holder in both the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres. Tariku is the fourth fastest Ethiopian ever over 5,000 m and 3,000 metres. His indoor 3,000 m best of 7:31.09 ranks him as the ninth fastest of all-time in the event. He was the 10,000 m bronze medallist at the 2012 Summer Olympics. His first major victory came at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where he won the 3,000 m gold medal. He was the 2006 World Junior Champion over the distance and also won a cross country junior bronze medal that year. He took a continental silver medal at the 2007 All-Africa Games. Tariku has finished in the top eight of 5,000 m finals at the 2008 Summer Olympics and at the World Championships in Athletics in 2005 and 2007.  Running career  Following the footsteps of his older brother, he first had success at the younger levels of the sport. He won the 3000 m silver medal behind Augustine Choge at the 2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics and stepped up a distance to take the bronze medal over 5000 m at the 2004 World Junior Championships a year later. He beat Paul Tergat in the 2004 Oeiras International Cross Country meeting. He made his senior global debut at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics and finished in seventh place in the 5000 m, just ahead of his more experienced compatriot Dejene Berhanu. He ran the 3000 m at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships, finishing in sixth place. Building upon his successes on the track, he was third in the junior race at the 2006 IAAF World Cross Country Championships while his brother Kenenisa won both senior races. Tariku became the 5000 m junior champion at the 2006 World Junior Championships and was fourth over the distance at the 2006 IAAF World Athletics Final. He took the 3000 m gold at the World Final, however, having also run the third fastest 3000 m time of the season 7:29.11 in a second-place performance behind Isaac Kiprono Songok at the Rieti Meeting. His main focus of the 2007 season was on the 5000 m and he won the silver medal at the 2007 All-Africa Games before going on to take fifth place at the 2007 World Championships over the distance  the best performance by an Ethiopian at the competition. He ascended to the top of his event at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships by winning the indoor 3000 m title at the age of 21  succeeding his brother as the champion in the event. He made his Olympic debut at the 2008 Beijing Games and was sixth over 5000 m. Among other competitions, he competed at the 2008 IAAF World Athletics Final that year, also finishing in sixth. He attempted to defend his world title at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, but it was not to be and he finished in fourth place as Bernard Lagat succeeded him as the 3000 m champion.

He set a world-leading time in the 3000 m at the 2010 Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, running 7:28.70 to finish .30 seconds ahead of Bernard Lagat who set an American record. The 2010 IAAF Continental Cup presented another opportunity as he was selected to represent Africa over 3000 m. Just as had happened indoors, he was fourth and out of the medals while Lagat took the honours. Tariku took to the roads at the end of the track season, competing at the 10-mile Dam tot Damloop race, but he could only manage sixth place with a time of 46:44. He then ran at the Memorial Peppe Greco and finished as runner-up, beaten to the line by a second by defending champion Edwin Soi.

    "text": "Rasputin is a 2003 Finnish-language opera in three acts by Einojuhani Rautavaara.  Roles   Synopsis   Act I  The Tsarevich, Alexei, has hemophilia, and the family doctors can find no solution. Tsarina Alexandra Alixs lady-in-waiting, Anna, recommends for them to call upon Father Grigori Rasputin. Rasputin soothes the Tsarevich by describing his homeland of Siberia, temporarily lessening his condition. Alix believes this to be a miracle, and from that point forward his influence grows. Rasputin comforts Alix, and there are romantic implications. Then, Khlysts appear and begin to perform a ritual dance. Rasputin eventually sinks into the middle of the crowd, proclaiming that sin redeems us. Meanwhile, Irina is being courted by Felix Yusupov and Dmitri Pavlovich. There are numerous rumors surrounding Felix and Dmitri, claiming that theyre a homosexual couple. Irina discusses this and more with Tsar Nicolas, and he monologues about his worries as Tsar and Father. The act ends with Anna having a terrible feeling about what is going to happen.  Act II  It is Easter night. Iliodor, a hieromonk, and Mitya, a yurodivy holy fool, preach to the people in a very fire-and-brimstone manner. The bishop Hermogen arrives and they lead a processional to the church. The doors open from the inside and Rasputin emerges, Hermogen remarking that he is Like Satan himself. Felix and Dmitri discuss their courting of Irina and flirt. They then conspire with Vladimir Purishkevich to kill Rasputin. They find it deeply offensive that an uneducated peasant has so much control over the royals and Russia in general. Felix also wants Russia to join the war against the Turks, which Rasputin vehemently opposes, knowing that it will further strain Russia. Meanwhile, Rasputin leads what is practically a sex cult, preaching that without sin there is no redemption. He has his way with a couple of the women and starts to drink. Then, multiple guests appear, among them Felix crossdressing, Dmitri, and Vladimir. Vladimir points his gun at Rasputins back multiple times, but each time he evades him. Rasputin, now completely drunk, rants about ruling Russia with the tsarina, dissolving the parliament, and other delusions. The three assassins eventually flee, and Rasputin blacks out. Iliodor and Mitya discuss Rasputins debauchery and they read a letter that seemingly condemns him as being in a relationship with the Tsarina. One of the women from the earlier scene, Gina Guseva, appears and begs the monk to allow her to kill Rasputin, and he gives her a knife. They confront Rasputin. He admits to his sins, and they call him a devil. Guseva stabs Rasputin, and they cry Die, Antichrist!  Act III  Rasputin is recovering in the hospital. He is surrounded by women. When night falls, he freaks out and believes he is being once again tempted by Satan. He sings once again about how Lovely sin must take place before repentance, in a kind of fever dream. Felix is with Irina and inquires about her feelings in a feverish blur of emotions. She says she is with him now and forever, which he is elated by. He then tells her that he plans to kill Rasputin, and she needs to be the bait. She does not want any part of this and leaves. Felix then collapses from ecstasy. In a dream, or perhaps a nightmare, he sees Rasputin, who with his eyes paralyzes him. We see the Tsar, his family, and the doctors again. They are still unable to do anything about Alexei so Alix calls upon Rasputin again. He soothes Alexei into a slumber, and then he manipulates Alix into accepting bribes from various politicians. Alix has a beautiful monologue about the darkening future. Felix, Dmitri, and Vladimir are preparing to kill Rasputin. They poison cookies and wine and prepare the gun. Rasputin arrives and asks about Irinas whereabouts. Felix says she is entertaining and offers him the cookies. Rasputin refuses. He offers him the wine. This time he accepts, but is seemingly unaffected by the poison. Felix eventually shoots Rasputin. The assassins remark that they have saved Russia, but Felix isnt so sure. He goes to check on the body and sure enough, Rasputin awakes, grabbing on to him and trying to escape. Vladimir shoots multiple times, eventually killing him. Alix has a premonition of the Romanovs fate, with Rasputin condemning them and telling them to flee.

    "text": "Sir James Robert George Graham, 2nd Baronet, 1 June 1792  25 October 1861 was a British statesman, who notably served as Home Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty. He was the eldest son of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, by Lady Catherine, eldest daughter of the 7th Earl of Galloway. In 1819, he married Fanny Callander, youngest daughter of Sir James Campbell of Craigforth and Ardkinglas Castle. Sir James was created Doctor of Laws at the University of Cambridge in 1835, was Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow, 1840. He was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1830 to 1834 when he resigned on account of the government pressing for a reform of the Irish Church. He became Secretary of the Home Department from September 1841 to July 1846 and again First Lord of the Admiralty from December 1852 until February 1855. He was a member of the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Deputy Lieutenant for county of Hertfordshire. He represented Kingston upon Hull from 1818 to 1820; for St Ives in 1820; for Carlisle from 1826 until 1829; for East Cumberland from 1830 until 1837; for Pembrokeshire District from 1838 until 1841; for Dorchester from 1841 until 1847; for Ripon from 1847 until July 1852; and was again returned for Carlisle from 1852 until his death in 1861. Graham Land in Antarctica is named after him.  Background and education  Graham was born at Naworth, Cumberland, the son of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, by his wife Lady Catherine, daughter of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway. He was taught at a private school at Dalston in Cumberland, kept by the Rev. Walter Fletcher, before attending Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He left Oxford after two years and while travelling for his pleasure abroad, he took up a position of private secretary to Lord Montgomerie, British diplomat in Sicily, during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. When Montgomerie became ill the responsibility for the mission fell on Graham. When Lord William Bentinck returned to the Embassy he agreed that Graham should retain the post. During this time he conducted the negotiations which led to the separation of Joachim Murat from Napoleon. When the war ended he returned to England. Back in London he became friends with Wilfrid Lawson, who went on to join Graham in politics. Lawson also became Grahams brother-in-law and father to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton.  Early political career   Whig beginnings  Back in London, Graham immersed himself in political affairs. Although his father was a staunch Tory he made his headquarters in Brookss Club where he made many Whig contacts. On 10 June 1818 he announced that he would contest the mercantile borough of Hull. Known at the time as the Yorkshire Dandy on account of his fine appearance and flowery speech, he stood on the Whig doctrine of Parliamentary reform, the abolition of unnecessary positions and pensions, peace, retrenchment, the abolition of the slave trade, and religious and civil liberties. After three days of open voting and official scrutiny, Graham entered parliament as the junior member by a mere four votes. However, he had gained the seat at great personal expense and notwithstanding other donations accrued a debt of 6,000. In January 1820, George IV succeeded thus forcing a dissolution of parliament. As a result of his past support for radical measures he failed to gain the necessary support to retain the Yorkshire seat and in consequence he stood and won the Cornish seat of St Ives, heading the poll with 205 votes. At Westminster, Graham maintained his campaign for economy, generally opposing the Governments proposed increase in the Royal Familys Civil List. However his parliamentary career, although undistinguished, now became brief: when charged with bribing the electorate he resigned rather than contest an expensive suit.  Agricultural improver  Graham returned to Cumberland and began a programme of improving the family estate at Netherby, with the intention that such improvements would benefit both the landowner and the tenant. He began with a one-off gesture, wiping out the arrears of his tenants debts. He reduced the number of small uneconomic farms on the estate; he rebuilt the cottages and farm-buildings, introduced tile drains whereby much marshy land was reclaimed, and improved the breed of stock on the estate, spending in excess of 100,000 over a twenty-year period. He eventually studied the Corn Laws and their effects upon the community, publishing his conclusions in a pamphlet of 114 pages entitled Corn and Currency, which brought him into prominence as a man of advanced Liberal opinions. He argued that liberal economics rather than protection would best serve the interests of the landowners. High duties on foreign corn had failed to help British agriculture and should be cut to a level where they simply balanced the landowners taxes and rates. Whereas high prices increased rents to the benefit",

    "text": "Richard Michael Corcoran born March 16, 1965 is an American attorney, education administrator, and former politician. He served as member of the Florida House of Representatives for two districts, he represented the 45th district from 2010 to 2012 and the 37th district from 2012 to 2018. He served as the one hundredth speaker of the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2018. He served as the 27th education commissioner of Florida from 2019 to 2022. He has served as president of New College of Florida since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party.  Early life and education  He was born and raised in Canada. After age 11 Corcoran resided in Pasco County, Florida, to which his family moved during 1976. His parents were both veterans of World War II. His father had served in the U.S. Army and his mother, a daughter of a British tea-planter, had served in the Womens Auxiliary Air Force of the Royal Air Force during the London Blitz. After attending and dropping out of the University of Florida, Corcoran earned a bachelors degree in 1989 from St. Leo College. During 19871993, he served six years in the United States Naval Reserve. In 1996, he earned a Juris Doctor from Regent University School of Law. Three years later he took and passed the Florida Bar.  Political, legal, and education career   19892005  Corcorans first job after graduation from St. Leo was with Rep. John Renke of New Port Richey, state Republican house leader, until the election defeat of Renke by Phil Mishkin in a race orchestrated by T. K. Wetherell, the house speaker and future FSU president. Corcoran then worked as a legislative aide for his friend Paul Hawkes, representative in the Florida House from 1990 to 1994. Corcoran ran the 1994 initial election campaign for Mike Fasano to the Florida House who later would become majority leader and senate president. Between 1996 and 1998, Corcoran was deputy to Daniel Webster, the first Republican elected as house speaker in a century. In 1998, when for the first time he sought to be elected to a seat in the Florida house of representatives, Corcoran ran his own campaign. He lost the race in the Republican primary to Nancy Argenziano, who was elected to the 19962002 term and went on to be elected a state senator in 2002. Corcoran was admitted to the Florida Bar on September 21, 1999, three years after completing law school. He worked as outside counsel for former House Speaker Tom Feeney in 2002.  20062010  In 2006, Corcoran worked for candidate Marco Rubio, where he was involved in writing and promoting Rubios political tract 100 Innovative Ideas for Floridas Future. After that years election, he became chief of staff to the new House Speaker. Corcoran resigned to prepare for a 2007 state senate election bid for the seat being vacated by Argenzianos appointment to the Public Service Commission, but Corcoran dropped out of the race prior to the general election, which would be won by Charles S. Dean Sr. When he was chief aide to Marco Rubio, Corcorans spending of Republican Party of Florida funds drew scrutiny. His spending on flights, hotels, and restaurants from party funds in 2015 and 2016 also drew critics. Corcoran rejected suggestions that the spending such as an 8,000 meal at The French Laundry in Napa Valley was excessive. Corcoran also was hired by future governor Rick Scott to do legal work for Solantic.  20102018  When incumbent state representative Tom Anderson was unable to seek re-election due to term limits in 2010, Corcoran ran a successful campaign to succeed him in the 45th District, which included parts of southern Pasco County and northern Pinellas County. During his term, Corcoran secured promises from fellow Republican representatives to elect him to the office of speaker for the 20162018 legislative session if he won that election. His leading rival for the position was fellow freshman representative Matt Gaetz. At the time, Corcoran released an 80-page reform manifesto entitled Blue Print Florida. In 2011, he was hired as counsel at the Tampa offices of the law firm Broad and Cassel. When the state legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Corcoran was drawn into the 37th District, which included some of the areas in Pasco County that he represented in the 45th District. Corcoran faced a challenge from Strother Hammond in the Republican primary. He was endorsed for re-election by The Tampa Tribune. Corcoran defeated Hammond, gathering nearly 84 of the vote. Corcoran was subsequently re-elected without opposition in both 2014 and 2016. During his time as representative, he led an effort to oppose Medicaid expansion. He criticized Enterprise Florida and Visit Florida. As he had secured promised commitments from fellow representatives while campaigning in 2010, following his 2016 election, Corcoran became speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 20162018 legislative session.

    "text": "Frank Paul Beyer German: fʁaŋk ˈbaɪ.ɐ ; 26 May 1932  1 October 2006 was a German film director. In East Germany he was one of the most important film directors, working for the state film monopoly DEFA and directed films that dealt mostly with the Nazi era and contemporary East Germany. His film Trace of Stones was banned for 20 years in 1966 by the ruling SED. His 1975 film Jacob the Liar was the only East German film ever nominated for an Academy Award. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 until his death he mostly directed television films.  Biography   Early life and career  Frank Beyer was born as Frank Paul Beyer in Nobitz in Thuringia, Germany, to Paul Beyer, a clerk, and Charlotte Beyer, a sales clerk. He had a brother, Hermann Beyer born 30 May 1943 who should have become a successful actor. After the Machtergreifung of the Nazi Party in 1933 his father, a social democrat lost his job and was unemployed for several years. In 1942 he was drafted for military service and was killed one year later at the Eastern Front. In 1938 Frank Beyer started attending primary school in Nobitz, and later the Realgymnasium Ernestinum in Altenburg. His education was interrupted for a few months in the aftermath of World War II. In fall 1946 he continued his education in Altenburg and played in an amateur dramatic society. He also became a member of the Free German Youth and later of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. After finishing school with his Abitur in 1950 he wanted to study history at the University of Leipzig, but at the request of the socialist unity party he stayed in Altenburg and worked as district party secretary for the local cultural association. At the same time he trained to become a film projectionist, and being interested in theater wrote play reviews for the local newspaper. Later he worked at the theater of the towns of Crimmitschau and Glauchau as an assistant director and dramaturge. In 1952 Frank Beyer began to study drama at Humboldt University in Berlin, but transferred to the Film School of the Academy of Performing Arts FAMU in Prague shortly afterwards. In Prague he studies film directing together with his future colleagues Konrad Petzold and Ralf Kirsten. In 1954 he works as an intern at the DEFA film studio during the production of the film Ernst Thälmann  Sohn seiner Klasse directed by Kurt Maetzig. He completed another internship as an assistant director for a film adapted from the opera Zar und Zimmermann and directed by Hans Müller. In his fourth year of studies, in 1957, he worked as an assistant director for Kurt Maetzigs two part film Schlösser und Katen with a special permission of his university. In 1957 he graduated from FAMU with the anti-war film Zwei Mütter. Based on a screenplay by Leonie Ossowski, his diploma film tells the story of a French and a German mother that fight for a child that has been mistakenly taken by the German after a bomb raid. The film had a theatrical release and became a success.  Beyer at the DEFA studios 19571967  After graduation Frank Beyer worked as a freelancer for the DEFA studios. He had declined an offer for a permanent position as an assistant director, as he would have been assigned to film projects and would not have had the freedom to choose. He started his directorial career with two short films in the satirical film series Das Stacheltier. His second feature film Eine alte Liebe based on a story by Werner Reinowski and released in 1958 did not follow the success of his directorial debut Zwei Mütter. His third feature film Five Cartridges released in 1960 was a major critical and popular success and made him known in East Germany and abroad. The film was based on a screenplay by Walter Gorrish and tells the story of the members of an international brigade during the Spanish Civil War. He continued to direct films that focused on anti-fascist themes. The 1962 film Star-Crossed Lovers was again based on a screenplay by Walter Gorrish and told the story of the antifascist activist Michael who has to serve in a penal military unit on the Eastern Front during World War II, and escapes with the help of his childhood friend Jürgen. Deserting to the Red army he hopes to meet his childhood friend and love Magdalena in Moscow, as she had fled from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. The experimental film made extensive use of flashbacks and extreme angles of view to express the emotions of the characters. His next project was the 1963 film Naked Among Wolves based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Bruno Apitz. The film told the story of prisoners in the Buchenwald concentration camp who risk their lives to hide a Jewish boy, Stefan Jerzy Zweig. The film is now regarded as a classic anti-fascist DEFA studio films. His next film, the 1963 comedy Carbide and Sorrel was a major popular success. In 1966 Frank Beyer directed the film Trace of Stones based on a novel by Erik Neutsch. The film is set in co",

Its initial registered capital was Renminbi Yuan RMB 5,500,000, contributed by Sun Group High Technology Development Co., Ltd, a limited liability company registered in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, the Peoples Republic of China, and Ms. Li Zhi, a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China. Prior to April 2006, DLXYs principal activity was acting as a research center to develop technologically feasible nanometers to be used in lithium batteries and generated no revenue. It was considered as a development stage company. In April 2006, DLXY began production and sales of cobaltosic oxide which is used as the anode of high capacity lithium ion rechargeable batteries. Sales are made primarily to battery manufacturers. Currently, all of DLXYs operations and customers are located in the Peoples Republic of China.

The first batch of lithium iron phosphate energy productions came out of China Sun Groups production lines in April 2009. In June, China Sun Group entered into contracts with four battery production companies to begin testing samples of lithium iron phosphate. Once this testing is complete, the company plans to begin mass marketing the product domestically. The testing involves running the batteries on the natural attenuation rate curve, which measures the rate of decay over time on a curve. Early reports have indicated that customer testing indicated good consistency with little decay, which is very promising given the market potential for the products in several major Chinese provinces.

    "text": "Its My Party is a song by English singer-songwriter Jessie J, released as the second single from her second studio album, Alive 2013. The song was written by Jessie J, Claude Kelly, John Lardieri and Colin Norman, and produced by Lardieri and Kelly. The track premiered on UK radio on 5 August 2013 and was officially released in the UK via iTunes on 15 September 2013. Jessie J recorded the official video at the end of June and it was directed by Emil Nava.  Background  Its My Party is a mid-tempo song in the key of A major, written by Jessie J, Claude Kelly John Lardieri  Colin Norman. The song received its first radio play on Capital FM on 5 August 2013 and was released on 15 September 2013. The song shares its title with Lesley Gores 1963 hit song. Speaking on the syndicated radio show, In:Demand with Alex James, Jessie revealed that it was her detractors who inspired the song. A lot of the time the haters  I hate calling them haters but thats the easiest way to sum it up  they need love more so than anyone else, she said. I dont think hate does anything for the world. It doesnt do any good. I wanted to make sure I had a song that represented what Im about.  Reception  Its My Party garnered mixed reviews from critics. UnrealityTV gave Its My Party three stars out of five wrote, I feel Jessies vocals are distorted at times on Its My Party, the chord is too high  it was the same problem with Wild at points in the song. Kevipod of DirectLyrics said, On the first listen, Its My Party sounds like a big utter mess. It strikes as generic, not current, the vocals are a mess, and the talking she does is...I cannot find the right words to describe this. Whats happening to Jessie J this era?. For real!. Karen Lanza of PopCrush commented: Hearing a song called Its My Party, you expect to indulge the recording artist as much as you do your bestie when she throws herself a birthday bash. It is, after all, her party, and shell most likely do whatever the heck she wants. But it doesnt mean you have to like it. With her newly released single, Jessie J fails to take full advantage of the listeners goodwill following the urban-edged Wild, the well-received first track off of her as-yet-untitled second album. With its frantic beats and eff-off lyrics, Its My Party aims to be a full-stop dance-floor anthem for the waning days of summer. The lyrics are indeed fun  who doesnt love telling off haters?  but the tune itself is lacking the hooks to keep you from forgetting it the second its 3 minutes, 38 seconds are over.  Music video  The music video was directed by Emil Nava. Jessie told about the songs music video. Its basically me having parties, she said. Three very different parties that I kind of bring together as one big party. Theres some cameos in there, some of my best mates in there Daley and model Jourdan Dunn. Its a fun video where its just me being silly. A lot of humor. John Walker of MTV Buzzworthy commented: The clip opens on our boisterous heroine alone in a hallway, where she peeps through the keyholes into two very different party scenes: the first prim and proper, the second completely OOC. Obviously Jessie picks the fun party, where she bounces around with her newfound freak friends including model Anita De Bauch and breaks into the chorus: Its my party Ill do what I want.

    "text": "The term monumental sculpture is often used in art history and criticism, but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians, although in contemporary art a rather larger overall scale is implied. Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable figurines, small metal or ivory reliefs, diptychs and the like. The term is also used to describe sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a monument of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, tomb monuments or memorials, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just funerary sculpture for church monuments. The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are. The entry for Monumental in A Dictionary of Art and Artists by Peter and Linda Murray describes it as: The most overworked word in current art history and criticism. It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for large. However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or used in a memorial may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate. For example, when Meyer Schapiro, after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at Moissac, says: in the tympanum of the south portal right the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental. It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance. It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ..., size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiros further comments suggest that a lack of excess of virtuousity does not form part of what he intends to convey. Nonetheless, parts of the Murrays concept grand, noble, elevated in idea are included in his meaning, although simple in conception and execution hardly seems to apply.  Meaning in different contexts  It is only in wealthy societies that the possibility of creating sculptures that are large but merely decorative really exists at least in long-lived materials such as stone, so for most of art history the different senses of the term cause no difficulties. The term may be used differently for different periods, with breaks occurring around the Renaissance and the early 20th century: for ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally the criterion, though smaller architectural sculptures are usually covered by the term, but in the Early Modern period a specific funerary function may be meant, before the typical meaning once again comes to refer to size alone for contemporary sculpture. The relevant chapters in Parts 2-4 of The Oxford History of Western Art are titled as follows: Monumental Sculpture to c.1300, Monumental Sculpture 13001600, Free-standing Sculpture c.1600c.1700, Forms in Space c.17001770, Sculptures and Publics 17701914.  In art history   Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture  In archeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture using the size criterion in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains; the totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology. The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. In Ancient Egypt, the Great Sphinx of Giza probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC, and may be older than the Pyramids of Egypt. The discovery in 1986 of an ancient Chinese Bronze Age 8.5-foot-tall 2.6 m bronze statue at Sanxingdui disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known. Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valle",

    "text": "Activity-based costing ABC is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs overhead into direct costs compared to conventional costing. The UKs Chartered Institute of Management Accountants CIMA, defines ABC as an approach to the costing and monitoring of activities which involves tracing resource consumption and costing final outputs. Resources are assigned to activities, and activities to cost objects based on consumption estimates. The latter utilize cost drivers to attach activity costs to outputs. The Institute of Cost Accountants of India says, ABC systems calculate the costs of individual activities and assign costs to cost objects such as products and services on the basis of the activities undertaken to produce each product or services. It accurately identifies sources of profit and loss. The Institute of Cost  Management Accountants of Bangladesh ICMAB defines activity-based costing as an accounting method which identifies the activities which a firm performs and then assigns indirect costs to cost objects.  Objectives  With ABC, a company can soundly estimate the cost elements of entire products, activities and services, that may help inform a companys decision to either: Identify and eliminate those products and services that are unprofitable and lower the prices of those that are overpriced product and service portfolio aim, or Identify and eliminate production or service processes which are ineffective, and allocate processing concepts that lead to the very same product at a better yield process re-engineering aim In a business organization, the ABC methodology assigns an organizations resource costs through activities to the products and services provided to its customers. ABC is generally used as a tool for understanding product and customer cost and profitability based on the production or performing processes. As such, ABC has predominantly been used to support strategic decisions such as pricing, outsourcing, identification and measurement of process improvement initiatives.  Prevalence  Following strong initial uptake, ABC lost ground in the 1990s compared to alternative metrics, such as Kaplans balanced scorecard and economic value added. An independent 2008 report concluded that manually driven ABC was an inefficient use of resources: it was expensive and difficult to implement for small gains, and a poor value, and that alternative methods should be used. Other reports show the broad band covered with the ABC methodology. However, application of an activity based recording may be applied as an addition to activity based accounting, not as a replacement of any costing model, but to transform concurrent process accounting into a more authentic approach.  Historical development  Traditionally, cost accountants had arbitrarily added a broad percentage of analysis into the indirect cost. In addition, activities include actions that are performed both by people and machine. However, as the percentages of indirect or overhead costs rose, this technique became increasingly inaccurate, because indirect costs were not caused equally by all products. For example, one product might take more time in one expensive machine than another productbut since the amount of direct labor and materials might be the same, additional cost for use of the machine is not being recognized when the same broad on-cost percentage is added to all products. Consequently, when multiple products share common costs, there is a danger of one product subsidizing another. ABC is based on George Staubus Activity Costing and Input-Output Accounting. The concepts of ABC were developed in the manufacturing sector of the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. During this time, the Consortium for Advanced Management-International, now known simply as CAM-I, provided a formative role for studying and formalizing the principles that have become more formally known as Activity-Based Costing. Robin Cooper and Robert S. Kaplan, proponents of the Balanced Scorecard, brought notice to these concepts in a number of articles published in Harvard Business Review beginning in 1988. Cooper and Kaplan described ABC as an approach to solve the problems of traditional cost management systems. These traditional costing systems are often unable to determine accurately the actual costs of production and of the costs of related services. Consequently, managers were making decisions based on inaccurate data especially where there are multiple products. Instead of using broad arbitrary percentages to allocate costs, ABC seeks to identify cause and effect relationships to objectively assign costs. Once costs of the activities have been identified, the cost of each activity is attributed to each product to the extent that the prod",

    "text": "Football is the most popular sport in Qatar. Almost half of the people in Qatar are interested in football Football in Qatar is organized by the Qatar Football Association QFA. Qatar has hosted the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup, 2023 AFC Asian Cup, and the 2024 AFC U-23 Asian Cup.  History   Origins 1940s1950s  Football was introduced to the country in the 1940s when oil workers from India and northern Arab states organized a match among themselves. The first documented teams in Qatar was a team formed for the Northern Arab Region, and also a team formed the near the Al-Khatia area of Dukhan. The Hazel Dayne Cup was the inaugural competition in the area, teams including Al-Najah, Al-Shorta, Al-Tahrir, and Al-Maaref took part in the tournament. A subsequent competition was the Izz al-Din Championship organised by 1951 which was founded by the Qatar Oil Company. Eventually, the name was changed to the Pukett Cup in the late 1950s. The first football club formed in the Qatari region was Al-Shorta in 1938. While Al-Najah now known as Al-Ahli followed, becoming the first professional club in the region, being established in 1950. It was established by the founders of another club, which was called Sawt al-Arab, clubs were eventually formed afterwards which would go on to participate in the Qatari League. In 1957, the Qatari youth squad won the Al-Qusaibi Cup for the first time, defeating the Saudi Al-Ettifaq club, the league winners at the time, by 32. This was the first trophy won outside of Qatars boundaries. The Qatari Al-Nasr team also played a friendly match against the Al-Ittihad, winning 20 and received a massive silver-plated trophy which was built in Pakistan specifically for the occasion. Football went from Dukhan to the neighbourhoods of Qatars capital, Doha, near the conclusion of this century and the beginning of the 1960s, when the official foundation of clubs began.  Early years 1960s1970s  The QFA also known as the Qatar Football Association was formed in 1960. And in 1963 The federation joined FIFA. Eventually also joining the AFC in 1967. With growing interest among youth and communities in the region, eventually a league was formed. The league came to be known as the Qatari League was formed in 1960 and the first league season was launched in 196364. League matches were held at the Doha Stadium, it was not until the 197273 season where the league officially started. League titles in the 1960s were dominated by clubs like Al-Maaref, Al-Oruba, Al Sadd, etc. The Doha Stadium held and accommodated the first grass football pitch in the gulf region. Alongside several youth events which Qatari footballers like Badr Bilal, Ibrahim Khalfan, Khalid Salman, Mansour Muftah, participated in. It also saw the formation of the first Qatari school team, which participated in the 1963 Arab School Games held in Kuwait. The 1960s also saw numerous teams come to play in Qatar, such as Ismaily SC, Taj FC, Al-Riffa, Al-Muharraq, etc. In 1960, the first committee responsible for organizing sports activities in Qatar was established under the name Qatar Sports Federation for Sports Games. It was chaired by Sheikh Suhaim bin Hamad Al Thani, with Hitmi Al Hitmi, Majid bin Saad Al Saad, and Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Mutawa serving as members. The committees work was short-lived and came to an end following the resignation of its members. In 1962, the committee was reconstituted under the chairmanship of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani. Hitmi Hamad Al Hitmi was appointed Vice Chairman, Mohammed bin Ali Al Ansari served as Secretary, and Majid bin Saad Al Saad and Mohammed Salah Morsi, the latter representing the Ministry of Education served as members. The committee also appointed Professor Fawzi Al-Dali, a Syrian educator, as a consultant to assist in drafting regulations for local competitions. A permanent headquarters was established for the committee in two ministry-owned villas located near Doha Stadium. The headquarters was furnished and supplied with official documentation, while regulations and administrative programs were developed to organize football activities. During this period, the committee laid down the fundamental rules of football in Qatar and defined its organizational objectives. It regularly consulted with sports and cultural clubs, offered technical guidance, organized local tournaments, and drafted regulations governing clubs and competitions. The committee also organized the first national football league for clubs, utilizing the facilities of Al-Maaref Club. In 1963, the committee was formed for the third time following an increase in the number of sports clubs in Doha and other regions, which made it necessary to reorganize sports activities in the country.  Emergence 1970s1990s  The Qatar national football team was formed and debuted in the 1970 Gulf Cup. In the tournament, the team faced disappointin",

    "text": "Charlton Viaduct is a disused railway bridge in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in south-west England. It is a Grade II listed building.  History  The bridge was built in 1874 by the civil engineer William Henry Barlow for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway SDJR to carry its line from Evercreech to the south, through the Mendip Hills, towards Bath. It crosses the River Sheppey at the north-eastern edge of Shepton Mallet, where the railway curves around a patch of high ground. The bridge was built in locally mined grey limestone and originally carried a single track. The line was double-tracked in 1894 and the viaduct was widened with blue brick and faced with stone. The line closed in 1966 as a result of the Beeching cuts. The viaduct is a Grade II listed building, first listed on 20 May 1952, a status which provides legal protection from demolition. In 2023, a scheme was approved to turn part of the SDJR route into a walking and cycling trail, including the nearby Ham Wood Viaduct and Bath Road Viaduct and Windsor Hill Tunnel. The promoters of the scheme hoped to extend it to Shepton Mallet via Charlton Viaduct in a later phase.  Design  The viaduct is 317 yards 290 metres. It consists of 27 segmental arches each of which has a span of 28 feet 8.5 metres and with a maximum height of 45 feet 14 metres. It is on a curve of 30 chains 600 m radius falling at 1 in 55 from each end to the midpoint. To cope with the curve the arches are strengthened by buttresses at every third pier. The arch barrels and piers are in brick but faced in masonry. The spandrels, and parapets are entirely in masonry. The viaduct is one of seven on the route, all built to a similar specification. The next structure on the line, the Bath Road Viaduct, is particularly similar and is also a listed building. The Bath Road Viaduct is taller but only has six arches to Charltons twenty-seven. The viaduct can be seen from the grounds of Kilver Court where it forms a feature.  See also  Grade II listed buildings in Mendip  References   External links  Aerial video of the viaduct",

    "text": "Middlethorpe Hall is a 17th-century English country house standing in 20 acres 8 ha of grounds in Middlethorpe, York, North Yorkshire. It is a perfectly symmetrical red brick and stone house built in 1699 and since 2008 has been owned by the National Trust. It is currently used as a hotel.  Description  The house is quite close to the road which is unusual for its architectural standard. Like many grand houses of the time, it is influenced indirectly by Sir Christopher Wren, especially Hampton Court Palace with a similar horizontal skyline and pattern of red brick, white sash windows and stone quoins and window surrounds. The north entrance front of seven bays and three storeys plus a basement is surrounded by a stone eagle, the Barlow family crest. The pedimented porch over the front door is an early 19th-century addition and the curved railings and gates enclosing the forecourt were added in 1983. The south front, the main façade of the house, is surmounted by a raised stone parapet of three panels containing carved festoons and crowned by another stone eagle. It is more impressive than the north front because of the flanking wings added in the mid-18th century by Francis Barlow. The bays of these single storey additions are divided by pilasters with well carved composite capitals and are surmounted by a balustraded parapet. The front door leads straight into the stone-flagged entrance hall, as in a medieval house. Beyond to the south is a carved oak staircase with fluted and foliated balusters, a York motif, standing on steps with scrolled panelled ends. The staircase is supported by a Corinthian column and may have been moved at some point. The floor is paved with black and white marble squares. There is a panelled drawing room leading to an enormous ballroom occupying the western of the two wings added c. 1750. The dining room dates from the original period and has round head panels flanked by Ionic pilasters.  History  The house was built in c. 16991701 for Thomas Barlow, a prosperous master cutler who bought the Middlethorpe estate in 1698 as a bid to establish himself as a country gentleman. In 1712, Thomas Barlow and his son Francis went on the Grand Tour and let the house in August 1713 for a year to Lady Mary Wortley and her Daughter Lady Mary Anne Wortley who married John Stuart Montague 3rd Earl of Bute in 1736 in their absence. Francis later served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 173436. The house descended in the Barlow family to Frances Barlow, who married Manchester based physician Matthew Alexander Eason Wilkinson 18131878 and moved away. Frances Wilkinson died after a brief marriage but her husband and his second wife Louisa Letitia, née Walker c. 18261889 lived at the hall with their six children. The gardens at Middlethorpe Hall are credited with inspiring the career of their daughter Fanny Wilkinson, the first professional female landscape designer in Britain. For most of the 19th and early 20th century, the house remained in the Wilkinson family but was let to various tenants. From 1851 it was occupied by a girls boarding school for 30 years. In 1972, it became Brummels night club. In 1980, it was acquired by Historic House Hotels, who improved and restored the grounds and outbuildings with hundreds of trees planted and the addition of a ha-ha and lake. A dilapidated late 17th-century dovecote was restored, the kitchen garden was replanted, and stable buildings were converted and extended for additional hotel accommodation. The hall and grounds were then gifted to the National Trust by the directors of Historic House Hotels HHH. The hall continues its present use as a hotel under the existing HHH management. Three National Trust directors joined the HHH board and all profits will go to Trust funds to provide for the long-term care of the house. The gift had been under discussion for almost 30 years and in 1997 the National Trust accepted restrictive covenants over the property. Trustees of the National Trust completed the transfer deal in September 2008 by declaring the hall together with two other properties inalienable. It is envisaged that arrangements will be put in place for the gardens and grounds of the hall to be open to visitors, along with tours of the ground floor rooms. Members of the Trust are welcome as hotel guests, as are members of the public.  See also  Grade II listed buildings in the City of York  References   External links  Historic England.

Critical reception  Martin Woodside of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying: Most of the songs here are built around fantasy, and Cages fantasies tend to be dark and angry, revolving around sex, violence, and substance abuse. He added: The team of producers lays down a diverse blend of styles that matches Cages bizarre, brooding vocals from beginning to end. Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

    "text": "Master Oats 14 May 1986  21 May 2012 was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. A specialist steeplechaser, he ran twenty-one time and won ten races. He campaigned mainly at distances in excess of three miles and was particularly effective on soft or heavy ground. Over a period of sixteen months between November 1993 and March 1995 Master Oats won nine of his eleven races and improved from racing in minor handicaps to becoming the highest-rated staying chaser in Britain. His winning run culminated in a win in the 1995 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He also ran in three editions of the Grand National, twice carrying top weight. His later career was disrupted by injury and he failed to win again after his Gold Cup success. Master Oats was retired from racing in 1998 and died in 2012.  Background  Master Oats was a chestnut horse with a narrow white stripe bred by Robin and Scarlett Knipe at the Cobhall Court Stud near Allensmore in Herefordshire. He was sired by Oats, a successful National Hunt stallion whose other progeny included the Champion Hurdle winner Flakey Dove. Master Oats was sent to the Doncaster Sales as a foal in 1986 where he was sold for 6,000. He first raced in the colours of Mrs Hugh Maitland-Jones and was sent into training with Henrietta Knight. After one run in an amateur Point-to-point race he was moved to the Lambourn stable of Kim Bailey, who trained him throughout the rest of his racing career. Master Oats usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Throughout his racing career, Master Oats suffered from a tendency to break blood vessels under stress, and therefore had to be trained with unusual care.  Racing career   19911992: early career  Unlike many steeplechasers, Master Oats never competed in National Hunt flat races or over hurdles. He ran once without success in an amateur point-to-point race before beginning his career under National Hunt rules in Novice chases. After being pulled-up at Newbury Racecourse in November, he was campaigned at minor tracks, winning at Southwell Racecourse and being place at Wolverhampton and Stratford. After his first season, Master Oats racing career was disrupted by injury and he was off the racecourse for eighteen months. During this time he entered into the ownership of Paul Matthews.  19931994 season  Master Oats returned in November 1993 with an official rating of 107, placing him approximately sixty pounds below championship class. He began in a handicap race at Uttoxeter Racecourse and won by a length and a half despite breaking a blood vessel. This was the first occasion on which he was ridden by Norman Williamson who became his regular jockey. In late December he won a similar event at Huntingdon Racecourse by twelve lengths under top weight of 165 pounds and then finished second at Wincanton in January. Later that month he won a handicap at Lingfield Park by two lengths despite being eased down by Williamson at the finish. Master Oats rating had moved up to 137 by this time although his most valuable race win had earned bis owners less than 4,000. Master Oats next race saw him take on much stronger opposition in the Greenalls Gold Cup over three and a half miles at Kempton Park moved from Haydock Park because of bad weather. The race was considered a trial for the Grand National and attracted leading chasers including Garrison Savannah Cheltenham Gold Cup, Young Hustler RSA Chase and Moorcroft Boy Scottish Grand National. Williamson sent Master Oats into the lead four fences from the finish and the gelding turned the race into a procession according to The Independent staying on strongly on the soft ground to win by fifteen lengths. At Aintree Racecourse on 9 April, Master Oats started third favourite of the thirty-six runners in the 1994 Grand National at odds of 91, and was expected to be ideally suited by the heavy ground. Master Oats appeared to be going well and was moving up towards the leaders when he fell at the thirteenth fence of the race won by Miinnehoma. The horse was not injured and returned two weeks later to end his season with a very easy win under top weight in a race at Perth.  19941995 season  Master Oats first run of the 199495 season saw him pitted against the 1992 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Cool Ground and the 1992 Grand National winner Party Politics in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow. He took the lead at the eleventh fence and stayed on to repel the challenge of Party Politics by four lengths. On New Years Eve Master Oats started 52 joint favourite for the Welsh National over three and three quarter miles on heavy ground. The race was moved to Newbury from its traditional venue at Chepstow, where racing had been abandoned owing to the weather and ground conditions. Williamson sent him into the lead four fences from the finish and the horse steadily increased his lead to win by twenty lengths from Earth Summit. After the race he was heavily backed for the Cheltenham Go",

    "text": "Carl Heins 8 June 1859 - 10 September 1923 was a German pianist, and a composer of light salon music in classical music style. He wrote both solo piano works and parlor songs. Heins pieces show a special pianoesque ability to fashion pretty melodies picturesquely in the salon style of the time. His competency on the keyboard led him to perform and compose. He composed the song Zwei Dunkle Augen, which was recorded by the tenor Fritz Wunderlich. Stylistically his music is similar to that of his older compatriot Carl Bohm. Robert Leonhardt, an operatic baritone who sang with the New York Metropolitan Opera company between 1913 and 1922, made numerous recordings for many major record labels, both in Europe and in the United States. An early recording he made on Gramophone 42325 with matrix number 1113B54 was Zwei dunkle Augen by Carl Heins. Leonhardt recorded it onto a 78rpm in October 1901 when he was 24.

    "text": "Peter Harry Steve Griffiths 24 May 1928  20 November 2013 was a British Conservative politician best known for gaining the Smethwick seat by defeating the Shadow Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker in the 1964 general election, against the national trend, by using anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric.  Early life  Griffiths was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, and attended West Bromwich Grammar School. He was educated at Leeds Teacher Training College and, after his National Service, studied for an external London University economics degree and a masters degree in education at Birmingham University, while teaching in West Bromwich. From 1962, he was the head of Hall Green Road primary school, West Bromwich. Griffiths was elected to Smethwick County Borough Council in 1955. At the 1959 election, he stood against Smethwicks sitting Member of Parliament MP Patrick Gordon Walker for the first time, and succeeded in reducing Gordon Walkers majority from 6,495 to 3,544. Griffiths became leader of the councils Conservative group in 1960, serving as a local councillor until 1963 when he resigned to stand again for the Smethwick parliamentary seat in the forthcoming general election.  Elected MP for Smethwick  Labours victory in the 1964 election had been predicted, and Patrick Gordon Walker, who had been Shadow Foreign Secretary for 18 months, was expected to hold on to his seat. Instead, Griffiths gained the seat for the Conservatives on a 7 swing, in a county borough that had the highest percentage of recent immigrants to England. Racial discrimination was common in the constituency and nationally; the local Labour club operated a colour bar. In what Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson later described as an utterly squalid campaign, Conservative party members were accused of having used the slogan If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour. Colin Jordan, a British Neo-Nazi and leader of the British Movement, said that members of his group had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the poster and sticker campaign; Jordans group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: Dont vote  a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!. Although Griffiths himself did not coin the phrase or approve its use, he declined to disown it. The Times quoted Griffiths as saying: I would not condemn any man who said that. I regard it as a manifestation of popular feeling, adding that the quote represented exasperation, not fascism. He denied that there was any resentment in Smethwick on the grounds of race or colour. Griffiths defeat of Gordon Walker resulted in Harold Wilson saying in the House of Commons that Griffiths should serve his term here as a parliamentary leper. Conservatives urged the Speaker, Harry Hylton-Foster, to force Wilson to withdraw the comment. While the Speaker objected to such language, he refused to censure the Prime Minister, and order in the Commons chamber was not restored for ten minutes. In his maiden speech in the Commons, Griffiths pointed out the problems faced by local industry and drew attention to the fact that 4,000 families were awaiting local authority accommodation. Griffiths remained an alderman in Smethwick until 1966. He both supported and arranged for Smethwick council to purchase a row of houses with the intention of letting them exclusively to white families. The governments Housing minister, Richard Crossman, was able to block this proposal by refusing the council permission to borrow the money required. Griffiths was defeated by the actor and Labour candidate Andrew Faulds in the 1966 general election. Griffiths wrote his own account of his election in 1964. In A Question of Colour 1966, he said that he had no colour prejudice. In the book he considered South Africa to be a model of Parliamentary democracy and that Apartheid, if it could be separated from racialism, could well be an alternative to integration. Griffiths also blamed immigration from the Caribbean for the spread of disease.  Later life and career  In 1967, he became a lecturer in economics at Portsmouth College of Technology. After a year as an exchange professor in California, he returned to what became Portsmouth Polytechnic, until he returned to Parliament. Griffiths unsuccessfully stood for the Portsmouth North constituency at the February 1974 general election, but was elected for the seat at the 1979 general election. He held the constituency until the Labour landslide at the 1997 election, when he was defeated.  Personal life  Griffiths was married to Jeannette née Rubery; the couple had a son and daughter. Griffiths died on 20 November 2013, aged 85.  References   Bibliography  Griffiths, P. 1966. A Question of Colour? The Smethwick Election of 1964. London: Leslie Frewin. Pearce, R. 2004.

    "text": "The Suwannee River also spelled Suwanee River or Swanee River is a river that runs through south Georgia southward into Florida in the Southern United States. It is a wild blackwater river, about 246 miles 396 km long. The Suwannee River is the site of the prehistoric Suwanee Straits that separated the Florida peninsula from the Florida panhandle and the rest of the continent. Spelled as Swanee, it is the namesake of two famous songs: Stephen Fosters Swanee River 1851 and George Gershwin and Irving Caesars Swanee 1919.  Geography  The headwaters of the Suwannee River are in the Okefenokee Swamp in the town of Fargo, Georgia. The river runs southwestward into the Florida Panhandle, then drops in elevation through limestone layers into a rare Florida whitewater rapid. Past the rapid, the Suwanee turns west near the town of White Springs, Florida, then connects to the confluences of the Alapaha River and Withlacoochee River. The confluences of these three rivers form the southern borderline of Hamilton County, Florida. The Suwanee then bends southward near the town of Ellaville, followed by Luraville, then joins together with the Santa Fe River from the east, south of the town of Branford. The river ends and drains into the Gulf of Mexico on the outskirts of Suwannee.  Etymology  The Spanish recorded the native Timucua name of Guacara for the river that would later become known as the Suwannee. Different etymologies have been suggested for the modern name. San Juan: D.G. Brinton first suggested in his 1859 Notes on the Floridian Peninsula that Suwannee was a corruption of the Spanish San Juan. This theory is supported by Jerald Milanich, who states that Suwannee developed through San Juan-ee from the 17th century Spanish mission of San Juan de Guacara, located on the Suwannee River. Shawnee: The migrations of the Shawnee Shawnee: Shaawanwaki; Muscogee: Sawanoke throughout the South have also been connected to the name Suwannee. As early as 1820, the Indian agent John Johnson said the Suwaney river was doubtless named after the Shawanoese Shawnee, Suwaney being a corruption of Shawanoese. However, the primary southern Shawnee settlements were along the Savannah River, with only the village of Ephippeck on the Apalachicola River being securely identified in Florida, casting doubt on this etymology. Echo: In 1884, Albert S. Gatschet claimed that Suwannee derives from the Creek word sawani, meaning echo, rejecting the earlier Shawnee theory. Stephen Boyds 1885 Indian Local Names with their Interpretation and Henry Gannetts 1905 work The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States repeat this interpretation, calling sawani an Indian word for echo river. Gatschets etymology also survives in more recent publications, often mistaking the language of translation. For example, a University of South Florida website states that the Timucuan Indian word Suwani means Echo River ... River of Reeds, Deep Water, or Crooked Black Water. In 2004, William Bright repeats it again, now attributing the name Suwanee to a Cherokee village of Sawani, which is unlikely as the Cherokee never lived in Florida or south Georgia. This etymology is now considered doubtful: 2004s A Dictionary of Creek Muscogee does not include the river as a place-name derived from Muscogee, and also lacks entries for echo and for words such as svwane, sawane, or svwvne, which would correspond to the anglicization Suwannee. Kikongo language: According to Larry Eugene Rivers, the name Suwanee could be derived from the Bantu word nsubwanyi, translating to my house, my home among the Black Seminoles in Florida who spoke an Afro-Seminole Creole and established settlements along the Suwanee river.  History  The Suwannee River area has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. During the first millennium it was inhabited by the people of the Weedon Island culture, and around the year 900 a derivative local culture known as the Suwanee River Valley culture developed. By the 16th century, the river was inhabited by two closely related Timucua-speaking peoples: the Yustaga, who lived on the west side of the river; and the Northern Utina, who lived on the east side. By 1633, the Spanish had established the missions of San Juan de Guacara, San Francisco de Chuaquin, and San Augustin de Urihica along the Suwannee to convert these western Timucua peoples. In the 18th century, Seminoles lived by the river. During the colonial period into the antebellum era, Black Seminoles lived near the river and allied with the Seminoles during times of war. The steamboat Madison operated on the river before the Civil War, and the sulphur springs at White Springs became popular as a health resort, with 14 hotels in operation in the late 19th century.  Swanee River  The Suwanee given as Swanee is the locale of the protagonists longed-for home in two famous songs: Stephen Fosters 1851 Old",

    "text": "Ooh La La in L.A. is a song by English rock band Slade, released in 1987 as the third single from their fourteenth studio album, You Boyz Make Big Noize. The song was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and was produced by John Punter.  Background  Slade began writing and recording material for their You Boyz Make Big Noize album in 1986. Hoping to record a hit album that would put them back in the public eye, You Boyz Make Big Noize was released in 1987, however both the album and its singles Still the Same and Thats What Friends Are For all failed to achieve the expected level of commercial success. During the summer of 1987, Ooh La La in L.A. was released as the albums third single, but mainly in Germany only, with CBS also releasing it in America as a promotional single. It was not a commercial success in Germany and did not achieve enough airplay on American radio, except in Los Angeles, to warrant CBS giving it a full release. The song would be Slades last release through RCA Records. Ooh La La in L.A. had been written during the time of the bands 1985 album Rogues Gallery. The lyrics, written by Holder, details the bands experiences in America while promoting their 1984 hit single Run Runaway. The song also refers to the brief headline news that drummer Don Powell was dating Bob Dylans daughter. In a 1987 fan club interview, guitarist Dave Hill picked the song as his favourite from the album, stating: There is something about the chorus on this one. It is a very different sort of song for Slade. The lyric is very autobiographical. One verse is about Don being pissed all the time. There is mention of the Sunset Marquee, where a lot of bands stay. There is a verse about Barneys Beanery, where we used to play pool all the time. In Russia, Ooh La La in L.A. remains one of the bands most popular songs. In a 2011 interview on Vintage TV, Hill said: Ooh La La in L.A. was never a hit for us, but in Russia its huge. And its a bit like how come its huge in this massive country and yet it didnt happen here?  Release  Ooh La La in L.A. was released on 7 and 12 vinyl by RCA Records across Europe. In America, it was released as a promotional-only 12 vinyl. RCA also released the single as a promotional-only release in Mexico, while a Japanese promotional single was also released, featuring Ooh La La in L.A. as the A-side and American band Autographs Loud and Clear on the B-side. The B-side on the German release was Dont Talk to Me About Love, which had previously appeared as a B-side on the double pack edition of the bands Still the Same single. On the 12 single, a second B-side, Thats What Friends Are For, taken from You Boyz Make Big Noize, was also included. The artwork for the single was the same as used for the earlier 1987 single Thats What Friends Are For.  Promotion  A music video to promote the single in America was planned if the promotional single gained sufficient airplay to warrant a full release of the single. In a fan club newsletter of the time, it was revealed that the video would be filmed in Los Angeles. However, the video did not come to fruition, with Lea stating in a 1987 fan club interview: Well, when you are dealing with record companies, it all comes down to money, power strokes and the way they think a record is going to go. CBS deliberately held back on doing the video because, although they could see it picking up a few heavyweight stations, they wanted to wait to see if it picked up any more. In the UK, the band performed the song on the ITV show Get Fresh in August 1987, while promoting their UK-only single You Boyz Make Big Noize.  Critical reception  Upon its release in the US, the radio trade magazine The Hard Report selected Ooh La La in L.A. as one of the frontrunners for radio play and considered it to show a whole new side to the band. They noted Holders distinctive delivery which almost offers a Collinsesque twist this time around and added, One has to marvel at how the vocal equivalent of the Grand Canyon can seemingly add even more gravel, complete with newfound trills, which weve certainly heard before. The reviewer concluded, Its got to be their widest demo offering ever, with a pop hook you know will cause havoc on both sides of the dial. An easy call for their biggest hit of the 80s. FMQB picked it as a sure shot and commented that, like their 1984 hits Run Runaway and My Oh My, the 1987 model of the mighty Slade machine hones in on roundhouse melodies, flawless production, and a sound that rocks but doesnt crunch. They noted the Roxanne-like rhythm guitar chords, Holders rabble-rousing voice and lyrics which take a witty look at life on the road in America from a Brits perspective. The magazine concluded, Slade just turned 21, and its hard-driving, good-humored boyz noize like this thats made them one of the most durable bands of t",

    "text": "The Cellar is a brand name used by Macys for departments commonly located on the first floor below ground level at larger stores. Although every Macys has such a department, only the larger flagships have basement-level space devoted to the Cellar concept. The concept was pioneered in 1971 as a gourmet kitchenware marketing concept in the San Francisco flagship store of the Macys West division. In 1974, the Macys West president Edward Finkelstein was promoted to the president of Macys New York and brought the Cellar concept with him. The Cellar theme covers appliances, fixtures, kitchenware, and tableware. Macys stocks a wide range of brands in the cellar, including upscale and gourmet brands, as well as two private labels: Tools of the Trade for cookware, cutlery, and kitchen gadgets; and The Cellar for flatware, dinnerware, and glassware. Finkelstein acknowledged that The Cellars design was influenced by other stores including Harrods, Pottery Barn, and Crate  Barrel. In August 2006, the Chicago flagships basement level transitioned to this concept in preparation from the September Marshall Fields conversion. It did so by posting the themed logos as pictured in its housewares department.  References",

    "text": "Complimentary elections for acting Federal Councilors of Switzerland members of the Swiss Government to the National Council lower chamber of the Swiss Parliament were held in the second half of the 19th century. They were meant to underline the popular support of the Federal Councilors which were elected by the National Councilors. In practice, the Federal Councilors did not take office as National Councilors after being elected but resigned and kept acting as Federal Councilors. The practice of complimentary elections began in 1854 and was discontinued in 1896.  Name  The name Complimentary election was coined in 1881 by Simon Kaiser, a member of the National Council from Solothurn. Before it was also called a Confidence Vote, or Courtesy Election as with these elections, the people of the canton of origin of the Federal Councilor were able to show the popular support which the Federal Councilor was able to count on.  Context  Article 77 of the Swiss Constitution mentions that neither members of the Council of States upper chamber of the Swiss Parliament nor members of the Federal Council Swiss Government are allowed to be also members of the National Council. Article 96 mentions that every citizen able to elected into the National Council can also be elected into the Federal Council. The same article also regulates that the Federal Council is to be newly elected after every election of the National Council. The Federal Councilors were not formally elected by the Swiss citizens, but the members of the National Council. If the Federal Councilor did not win the complimentary election, he was likely not going to be confirmed for another term by the National Council.  History  The practice of the Complimentary Elections began in 1854. Simon König introduced a motion into the National Council aiming to achieve a revision of the electoral law which would prohibit the Federal Councilors election into the National Council. Kaiser reasoned that the possibility of such an election was unconstitutional. His motion was mainly directed against by the candidacy to the National Council of the Solothurnese Federal Councilor Bernhard Hammer. The Federal Council responded in 1883 attempting to explicitly allow such elections. In March 1885, the issue was discussed in the National Council and its respective commission was also in favor to adapt the laws accordingly, but the law was eventually dismissed by the National Council and also the Council of States didnt raise the issue again. As the beginning of the end of the practice is seen the non-candidacy in 1887 by Adolf Deucher, from the Canton Thurgau. In later years, other Federal Councilors followed his example and also declined to become a candidate. The last candidate to the Complimentary Elections was Adrian Lachenal in 1896.  Notable examples   Stefano Franscini  In the 1854 elections to the National Council, Federal Councilor Stefano Franscini was not elected in his Canton of Ticino, who then was put forward as a candidate in the Canton of Schaffhausen, with members of his party strongly supporting his political positions. In Schaffhausen, he was elected and following also re-elected as Federal Councilor by the National Council.  Ulrich Ochsenbein  The Federal Councilor Ulrich Ochsenbein lost to Jakob Stämpfli in October 1854, who then in December the same year was elected into the Federal Council by the Nacional Council instead to Ochsenbein.  Wilhelm Naeff  Wilhelm Naeff was more lucky, as after he was not able to win the elections in 1866, he just didnt become a candidate in the next elections and was re-elected to the Federal Council anyway, even though with slim margins.  Josef Martin Knüsel  Josef Martin Knüsel was a candidate in 1866, 1869, 1872 and 1875. Until the last time, he won all elections comfortably, but in the last one he lost and resigned before awaiting the verdict of the National Council.  References",

    "text": "EagleAI NETwork pronounced Eagle Eye is an electoral roll management system that conservative activists use to file mass challenges to voter registration in the United States. It is considered an alternative to the bipartisan, non-profit Electronic Registration Information Center ERIC which is run by professional election administrators. Critics describe EagleAI as a way for private citizens to challenge voter registrations using reliable data that highlights issues that professional election workers would not know to dismiss, improving the overall process. NBC News describes the tool as voter fraud vigilantism. Cleta Mitchell, former legal advisor to Donald Trump and founder of the Election Integrity Network, is associated with the nationwide attempt to rollout EagleAI as a replacement for ERIC. Unlike ERIC, EagleAI does not actually use artificial intelligence, as the AI in its name is intended to be pronounced as eye.  Background  In January 2022, The Gateway Pundit, a far-right fake news website responsible for promoting Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories, Parkland high school shooting conspiracy theories, and COVID-19 misinformation, began spreading election conspiracy theories claiming that the non-profit Electronic Registration Information Center ERIC was inaccurate and favored registered Democrats. ERIC is a bipartisan collaboration between Republicans and Democrats to maintain the accuracy of voter registration. In response to these conspiracy theories, nine states run by Republicans withdrew from ERIC. President Donald Trump later joined in on the attack on ERIC, calling it, according to Politico, a liberal plot to control the countys voter rolls. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows later described the right-wing attack on ERIC as a disinformation campaign. An analysis by NPR news in 2023 concluded that the Gateway Pundit was the instigator for the entire ERIC controversy. Michael Waldman of the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law notes that after the Gateway Pundit spread this rumor about ERIC and GOP-led states began withdrawing from participation, conservative activist Cleta Mitchell began promoting the use of EagleAI in place of the ERIC system. Mitchell is notable for trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results.  Creation  In response to concerns about the 2020 election, retired physician John W. Rick Richards, and his son John Richards created EagleAI pronounced Eagle Eye in 2022 in Augusta, Georgia. USA Today reported that Richards said he was motivated to create the program when he downloaded the Georgia secretary of states voter rolls and allegedly found people who should not have voted. When questioned about this alleged voter fraud, Richards was unable to provide evidence to support it and said he no longer has the records. Richards says he named the program after the Eagle Scouts, a prestigious rank in the Boy Scouts of America. When asked about the resemblance to Operation Eagle Eye, a voter suppression campaign run by the Republican National Committee in the 1960s to help Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election, Richards denied any connection.  Description  Richards states that EagleAI is a non-partisan tool used to review voter lists. Unlike ERIC, which relies on accurate and reliable government-provided data, EagleAI uses public data and connects with Republican groups like the Voter Reference Foundation VoteRef which reveals voter information. In promotional literature, EagleAI previously claimed to use AI and multitiered algorithms to run its program, but Richards later admitted that there is no AI involved. EagleAI flags voter registrations for what it calls irregularities, which then delivers the alerts to GOP activists who submit the registration challenges to local voting officials on an election board. The Associated Press reported that the database of suspicious voters is created by conservative activists.  Election Integrity Network  Senior legal fellow Cleta Mitchell of the Conservative Partnership Institute CPI, a former legal advisor to Donald Trump, was the founder of the Election Integrity Network. Compass Legal Group, the in-house legal compliance firm for CPI, and one in which Mitchell is a beneficial owner of, helped filed paperwork for Valid Vote, a non-profit arm of EagleAI. According to The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, Richards, EagleAIs CEO, frequently speaks during Zoom calls hosted by Cleta Mitchell. Mitchell worked with the North Carolina Election Integrity Team NCEIT in March 2023 to host a demonstration of EagleAI. According to NBC News, Jim Womack of NCEIT said Mitchell was working with Richards directly on the programs national rollout plan. In 2024, The Guardian independently confirmed Mitchells direct relationship with EagleAI when it was able to review training videos. They reported that",

In 1955 the club entered into professional football in the Tweede Divisie, but failed to make a breakthrough in the local football fanbase, experiencing very low turnouts during those years. Such issues, coupled with a budget far lower than all other professional clubs, led the Dutch Football Federation to exclude Baronie from the league in 1971. Since then, Baronie has played at amateur level, winning six times the Hoofdklasse title.

Dent, the owner of the Everymans Library. It was based on another foundry-type made for this publisher. Both founts were based on an old Venetian roman type made by Nicolas Jenson. The typeface was launched in 1912 in a collection of the poems of Lorenzo De Medici which was published by Ballantyne Press. This font was also the basis for William Morris and his Golden Type. Dent admired Morris and his Golden type, and the way Morris tried to implement his ideas on printing. Dent however wanted to use machines to produce the type for his trade editions for his Everymans Library. In this way he was able to take Morriss socialist principles in a more practical way, compared with the bibliophile editions of the Klemscott press. The font Monotype produced was almost a copy of Golden Type, but with sharper slab serifs, and cleaner lines. A lighter version was produced in 1919 after the First World War, with bracketed serifs, and named Italian Old Style series 108. In 1967 Series 59 was taken out of production and all patterns, designs and punches were destroyed. After this date no new mats could be made, although Series 108 is still available. However, several digital fonts based on Veronese are currently available.  References",

At the age of fifteen, his interest into art developed after his father gave him some art magazines. Following Brignoni attempted to copy some of the works he saw. From 1919 onwards, he attended the School of Arts and Crafts in Bern, where he mainly studied art with Victor Surbek. In 1921, the family settled to Bellinzona where his father became the deputy director of the Swiss Post. Since he made trips to the nearby Milano in Italy, to study the buildings and museums of the city. He chose not to attend the art academy of Milano as he deemed it too conservative. He then continued his studies at the Academy of Arts, Berlin. In Berlin he visited the museums and got to know the German expressionism and Russian constructivism. In 1923 he went to study in Paris at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, where he met Alberto Giacometti, Picasso, and other avant-gardists, and where he was first exposed to African art.  Professional career  He worked at the Atelier 17 studio. He began collecting these artworks in 1926 and expanded the scope of his collecting to Melanesian and Indonesian art; he also supported himself in part through sales of these works. During this period he was also active in his own works, which were Surrealist and Primitivist in character. He joined Gruppe 33, an anti-Fascist association of artists based in Basel, and was represented in the 1935 and 1936 Surrealist exhibits in Copenhagen. He married Chilean painter Graciela Aranis 1906-1996 in 1935. In 1940 he was forced to return to Switzerland due to World War II, leaving his own work and his collection behind. Much of the former was lost to theft or destroyed, but the collection was held up by French customs, and was preserved intact, and at the end of the war he was able to retrieve it. He resumed his collecting after the war, eventually donating the collection to the city of Lugano in several phases beginning in 1985. He continued to work in a variety of media including sculpture, lithography, collage and painting; he also taught at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zürich. He painted several murals, including one at the Government Headquarters in Bellinzona 1958 and another in the television headquarters in Comano 1975. His works were widely exhibited, including a 1997 retrospective show at the Kunstmuseum Bern. He died in that city in 2002, survived by his second wife Marlyse Haller.  References",

    "text": "U.S. Route 421 US 421 in the U.S. state of Kentucky is a 250.536-mile-long 403.199 km northsouth United States highway that traverses twelve counties in the central and eastern parts of the state. It travels in a southeast-to-northwest path from the Virginia state line near Pennington Gap to the Indiana state line, on the Ohio River at Milton, Kentucky and Madison, Indiana.  Route description   Virginia state line to Manchester  US 421 enters Harlan County from Lee County, Virginia, and meets US 119 near Harlan. At Hyden, US 421 turns westward towards Clay County, and crosses the Hal Rogers Parkway via an overpass without access near Manchester.  Manchester to Richmond  At Manchester, US 421 turns northwestward towards Jackson County, through McKee. It traverses the far northeastern corner of Rockcastle County before entering Madison County where it joins U.S. 25 south of Richmond near the Blue Grass Army Depot. US 25 and US 421 runs concurrently through Richmond, and all the way to the I-75 junction.  Metro Lexington to Frankfort  US 25421 also runs concurrently with I-75 between Exits 97 and 99. After Exit 99, the two U.S. routes continue to run concurrently until downtown Lexington just after crossing US 276068. While US 25 makes a right turn onto Georgetown Road, US 421 continues straight northwestward, as Leestown Pike, towards Midway and Frankfort.  Frankfort to Ohio River  In Frankfort, US 421 has concurrencies with US 60 on the east side of town, and US 127 on the north side. US 421 continues northwestward into Henry and far northern Shelby counties before crossing the Exit 34 exit of I-71. US 42 in Bedford is the last major intersection in Kentucky before US 421 crosses the Ohio River from Trimble County into Jefferson County, Indiana.  History  US 421 did not have any presence in Kentucky until it was extended into Kentucky and Indiana at one point between 1939 and 1957, probably in the late 1940s or early 1950s. When US 421 was designated into Kentucky, it was routed onto the following existing routes: KY 66 from the Virginia state line to Harlan, KY 257 from Harlan to Hyden, KY 80 from Hyden to Manchester, KY 21 from Manchester to Big Hill, KY 169 from Big Hill to Richmond including US 25 concurrency, KY 50 from downtown Lexington to Frankfort, and KY 37 from Frankfort to the Indiana state line at Milton.  Current statuses for original assignments of pre-existing routes  KY 37 now runs from Gravel Switch to Junction City to Danville, in Marion and Boyle Counties in Central Kentucky. The remainders of KY 21, KY 169, and KY 257 still retained their original alignments off the current US 421. KY 50 no longer exists in the state route system. KY 66 is now assigned to a road in Bell, western Leslie and eastern Clay Counties in southeast Kentucky from Middlesboro to US 421KY 80 near Big Creek  Major Intersections   See also  U.S. roads portal List of roads in Lexington, Kentucky  References   External links  US 421 at Kentucky Roads",

    "text": "First Act was a manufacturer of musical instruments and musical learning toys, that produced guitars, bass guitars, guitar and bass accessories, drum sets, percussion instruments, and amplifiers. Mark Izen founded the company in 1995; its online presence first appeared early in 2000. Despite being officially based in Boston, Massachusetts, at its peak First Act maintained offices in Bentonville, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, and a custom shop luthiery in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 2016, First Act was acquired by toy manufacturer Jazwares.  Founding  First Act was largely an unrelated result of the successful sale of Duracraft to the Consumer Products division of Honeywell in 1996. Bernard Chiu, the founder of Duracraft, was offered a leadership role at First Act, Inc. after selling his company; he accepted, thus establishing the companys leadership hierarchy. As a significant portion of First Act, Inc. leadership were previous Duracraft employees, there were no dedicated musicians. Instead, they relied on their experience with generic commodity-level small appliances.  Product lines  The companys products were divided into two lines, with very similar entries but sold toward different audiences. They were marketed through large retail chains, particularly Toys R Us and Target, as well as Amazon.com. First Act proper was shaped toward inexpensive beginner instruments intended for children and adults. The small range was primarily a basic three-piece drum kit, a soprano ukulele, three dynamic-type microphones, and five guitars, both full-size acoustic and electric and short-scale marketed both as sized for kids and as a travel guitar. Paralleling this line was First Act Discovery sometimes just Discovery, musical products for children ages 3 to 9. This line included acoustic guitars, ukuleles, drums, electronic percussion pads, tambourines, recorders, keyboards, and electronic button-controlled guitars. There was also a series of plastic microphone-like products, largely with sounds and graphics licensed from Disney, including Nickelodeon, DreamWorks, and Marvel properties. More recently, to maximize the ukulele fad, a series of Disney-graphic instruments albeit marketed as mini guitars was released, such as the AV285 Avengers uke. An ambitious series of projects and products was eliminated after First Acts 2012 peak. First Act Instruments  the original retail line of entry-level instruments for teens and adults, including guitars, drums, hand percussion, and accessories. Mark II  intended in First Acts early years to become the quality line. The name isnt mentioned after 2003. Concert Series  a range of inexpensive band instruments marketed to grade-school students. 222  in 2008, First Act partnered with Adam Levine lead vocalist and guitarist of Maroon 5 to produce 222 by First Act, a line of 22 music products, including an acoustic guitar and a signature model of electric guitar designed by Levine, branded 222 his lucky number. The line was sold through Target stores. Fuel  successor to First Act Instruments, intended to distance this chain store presence largely Walmart and Target from the companys expanding quality lines. Studio For Artists SFA  designed and built custom guitars and violins for professional musicians. Each instrument was handcrafted, and finished in First Acts Boston studio. SFA Edition Guitars  standard First Act guitars with added custom appointments, such as premium pickups, upgraded machine heads, and unique pickguards. Limited Edition Guitars  three Limited Edition models were created in the SFA facility: the Lola, Sheena, and Delia. Guitar Player magazine praised the instruments for their stylistic innovation, unique appearance and excellent workmanship.  Related facilities  First Act Guitar Studio was a real-world storefront at 745 Boylston Street, Boston, offering various First Act Custom, Limited Edition, SFA Edition, and First Act series electric and acoustic guitars, and accessories. Customers could play the guitars, watch a luthier crafting custom guitars, see a live show, or have their guitar serviced.  Endorsers and users  In 2011, the First Act website claimed endorsements from 136 guitar players, including Brad Whitford Aerosmith, Rusty Anderson Paul McCartney, Matt Pike High on Fire, Lyn-Z Mindless Self Indulgence, Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher Mastodon, Nick Zinner Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Al Berry Avril Lavigne, Nick McCarthy Franz Ferdinand, Lee Malia Bring Me the Horizon, Dave Knudson Minus the Bear, Anders Björler At The Gates, Adam Gardner Guster, Tim McTague and James Smith Underoath, and Serj Tankian System of a Down.

Chinese: 百润股份, SZSE: 002568. Rio is a member of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association, and was inducted in 2010. Along with Breezer, Rio is one of the largest alcopop producers in China where both the brands share a combined two-thirds of the alcopop market in China. Rio generated revenue of 365 million yuan US59 million in the first half of 2014. In 2016, Bacchus reached a partnership with Veolia Water Technologies China.  Background and naming  The founder of Rio was present at a wine tasting event in Singapore. However, in the 1990s, most alcohol brands used only single wine-based ingredients. He was puzzled by the few types of juices that could form a good taste with alcohol. He then studied chuhai cocktails in Japan to suit the tastebuds of Asians before launching the product in 2003. Unlike its Japanese counterparts, Rio was sold in glass bottles instead of aluminium cans as the founder believed that cocktails are better received by consumers when packaged in glass. The brand was given the name Rio to evoke the tropical feel of Brazils Rio de Janeiro.  Marketing  Rio is the title sponsor for multiple Chinese dramas, movies and variety shows. Rios products are endorsed in the shows, which include drama Boss  Me, Love O2O, top variety show Keep Running and many more. Yang Yang and Amber Kuo are currently the spokespersons for Rio, succeeding Zhou Xun.  Lawsuit  In 2017, Bacchus filed an action with the Beijing Dongcheng District Peoples Court against Tonghua Dongte Wine Co., Ltd. for unfair competition in which the former claims of Dongtes BIO series has infringed its RIO series appearance and packaging. The court hearing rendered Bacchus with compensations of RMB 3 million in damages.  References",

    "text": "Lustration in Central and Eastern Europe is the official public procedure of scrutinizing a public official or a candidate for public office in terms of their history as a witting confidential collaborator informant of relevant former communist secret police, an activity widely condemned by the public opinion of those states as morally corrupt due to its essential role in suppressing political opposition and enabling persecution of dissidents. Surfacing of evidence for such a past activity typically inflicts severe damage to the reputation of the person concerned. It should not be confused with decommunization, which is the process of barring former communist regular officials from public offices as well as eliminating communist symbols. The principle of non-retroactivity means that a past role of a confidential collaborator informant is alone as such inadmissible from the beginning for criminal prosecution or conviction, thus, lustration allows at least to bring such past collaborators to moral responsibility by making the public opinion aware of the established outcomes through their free dissemination. Another motivation was the fear that undisclosed past confidential collaboration could be used to blackmail public officials by foreign intelligence services of other former Warsaw Pact allies, in particular Russia. Depending on jurisdiction, either every positive result or only the one obtained regarding a person who falsely declared otherwise may trigger consequences varying greatly among jurisdictions, ranging from mere infamy to purging the person from office and a 10-year exclusion from holding public offices. Various forms of lustration were employed in post-communist Europe.  Etymology  Lustration in general is the process of making something clear or transparent, usually by means of a propitiatory offering. The term is taken from the ancient Roman lustratio purification rituals.  Policies and laws  After the fall of the various European Communist governments with the Revolutions of 1989 between 1989 and 1992, government-sanctioned policies of mass disqualification of those associated with the abuses under the prior regime were initiated as part of the wider decommunization campaigns. Lustration in turn targets former confidential informants of the communist secret police who remain in or apply for political positions or even civil service positions, rather than former communist regular officials. In some countries, however, lustration laws did not lead to indiscriminate exclusion and disqualification, taking into account that people were often blackmailed to become informants or coerced into providing information without realising its true recipient. Lustration law in Hungary 19942003 was based on the exposure of compromised state officials, while lustration law in Poland 19992005 depended on confession. Lustration law is a special public employment law that regulates the process of examining whether a person holding certain higher public positions collaborated confidentially with the repressive apparatus of the communist regime. The special nature of lustration law refers to its transitional character. As of 1996, various lustration laws of varying scope were implemented in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, Poland, and Romania. As of 2019, lustration laws had not been passed in Belarus, nor in former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Central Asian Republics Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.  Results  Lustration can serve as a form of punishment by anti-communist politicians who were dissidents under a Communist-led government. Lustration laws are usually passed right before elections, and become tightened when right-wing governments are in power, and loosened while social-democratic parties are in power. It is claimed that lustration systems based on dismissal or confession might be able to increase trust in government, while those based on confession might be able to promote social reconciliation. There are, however, some paradoxal side effects of the process. For example, in spite of the fact that some informants were coerced or blackmailed into collaboration and may thus be also considered victims themselves, or in some cases despite terminating later the collaboration in favor of genuine dissident activity, the public attention and condemnation has focused primarily on them rather than on the communist government officials or secret police officers. Moreover, if the past collaboration is contested in a court, the verdict depends to some extent on testimonies of former communist secret police officers who engaged with the alleged informant, thus making those orchestrating the repressions de facto the ones deciding the case.  Examples   In Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic  Unlike many neighbouring states, the new government in the Czech and Slovak Fede",

He obtained many indecent images and videos of boys by pretending to be a teenage girl in order to trick them into sending the images and videos of themselves and other children. He blackmailed his victims into sending more extreme images and videos of themselves and in some cases of them sexually abusing other children. Wilson was arrested three times by the National Crime Agency before adequate evidence was gathered to prosecute him.

    "text": "Bao Bolong also Baobolong, Bao Bolon or Baobolon Wetland Reserve is a protected area in The Gambia. Established in 1996, it covers 296.5 square kilometres. The Wetland Reserve is located on the north bank of the River Gambia, approximately 100 km 52 nautical miles from the river mouth. The name is derived from the Bao Bolon tributary that rises in Senegal and enters the River Gambia. It extends from the River Gambia north to the Senegalese border along the Baobolon tributary.  History  On 1 January 1993, an area of 35 km2 was first declared as Bao Bolong National Reserve. From 16 September 1996 on, it has covered an extended area of 220 km2 200 km2 according to other sources. It was the first reserve in the Gambia to be acknowledged as a wetland area worthy of protection according to the Ramsar Convention. Since 1975, this convention, whose draft had been initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO, protects the habitat of water birds and Charadriiformes. For other nature reserves in the country, such as Tanbi Wetland Complex or Niumi National Park NNP, a Ramsar acknowledgement is also being aimed at by the Gambian authorities. As with NNP, it is intended to extend Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve across the border and to jointly administrate the area with Senegalese authorities.  Geography  The reserve features a length of 22 kilometres and an approximate width of nine km. The western part is located in the Central Baddibu district while the eastern part adheres to Upper Baddibu, both of which belonging to the North Bank Division. Chiefly, the reserve is made up of the river Bao Bolongs estuary, one of the bigger tributaries of the river Gambia. It is located about 100 km away from the Gambias mouth into Atlantic Ocean. The roughly 100 km long Bao Bolong rivers spring is situated in Senegal. Furthermore, BBWR includes the rivers Salokini Bolong, Mandon Bolong, Duntu Malang Bolong, Tanku Bolong and Katchang Bolong. The Gambia river thereby formes the southern boundary of the protected area. Approximately two kilometres away on the opposite bank of the river, the roughly 115 km2 large Kiang West National Park is located. A some two and a half kilometres wide zone of dense mangrove forest adjoins to the river. To the west lies the town of Salikenne population about 4,000, which is also located near the Dobo Forest Park of 7.32 km2. At the western border, the Jalabiro Forest Park of 0.59 km2 can moreover be found. The northern edge is bordered by the north bank road, Gambias secondmost important highway. Along this road and the fork to Salikenne, several smaller towns like Nja Kunda, Minti Kunda, Kekuta Kunda, No Kunda, Konti Kunda Sukoto, Konti Kunda Nji and Illiassa are situated. In the east, following a fork of nine km length from the north bank road, the town of Katchang of 1,700 residents can be reached. Farafenni, with a population of more than 30,000 being the divisions largest city, lies roughly 18 km outside the outer limits of BBWR to the east. Summed up, there are 25 small towns which are situated at the wetland reserves boundaries, one among them being inside the park limits proper. The inhabitants of these towns conduct fishery for personal requirements and their stock graze inside BBWR. Furthermore, they collect timber and fire wood there. The terrain is flat, the highest elevation is cited with 12 metres above mean sea level.  Flora and fauna   Ecosystems  Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve includes a rich fauna and flora within multiple ecosystems. Important, protected tree species are pointed out by the Ramsar Information Sheet, such as Pterocarpus erinaceus, Parinari macrophylla, the ana tree, wild mango trees Cordyla africana and Néré Parkia biglobosa.  Mangroves  Only in the mangrove forest of Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve the mangrove trees of the Senegambia region reach a height of 20 metres. The species Rhizophora racemosa, red mangrove Rhizophora mangle and black mangrove Avicennia germinans are widespread among them.  Saltmarsh  In the salt marshes, e.g. the succulent Sesuvium portulacastrum and grasses like Sporobolus spicatus, Paspalum vaginatum as well as Diplachne fusca can be found. In the savanna, which at times is flooded, Phragmites karka, Echinochloa pyramidalis and paper reed are very common.  Savanna  In the savanna, trees like Daniellia oliveri, Terminalia albida, Bombax costatum and others are to be found. Among the shrubs one will encounter several species of figs, Physostigma thonningii, Terminalia avicennioides, Anthostema senegalense and Nauclea latifolia. For grasses, Andropogon tectorum and Gamba grass Andropogon gayanus, Beckeropsis uniseta and Pennisetum subangustum are common.  Birds  The Gambia is frequently visited by ornithologists as more than 540 species of birds have been described there in topic literature. The reserve has been desig",

    "text": "Spalting is any form of wood coloration caused by fungi. Although primarily found in dead trees, spalting can also occur in living trees under stress. Although spalting can cause weight loss and strength loss in the wood, the unique coloration and patterns of spalted wood are sought by woodworkers.  Types  Spalting is divided into three main types: pigmentation, white rot, and zone lines. Spalted wood may exhibit one or all of these types in varying degrees. Both hardwoods deciduous and softwoods coniferous can spalt, but zone lines and white rot are more commonly found on hardwoods due to enzymatic differences in white rotting fungi. Brown rots are more common to conifers, although one brown rot, Fistulina hepatica beefsteak fungus, is known to cause spalting among deciduous trees.  Pigmentation  Pigmentation is caused when fungi produce extracellular pigments inside wood. Bluestain is also a form of pigmentation; however, bluestain pigments are generally bound within the hyphae cell walls. A visible color change can be seen if enough hyphae are concentrated in an area. Pigmenting fungi classified as spalting fungi do decay wood, they simply do so at a slower rate soft rotting than white rotting fungi. The most common groups of pigmentation fungi are the imperfect fungi and the ascomycetes. Mold fungi, such as Trichoderma spp., are not considered to be spalting fungi, as their hyphae do not colonize the wood internally and they do not produce the enzymes necessary to digest the wood cell wall components.  White rot  The mottled white pockets and bleaching effect seen in spalted wood is due to white rot fungi. Primarily found on hardwoods, these fungi bleach by consuming lignin, which is the slightly pigmented area of a wood cell wall. Some white rotting can also be caused by an effect similar to pigmentation, in which the white hyphae of a fungus, such as Trametes versicolor Fr. Pil., is so concentrated in an area that a visual effect is created. Both strength and weight loss occur with white rot decay, causing the punky area often referred to by woodworkers. Brown rots, the unpleasing type of spalting, do not degrade lignin, thus creating a crumbly, cracked surface which cannot be stabilized. Both types of rot, if uncontrolled, will render wood useless.  Zone lines  Dark dotting, winding lines and thin streaks of red, brown and black are known as zone lines. This type of spalting does not occur due to any specific type of fungus, but is instead an interaction zone in which different fungi have erected barriers to protect their resources. They can also be caused by a single fungus delineating itself. The lines are often clumps of hard, dark mycelium, referred to as pseudosclerotial plate formation. Zone lines themselves do not damage the wood. However, the fungi responsible for creating them often do. Spalted wood is also sometimes known as web wood.  Conditions  Conditions required for spalting are the same as the conditions required for fungal growth: fixed nitrogen, micronutrients, water, warm temperatures and oxygen. Water: Wood must be saturated to a 20 moisture content or higher for fungal colonization to occur. Wood placed underwater lacks sufficient oxygen, and colonization cannot occur. Temperature: The majority of fungi prefer warm temperatures between 10 and 40 C, with rapid growth occurring between 20 and 32 C. Oxygen: Fungi do not require much oxygen, but conditions such as waterlogging will inhibit growth. Time: Different fungi require different amounts of time to colonize wood. Research conducted on some common spalting fungi found that Trametes versicolor, when paired with Bjerkandera adusta, took eight weeks to spalt 1.5 inch 38 mm cubes of Acer saccharum. Colonization continued to progress after this time period, but the structural integrity of the wood was compromised. The same study also found that Polyporus brumalis, when paired with Trametes versicolor, required 10 weeks to spalt the same size cubes.  Commonly spalted woods  The Ohio Department of Natural Resources found that pale hardwoods had the best ability to spalt. Some common trees in this category include maple Acer spp., birch Betula spp. and beech Fagus spp.. However, recent research suggests that sugar maple Acer saccharum and aspen Populus sp. are preferred by both white rot and pigment fungi.  Common spalting fungi  One of the trickier aspects to spalting is that some fungi cannot colonize wood alone; they require other fungi to have preceded them to create favorable conditions. Fungi progress in waves of primary and secondary colonizers, where primary colonizers initially capture and control resources, change the pH of the wood and its structure, and then must defend against secondary colonizers that then have the ability to colonize the substrate. Ceratocystis spp. Ascomycetes contains the most common blue stain fungi. Other pigmenting fu",

The route serves to connect the rural communities of Cruso, Woodrow, and Bethel with the town of Canton entirely in Haywood County  Route description  NC 110 begins at the intersection of US 276 and NC 215 south of Canton. The road then runs north along Pisgah Drive. Shortly after the intersection the road crosses the Pigeon River and begins to parallel the river and NC 215. The road continues to run through a semi rural area until it reaches the town of Canton. Once reaching Canton the road continues to follow Pisgah Drive but makes a sharp left turn in the center of the city, as it reaches its northern terminus. Shortly after NC 110 reaches its northern terminus at US 19US 23.  History  NC 110 was first assigned as a bypass around the town of Newton. Shortly after the creation of the road US 70 was assigned to the entire length of the highway. In 1930 the road dissolved and was renumbered as NC 10A. The current NC 110 was built in 1932 as a new route stretching from NC 284 in Woodrow to US 19US 23NC 10 in Canton. Around 1938 NC 284 changed to the current routing of US 276.

    "text": "Barbara Mary Willard 12 March 1909  18 February 1994 was a British novelist best known for childrens historical fiction. Her Mantlemass Chronicles is a family saga set in 15th to 17th-century England. For one chronicle, The Iron Lily 1973, she won the annual Guardian Childrens Fiction Prize, a book award judged by panel of British childrens writers.  Life  Willard was born in Brighton, Sussex on 12 March 1909, the daughter of the Shakespearean actor Edmund Willard and Mabel Theresa Tebbs. She was also the great-niece of Victorian-era actor Edward Smith Willard. The young Willard was educated at a convent school in Southampton. Because of her family connections, Willard originally went on the stage as an actress and also worked as a playreader, but she was unsuccessful and abandoned acting in her early twenties. She wrote numerous books for adults before she turned to childrens literature. Very little about the author was written during her lifetime, because of her private nature. She died at a nursing home in Wivelsfield Green, East Sussex, on 18 February 1994.  Writing career  The Grove of Green Holly 1967, which was a story about a group of 17th century travelling players who were hiding in a forest in Sussex from Oliver Cromwells soldiers, spawned her most famous work, the Mantlemass series 19701981 including her Guardian Prize-winning book. Some other books were Hetty 1956, Storm from the West 1963, Three and One to Carry 1964, and Charity at Home 1965. One of her last books, The Forest - Ashdown in East Sussex, published by Sweethaws Press in 1989, gives a detailed account of Ashdown Forest. In the introduction to the book, Christopher Robin Milne notes that Willard had moved from her home on the Sussex Downs to the edge of Ashdown Forest in 1956 and that her new surroundings had provided the inspiration and setting for ten of her childrens historical novels eight in the Mantlemass series and two others. It is evident by her own account in her book that she actively involved herself in the affairs of the forest. She was a representative of the forest Commoners elected to the forests Board of Conservators in 1975, and she remained in that capacity for ten years. She tells how she was later heavily involved in the fundraising campaign which enabled East Sussex County Council to purchase the forest in 1988, enabling it to remain as a place of beauty and tranquility open to the public.

    "text": "The 1928 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1928 season. The 25th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League champion New York Yankees versus the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Yankees beat the Cardinals in four games to win their third championship and become the first team to do back-to-back sweeps. Babe Ruth hit .625 10 for 16 as the Yankees outscored their opponents by a combined score of 2710. As he had done against the Cards in the 1926 Series, Ruth hit three home runs over the right field pavilion in Sportsmans Park in Game 4, the only player to do it in two different World Series through the 2016 season. Unlike 1926, however, it occurred in the final game of a Series won by the Yanks and finished off their two consecutive World Series sweeps. Lou Gehrig also had a good Series, hitting .545 6 for 11 with four home runs. He drove in as many runs by himself 9 as the entire Cardinal team combined. His OPS of 2.433 is, through 2024, the highest World Series OPS of all time. Bill McKechnie became the second manager to lead two different teams to the World Series, and like Pat Moran before him, won one and lost one.  Background  Before the series started, Walter Johnson, a retired Major League pitcher at the time, reportedly predicted that the Cardinals would make short work of the New York Yankees, and that the Yankees hadnt looked good for a while. Both Cardinals and Yankees fans were looking forward to a rematch of the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won.  Summary  AL New York Yankees 4 vs. NL St. Louis Cardinals 0  Matchups   Game 1  In a fashion similar to 1926, Bill Sherdel took the mound in Game 1 for the Cardinals. Ruth doubled with 2 outs in the first inning. Gehrig followed with an RBI double. Ruth lashed another double in the fourth and scored ahead of Bob Meusels home run, one of only four hits off Sherdel in his seven innings. Consecutive singles by Mark Koenig, Ruth and Gehrig-for his second RBI-against Cards reliever Syl Johnson gave the Yankees the 4th run and a 10 series lead.  Game 2  The Cardinals produced 30 percent 3 of their runs in the Series in the second inning of game 2. George Harper walked, Jimmie Wilson doubled, Rabbit Maranville singled, and Grover Cleveland Alexander reached on second baseman Tony Lazzeris errant throw. It tied the game at 33. After that, George Pipgras allowed only two more Cardinal hits, walking 3 other St. Louis batters. Miller Huggins had helped him straighten out a delivery problem. Pipgras consistently struck out the Cardinals with his curveballs, and they didnt score again. New York went ahead 43 in the bottom of the second inning off Alexander, who did not do well after that. Ruth led off with a single. Gehrig, having homered earlier in the first inning to give the Yankees a 30 lead, drew a walk, and Meusel drove in a run with a double. A hit batsman and another run-scoring hit gave the Yankees a 4-run lead, and that was how it ended.  Game 3  The Redbirds, as the Cardinals were affectionately called by fans, led only 3 times the entire series and held an advantage in this game for 3 innings, the longest span in the series. They put up a 20 score in the 1st inning on singles by Andy High and Frankie Frisch, followed by a line drive that center fielder Cedric Durst couldnt catch, giving Jim Bottomley a 2-run double. The only other St. Louis run came in the 5th inning, when Taylor Douthit was hit by a pitch and scored to make it a 33 game on Highs double. Where the Cardinals had to scrape together runs, the Yankees did not. Gehrig homered into the right-field pavilion. In the fourth inning, Ruth laced a single and Gehrig followed with a hard line drive that skipped over the head of charging fielder Douthit. The ball rolled to the fence, and Gehrig went around the bases for a two-run inside-the-park homer. Ruth took to the bases again in the sixth inning when his grounder forced out Koenig. Gehrig then drew a walk. 3rd baseman High fielded Meusels bouncer and tried to start a double play. His throw got Gehrig at second, but Frischs relay went wild and rolled to the fence. As Bottomley scampered after the ball, Ruth rounded third base and headed for home. The throw beat him, and umpire Bill McGowan called him out, but the impact from Ruths hit in the collision jarred the ball loose from catcher Jimmie Wilson, and McGowan changed the call. Later in the inning, Meusel scored on a double steal. The Yankees scored another run that inning to make it 63. Another run in the seventh was their last of the game, making it 7-3.  Game 4  After Game 3, Cardinals manager Bill McKechnie was still hopeful, despite losing 3 games in a row. Itsic they can win three games, so can we. Nothing is impossible. And this thing isnt over until the fourth game is won, h",

The book consists of a series of short paragraphs describing incidents, as well as facsimiles of flyers, posters and graffiti. It also includes an interview with Greg Wadley, author of the zine Loser. The incidents detailed in How to Make Trouble date from the early colonial days to recent times, and include both explicitly political and non-political pranks. They include industrial disputes in the 1920s, recent environmental and anti-war protests, as well as acts of inspired vandalism and detournement. As such, this book can be said to be a testament to the larrikin tradition of Australia, and its numerous manifestations throughout history. Two sequels were released, How to Stop Whining and Start Living and Revenge of the Troublemaker. Each of these is attributed to the Question Mark Collective. It is believed that one of the compilers was Iain McIntyre. Iain McIntyre wrote and edited How to Make Trouble and Influence People: Pranks, Hoaxes, Graffiti, and Mischief-Making around Australia the most widely received installment in the series as well as maybe having edited Revenge of the Troublemaker: How to Make Trouble and Influence People Part 3 this has also led to him being the most, or even only, interviewed person related to these books. This puts him in a unique position to articulate the motive and ethos behind the books publications. Iain McIntyre is a writer and radio broadcaster from Melbourne, he has been involved in activism from the 1980s and still takes part in actions today. He has written and edited many books and pamphlets about Australias history and subversive cultures. McIntyre has also played several bands. Copies of these books may possibly be found in anarchist and countercultural bookshops in Australia. The book influenced the production of the ABC Radio Background Briefing program on Culture Jamming: How to Make Trouble and Influence People, broadcast in 1998 and also featured in Head Space No 4, the Australian Broadcasting Corporations monthly Arts and Culture Magazine.

    "text": "Frances McCollin October 24, 1892  February 25, 1960 was an American composer and musician, who was blind from early childhood. She was the first woman to win the Clemson Prize from the American Guild of Organists. In 1951, she was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania.  Early life and education  Frances McCollin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1892, the daughter of Edward Garrett McCollin and Alice Graham Lanigan McCollin. Her father, a lawyer, had studied musical composition in college, and he wrote and performed music as a side interest throughout his life. He was one of the founders of the Manuscript Music Society of Philadelphia. Her grandfather, George T. Lanigan, was an Irish-Canadian poet and journalist. Her younger sister, Katherine Williams McCollin Arnett, known as Kitty, was a singer and composer and the mother of Edward Arnett. When Frances McCollin was five years old, she became blind, probably from congenital glaucoma. Her parents and extended family took an energetic approach to her education at home, focused on music. When she started to compose in girlhood, her father was her first teacher and transcriber. As a child, she described sensations consistent with synaesthesia and perfect pitch. As a young woman she studied with fellow blind musician David Duffield Wood, the organist at St. Stephens Church in Philadelphia, and with William Wallace Gilchrist and H. Alexander Matthews at the Pennsylvania Institute for Instruction of the Blind.  Career  In her lifetime, McCollins works were performed frequently by professional and amateur vocal ensembles, and by orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Warsaw Philharmonic, the Vancouver Symphony, and others. She met Marian Anderson, Igor Stravinsky, Amy Beach, and other musicians and composers, usually in connection with her mothers work with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Fabien Sevitzky, Eugene Ormandy, and Leopold Stokowski took particular interest in her compositions. McCollin defended Stokowski programming The Internationale for a Philadelphia youth concert in 1934. Among the honors McCollin won a first prize from the Manuscript Music Society of Philadelphia in 1916, and the Philadelphia Matinee Musical Clubs annual prize in 1918. Also in 1918, she became the first woman to win the Clemson Prize from the American Guild of Organists, and the Kimball Company Prize from the Chicago Madrigal Club. In 1931 her composition Spring in Heaven won the Federation Prize from the National Federation of Music Clubs. In 1951, she was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania. She gave popular weekly lectures about the Philadelphia Orchestra programs, in which she focused on explaining modern compositions. She also hosted a weekly radio show for children, the Aunt Frances Music Hour. She conducted a girls choir at the School for the Blind in West Philadelphia, and the Girls Glee Club at Swarthmore College for one year 1923-1924. In 1943, the Philadelphia Orchestras Request Program featured works voted into the program by the public; Frances McCollins Pavane was included as a top vote-getter, the only winning composition by a woman.  Personal life  McCollin did earn some money from teaching, lecturing, and publishing royalties, but not enough to be financially independent. She never matured socially and intellectually; she was profoundly dependent on her family both financially and professionally. Throughout her life, she benefitted from transcription help from her family and from other local musicians including Vincent Persichetti, Jeanne Behrend, and Fabien Sevitzky who would go on to program her works when he conducted the Indianapolis Symphony. McCollin was in poor health in her last years, and lived with her sister Kitty who had married a doctor, John Hancock Arnett. When she died in 1960, aged 67 years, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra played a string quartet she composed at her memorial service. Her scores and other papers are archived at the Free Library of Philadelphia. Another collection of her papers is at the University of Pennsylvania.  Selected works  Among her compositions include: Now All the Woods Are Sleeping All Glory, Laud and Honor Christmas Fantasia, for organ Sleep, Holy Babe, for solo voice and string orchestra Come Hither, Ye Faithful, for choir Gods Miracle of May, trio for womens voices Pavane Spring in Heaven 1931 How Firm a Foundation, a chorale cantata based on the tune St. Denio 1943 Going Up to London, cantata for womens voices, flute obbligato, and piano accompaniment, text by Nancy Byrd Turner.

    "text": "The Laws of Cricket were substantially revised before the beginning of the 1774 English cricket season. The scorecards of five important matches have survived and there are reports of other senior matches, including two single wicket events. Hampshire did much better than in 1773, and were unbeaten in their known results to the end of July but then they lost twice to Kent in August.  Single wicket  Records have survived of three matches played under single wicket rules. The first on 67 June was a five-a-side match between Hampshire and Kent at Moulsey Hurst for a stake of 100 guineas a side. Lumpy Stevens and Samuel Colchin played as given men for Hampshire and John Minshull as one for Kent. Hampshire scored 118 and 127; Kent scored 21 and 36. Hampshire won by 188 runs. Tom Sueter with 74 in the second Hampshire innings scored more than both innings of Kent on his own. The Kentish Gazette on 22 June advertised a single wicket match at Sevenoaks Vine on 27 June for 100 a side between the Kent professionals John Wood i.e., the bowler from Seal and William Bullen of Greenwich. The outcome was not reported. On the same day, there was a five-a-side match between teams called Middlesex and London on Marylebone Fields. The stakes here were 20.  Scorecards  The scorecards of five senior matches, all involving Hampshire, have survived. In these five, Hampshire played twice each against England and Kent. The fifth match was against Surrey. Limited information about other matches has been found in contemporary newspapers.  England v Hampshire   22 to 24 June  Scorecard : Hampshire v England. The first match between Hampshire and England was played 22 to 24 June on Broadhalfpenny Down. Hampshire won by an innings and 52 runs England batted first and were dismissed for 122, of which Minshull scored 37. Hampshire responded with 307. The scorecard shows that nine Hampshire batters reached double figures, and the other two both scored 9. Their top scorers were Sueter 67 and John Small 47. In their second innings, England were all out for 133, Minshull scoring 38, and so Hampshire gained an innings victory. Scores and Biographies has Laleham Burway as the venue, but research by The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians ACS has confirmed that it was Broadhalfpenny Down. No bowling or fielding details are known, but Hampshires attack was strengthened by the addition of star bowler Lumpy as a given man.  8 and 9 July  Scorecard : England v Hampshire. The return match was played 8 and 9 July on Sevenoaks Vine. Hampshire won by 169 runs. Hampshire, batting first, scored 139. James Aylward 29 and George Leer 28 were their top scorers. Bowling for England, William Bullen took five wickets, all bowled. This is the first time that a bowler can definitely be credited with the 5wI feat. England were all out for 88 after Lumpy, Thomas Brett, and Nyren took two wickets apiece. Hampshire, with a first innings lead of 51, extended this to 233 by scoring 182 in their second innings. Aylward scored 61 and Sueter scored 30. In their second innings, England were dismissed for 64, Lumpy taking four wickets. Hampshire were greatly helped by having Lumpy as a given man. Both of John Wood Kent and John Wood Surrey were playing for England. One of them made the top score of 27 in Englands first innings, and one of them took three second innings wickets they might well have shared the wickets. However, it was definitely John Wood of Surrey who took a catch in the first innings. This was the final appearance in known senior matches by John Frame, the Kent fast bowler who was held by John Nyren to have been the other principal with Lumpy i.e., in opposition to Hambledon. His greatest years were behind him when the statistical record began he would have been 39 in 1772. He started playing in 1749. The bulk of his career was through the 1750s and 1760s and Scores  Biographies records him bowling for DartfordKent when they beat England twice in 1759.  Surrey v Hampshire   28 July  Scorecard : Surrey v Hampshire. Hampshire played two matches against Surrey. A scorecard has survived from the first on 28 July at Guildford Bason. Hampshire won by 7 wickets. There was an outstanding fast bowling performance in this match by Hampshires Thomas Brett, who took at least nine wickets i.e., nine were bowled out. Surrey were dismissed for 61 and 77, Brett bowling five in the first innings and four in the second. His 5wI is the second on record after Bullens haul three weeks previously. Bretts match haul of nine was the highest on record at this time. Will Palmer batted well in Surreys first innings, and made 26. Hampshire scored 91 and 483.  27 September  The second match was on 27 September at Laleham Burway. The result is unknown. It was advertised on Saturday, 24 September in the St James Chronicle. The stakes were 100 a side, and Surrey were to have Sam",

    "text": "Patit Punjabi: ਪਤਤ Gurmukhi is a term which refers to a person who has been initiated into the Sikh religion, but violates the religions precepts and leaves it. The term is sometimes translated as apostate.  Description  Its legal definition as inserted in the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, through the amending Act XI of 1944:: Patit means a person who being a Keshdhari Sikh, trims or shaves his beard or keshas or who after taking amrit commits any one or more of the four kurahits. Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971, contains a similar definition except a reference to keshdhari because unlike Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, it defines only keshdhari, and not sahajdhari, as Sikhs. It states: Patit means a Sikh who trims or shaves his beard or hair keshas or who after taking amrit commits any one or more of the four kurahits. In the Sikh Rehat Maryada, Section Six, it states: The undermentioned four transgressions must be avoided: Dishonouring the hair; Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the Kutha way; Cohabiting with a person other than ones spouse; Using an intoxicant such as smoking, drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs or tobacco These four kurahit causes of apostasy were first listed by Guru Gobind Singh.

The basic principles of Magi astrology were initially published in 1995 in the book Astrology Really Works! and further elaborated in the subsequent titles The Magi Society Ephemeris 19501999 Including Secrets of Magi Astrology 1996 and Magi Astrology: The Key to Success in Love and Money 1999, all published by Hay House.

Early life  Norah Doherty was born on 5 March 1878 at 13 Waltham Terrace in Blackrock, Dublin to John Doherty, a partner in a paper mill, and Charlotte Isabel Clarke. She moved to England with her family and by 1891 was living in London. Norah married Charles Richard Dacre Fox in 1909.  Political activity  Norah Dacre Fox was a prominent member of the Womens Social and Political Union and, by 1913, served as general secretary. Dacre Fox was an effective propagandist, delivering rousing speeches at the WSPU weekly meetings and writing many of Christabel Pankhursts speeches. In May 1914 Flora Drummond and Norah Dacre Fox besieged the homes of Edward Carson and Lord Lansdowne, both prominent Ulster Unionist politicians who had been inciting militancy in Ulster against the Home Rule Bill then going through Parliament. Drummond and Dacre Fox had both been issued with summonses to appear before magistrates for making inciting speeches and encouraging women to militancy. Their response to journalists who interviewed them was that they thought they should take refuge with Carson and Lansdowne who had also been making speeches and encouraging militancy in Ireland, but who appeared to be safe from interference from the authorities for doing so. Both women appeared before a magistrate, were sentenced to imprisonment and taken to Holloway Prison where they immediately commenced hunger and thirst strikes and endured force-feeding. From May to July 1914 she was imprisoned three times in Holloway for acts of terrorism; she received a WSPU Hunger Strike Medal with three bars. In the 1918 United Kingdom general election she stood as an independent candidate in Richmond Surrey; she received 20 of the votes but was not elected. The same year she campaigned for the internment of enemy aliens in collaboration with the British Empire Union and the National Party. Norah Elam stated in The Times that she was never a member of the Womens Freedom League contrary to some reports. Elam was a member of the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society LPAVS. During 1916 and 1917, Elam obtained work as supervisor of a typewriting pool at the Medical Research Council MRC, gaining information she was to use in articles published under the auspices of the LPAVS during 1934 and 1935. In March 1921, Elam advertised in The Times and chaired a public meeting of LPAVS at the Aeolian Hall in London to discuss The Dogs Bill a bill to prohibit the vivisection of dogs that was being debated in Parliament at that time. In 1932, the MRC had produced a paper called Vitamins, A Survey of Present Knowledge. Elams 1934 response was entitled The Vitamin Survey, A Reply and was a critical appraisal of that survey and its results. This was followed in 1935 by The Medical Research Council, What it is and how it works based on the same arguments about MRC research practices and remits as the first paper, but distilled and argued more cogently on a broader front. Elams argument was that powerful vested interests had managed to entrench themselves behind State-aided research, and had managed to make themselves unaccountable. These papers were widely distributed and copies could be found in libraries throughout the UK. By the 1930s, she had separated from her husband, and was living with Edward Descou Dudley Vallance Elam whose surname she generally adopted. They lived in Sussex where they were active in the local Conservative Party. However they defected to Oswald Mosleys British Union of Fascists BUF soon after its creation in 1932 and she became prominent in the womens section. During this time, she encountered Wilfred Risdon, Director of Propaganda 19334, who was later a colleague in the LPAVS. She was a frequent contributor to the fascist press and in November 1936 was put forward as the BUFs prospective parliamentary candidate for the Northampton constituency, but no general election was held during the Second World War. Mosley used her suffragette past to counter the criticism that National Socialism was anti-feminist saying that her prospective candidacy killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back in the home. In May 1940 Norah and Dudley Elam were detained under Defence Regulation 18B and she was interned in Holloway Prison with several other female fascists including Diana Mosley. After her release, Norah and Dudley Elam escorted Unity Mitford to see Diana and Oswald Mosley in Holloway on 18 March 1943.  Family  Elam had one son, Evelyn born 1922. Her granddaughter, Angela McPherson, described in a 2010 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Mother Was a Blackshirt, that she had no idea until 2002 of the role Elam played in the fascist movement. McPherson",

    "text": "The Montsec Range Catalan: Serra del Montsec Catalan pronunciation: ˈsɛra ðel monˈsɛk; Spanish: Sierra del Montsec is a mountain system of the Pre-Pyrenees.  Description  The Serra del Montsec consists of a series of calcareous mountain ranges running roughly from east to west. The range system is about 40 km long and 186.96 square kilometres in area. The Montsec is located in the Catalan province of Lleida and the Aragonese province of Huesca in Spain.  Geography  The name Montsec derives from the Latin Montus sectus, which makes reference to its characteristic rock formations. It marks the southern limit of the Pallars region and is divided into three main massifs by 3 of the most important rivers in Catalonia: Montsec de Rúbies, the eastern massif, is separated by the river Segre in the east and the Noguera Pallaresa in the middle, Montsec dAres, the central massif. Montsec dEstall, in Aragon, located to the west, separated by the Noguera Ribagorçana from the central massif. Two gorges congostos, those of Terradets and Montrebei, or Bonremei, have been opened by the action of the rivers and tectonic movements. The highest peak, Santalís, is found in the central massif, standing at 1,678 metres, and dominates views over Àger and the plains of Lleida to the south and the Pyrenees to the north. The southern face is virtually a great wall with a step about two-thirds of the way up, and the northern side, although by no means as steep, still stands at 1,000 metres above the Tremp basin below.  Geographical features   Formation  Montsecs formation goes back to when sediments of several thousand metres deep were deposited in the Cretaceous sea, raised and partly covered by the Eocene sea, and then raised again by Pyrenean folding. Fossils from the Mesozoic era are relatively easy to find, and at Vilanova de Meià the deposits there are one of the most important in the world.  History  Montsec stands in a natural defensive position over the plains and is relatively protected from the icy winds from the north, and as such its strategic aspect was very important in times of the Reconquista. In the 10th century, when the caliphate of Córdoba was at its height, Balaguer was the northernmost Arab city, and the castles of Castelló de Farfanya, Algerri, and Os de Balaguer were satellite fortifications which, together with a barrier of well-placed watch towers, formed the line of defense against the Christians to the north of Montsec. In the 11th and 18th centuries the area had one of the densest populations in Catalonia, but the population level began to fall at the beginning of the 20th century, and nowadays emigration is prominent and many villages are virtually abandoned. It is an area of natural interest, due to its caves, Astronomical Park, and activities, including kayaking, hiking, paddle-surfing, and gliding.  Economy  The difficulty of irrigation makes for a very limited agriculture in the area. Local farmers cultivate mostly some barley and almonds. Hydroelectric power is another resource but most of all planners are looking to tourist development to give the region an important boost.

    "text": "Mobilization for Justice MFJ  formerly MFY Legal Services, Inc. is a non-profit legal services and advocacy organization serving New York City. MFJ was founded in 1963 and became a model for using a holistic approach to community lawyering.  History  Mobilization for Justice has its roots in Mobilization for Youth MFY, a community-based social service initiative funded in 1962 by the Kennedy Administration, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Ford Foundation, and the City of New York, with the goal of enlisting the actionist and researcher in a joint program of social engineering organized to improve opportunities for youth and guide young people into pursuing them. MFY Legal Services, the legal unit of Mobilization for Youth was launched the following year in 1963 by Edward Sparer who advocated a new approach: Instead of piecemeal direct legal services in the Legal Aid tradition, most of MFY Legal Units resources should be channeled into targeted study and direct litigation designed to change the institutional structure that created and sustained poverty. He advocated the use of test cases as an early form of cause lawyering or impact litigation that would create new legal rights for the poor. Sparer identified specific issues in the welfare rights arena that were ripe for legal challenges including residency laws, violations of privacy, inadequate benefits and arbitrary welfare terminations  linking a litigation strategy to a social movement. MFY Legal Services became the prototype for storefront poverty law offices which opened in virtually every major American city. Its work was characterized by activism and aggressive advocacy. Examples of the work include supporting organizing campaigns that included rent strikes, education boycotts against school segregation and demonstrations at construction sites demanding jobs for people of color. In 1968, MFY Legal Services challenged the governments arbitrary cutoff of welfare benefits, which resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court landmark decision Goldberg v. Kelly, affirming the right of public benefits recipients to a fair hearing before benefits are terminated. Writing in The New York Times, Linda Greenhouse noted that Goldberg v. Kelly . . . proved to be . . . a critical building block in what came to be known as the due process revolution. A series of decisions that followed erected a constitutional shield for the ordinary citizen against the arbitrary or standardless use of governmental power in many contexts. In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act imposed restrictions and reduced funding to the Legal Services Corporation that provided MFY Legal Services funding leading to the closing of several neighborhood offices. These federal restrictions such as preventing representation of undocumented New Yorkers or prohibition on class actions lawsuits led to MFY splitting from Legal Services NYC. In June 2017, MFY Legal Services changed its name to Mobilization for Justice.  Services  Mobilization for Justice provides free services on pressing civil legal needs including matters regarding housing and foreclosure; consumer, bankruptcy, tax and employment; a variety of legal issues faced by the aged and people with mental illness and physical disabilities; government benefits and immigration; and legal issues that kinship caregivers and parents of children with disabilities struggle with, such as special education needs. They provide access through legal hotlines and neighborhood clinics.  Policy advocacy  Mobilization for Justice has led numerous campaigns to change and improve public policies and the administration of justice in the court system. Recent campaigns include: Campaign to Fight Sewer Service: MFJ identified the problem that people were being sued for debts without ever getting notices from the debt collectors. MFJ worked with NYC Council Member Daniel Garodnick and the NYC Department Consumer Affairs to pass legislation and enact rules to more strictly regulate process servers. Campaign to Protect Homeowners in Foreclosure: In 2011, MFJ issued Justice Deceived: How Large Foreclosure Firms Subvert State Regulations Protecting Homeowners, followed in 2012 by Justice Unsettled: How the Foreclosure Shadow Docket  Discontinuances Prevent New Yorkers from Saving their Homes. These reports brought public attention to the shadow docket issue, where foreclosure firms failed to move cases to a judges docket, allowed them to remain in limbo, while the banks rejected mortgage payments and charged homeowners fees and interest. The campaign helped eliminate the shadow docket. Three-Quarter House Reform: In 2010, the organization launched a public campaign to expose abuses in the three-quarter house industry with a rally, a lawsuit, and, with Neighbors Together, a community-based organization, organized the Three-Quarter House Tenant Organizing Project, which produced Three Quarter House",

    "text": "Sampling risk is one of the many types of risks an auditor may face when performing the necessary procedure of audit sampling. Audit sampling exists because of the impractical and costly effects of examining all or 100 of a clients records or books. As a result, a sample of a clients accounts are examined. Due to the negative effects produced by sampling risk, an auditor may have to perform additional procedures which in turn can impact the overall efficiency of the audit. Sampling risk represents the possibility that an auditors conclusion based on a sample is different from that reached if the entire population were subject to audit procedure. The auditor may conclude that material misstatements exist, when in fact they do not; or material misstatements do not exist but in fact they do exist. Auditors can lower the sampling risk by increasing the sampling size. Although there are many types of risks associated with the audit process, each type primarily has an effect on the overall audit engagement. The effects produced by sampling risk generally can increase audit risk, the risk that an entitys financial statements will contain a material misstatement, though given an unqualified clean audit report. Sampling risk can also increase detection risk which suggests the possibility that an auditor will not find material misstatements relating to the financial statements through substantive tests and analysis.  Types of sampling risk   Typical scenarios  Auditors must often make professional judgments in assessing sampling risk. When testing samples the auditor is primarily concerned with two aspects of sampling risk: Risk of accepting incorrect data: the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded account balance is not materially misstated when it is materially misstated. Risk of incorrect rejection: the risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded amount balance is materially misstated when it is not materially misstated. In addition, the auditor is concerned with sampling risk and its relationship with controls. Two types of sample riskcontrol risks are: Assessing too low: the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is less than the true operating effectiveness of the control. Assessing too high: the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is greater than the true operating effectiveness of the control.  Sample selection  When selecting a sampling approach there are two approaches to audit sampling: non-statistical and statistical approach. Three ways that statistical sampling can assist the auditor are: to maximize the productivity with minimum wasted effort in designing the sample, to measure the sufficiency of the evidence taken during the audit, and to analyze the results. The statistical approach allows the auditor to measure the risk that is being sampled to help in reducing it to an acceptable level. With respect to performing samples, statistical sampling involves different kinds of costs such as training the auditors, designing individual samples to meet the requirements, and choosing the items to be examined. If there is insufficient audit evidence it is the responsibility of the auditor to choose between non statistical or the statistical sampling approaches considering their effectiveness and related costs. Although exercising careful judgment is crucial during every step of the sampling process, it is extremely necessary when choosing the non-statistical approach. This method does not include the use of tables or statistical percentages, but rather it relies upon professional judgment on the part of the auditor as well as the policy implemented by the firm. Under this approach, it is common practice for most accounting firms to create universal guidelines for auditors in order to determine a proper sample size. For example, if a given clients control risk is high, a firm would typically require a high sample size when selecting records. In order to successfully gather a sample, it is important to consider the collection as a whole and the relevance of the particular items. The most common successful method is to select an even number of items which accurately represents the list as a whole. Selecting only large or small numbers could distort the sample which creates risk.  See also  Sample statistics Audit  References",

Career  She covered the early stages of Yugoslav wars and frequently visited front lines, including the city of Sarajevo while it was under siege. In 1992 she announced that she would no longer report from battlefields because she could not bear writing about the destruction of cities and the killing of children. She returned to Belgrade and started reporting on politics. One of her most famous pieces is a piece about Arkan, in which she describes how a criminal came to be promoted as a national prophet. The piece was written with much sarcasm and irony.  Death and aftermath  She was found dead in her apartment on 8 April 1994. The police ruled it a suicide, but most evidence disputes this. She was active the day before and made many plans for the future. The diaries of Ratko Mladić mentioned that he knew who murdered Dada implying that it was Goran Vuković and Duško Malović. This may help reopen an investigation into her death. The Serbian government began a review in January 2013 of several suspicious cases involving murders of journalists in the 1990s, including Dada Vujasinović, Slavko Ćuruvija, and Milan Pantić.

    "text": "Mikhail Ivanovich Budenkov Russian: Михаил Иванович Буденков; 5 December 1919  2 August 1995 was a Soviet sniper in World War II. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 March 1945 for killing 413 Nazis. By the end of the war he had killed 437 Nazis, making him one of the best snipers of the war.  Early life  Budenkov was born on 5 December 1919 to a Russian peasant family in Slavtsevo. After completing seven grades, he worked on a collective farm, then studied to become a ship mechanic. He worked on a ship that sailed on the Moscow Canal. He returned to his home village in 1939 to work as a tractor driver, but later that year he was drafted into the Red Army and stationed in Brest.  World War II  As soon as the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, Budenkov fought on the frontlines as a sniper in the 84th Rifle Regiment. Initially, he was a part of the retreat towards Moscow, but in September 1942, he assumed command of a mortar crew and, in his spare time, began working as a sniper. In May 1942 he was wounded, but after he was released from the hospital in August 1942 he was assigned to the 59th Guards Rifle Regiment and was made commander of a mortar company. He hunted as a sniper in his free time, and killed 17 enemy soldiers this way before requesting a transfer to a rifle company in the same unit to fight as a sniper. He had killed over 200 enemy soldiers by mortar fire in the battles for Velikiye Luki. He specialized as a sniper, but utilized a machine gun during an offensive. He was wounded again in June 1943, but recovered and returned to combat. By September 1943 he had killed 107 Nazis by sniper fire, and the end of December brought his kill count to 158. During a battle that month he replaced his company commander, leading an advance on a strategic height and holding it, repelling counterattacks and not retreating despite getting wounded again. By the end of the battle, only eight soldiers were left, all wounded. He later became the party organizer of his battalion, having become a member of the Communist Party in 1943. His accurate sniper fire killed enemy machine gun crews in the battles for the city of Madona, allowing the advance of Soviet troops. His squad commander described him as a born sniper, and on 25 March 1945 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. He received his gold star on 19 May at a ceremony in the Kremlin, and on 24 June 1945 he marched in the famous Victory Day Parade on Red Square. Shortly before victory he was sent to a military-political school, but he did not graduate because he was demobilized in December 1945 with the rank of senior lieutenant.  Later life  He worked as deputy director of the Lyakhovskaya Machine-Tractor Station, and in 1947 he graduated from party school in Vladimir and then in Ivanovo in 1951. He then moved to Melenki, where he worked at a flax mill. He died on 2 August 1995.

    "text": "Angelus of Jerusalem, OCarm Italian: SantAngelo; 1185  5 May 1220 was a Catholic convert from Judaism and a religious priest of the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance. Angelus and his twin brother became converts to the faith following their mothers conversion. Both went on to become ordained priests and Carmelite friars. Unlike his brother, however, he retreated into the desert to a hermitage after his ordination, but he emerged once he was instructed to go to the Italian mainland to evangelize as well as to meet with Pope Honorius III to have him approve a new rule for the Carmelites. He was slain whilst preaching and was believed a saint after his death. The Carmelites venerated him as such until during his pontificate Pope Pius II beatified the slain priest circa 1459.  Life  He was born in Jerusalem in 1185 to Jewish parents. His mother later converted to Christianity, and both he and his twin brother John were baptised into the Catholic Church when she converted. His parents died while Angelus and his brother were still children, and the Patriarch Nicodemus oversaw their education until the twins turned eighteen. At that age, he and his brother John entered the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel at the Saint Anne convent near the Golden Gate to commence their novitiate. The two could speak Greek as well as both Latin and Hebrew. In 1210, Angelus was ordained to the priesthood in Jerusalem and he travelled in Palestine. Miraculous cures were attributed to him around this time and his acta stated that he sought to avoid fame and withdrew to a hermitage in the desert when he was becoming popular for his miracles. He became a hermit on Mount Carmel when he was instructed in 1218 to leave for the Italian peninsula in order to preach against the patarini as well as the Albigensians and the Bulgars. He had likewise been instructed to go to Rome to obtain from Pope Honorius III confirmation of the new and definitive rule for the order later granted in 1226. Angelus was one of the first friars to come to Sicily from Mount Carmel. He set off on a Genoese ship on 1 April 1219 and stopped first in Messina before heading off to Civitavecchia before he ended up in Rome to meet with the pope. The friar preached in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran while in Rome where he met both Francis of Assisi and Dominic of Osma. It is said that he foretold that Francis would receive the stigmata while Francis foretold his premature death. From there, he was a guest of the Basilians in Palermo where he was for over a month before preaching in Agrigento for over a month before settling in Licata. He had healed seven lepers and the ailing Archbishop of Palermo Bernardo de Castanea while in Palermo. He settled on the Sicilian island though his fame as a wonderworker caused crowds to flock to him. He also had success in converting some Jews though most Jews in Palermo came to despise him for this since he himself was once Jewish. He wanted to convert a Cathar knight named Berenger known also in sources as Berengarius. Tradition states that Berenger was living in incest and that the friar convinced the knights companion to leave Berenger. Berenger became enraged and had him attacked in front of the church of Santi Filippo e Giacomo in Licata on 1 May 1220. He died of his wounds within the week of 5 May and according to tradition asked for his assassin to be pardoned while urging the faithful not to avenge his death. He was buried at Santi Filippo e Giacomo.  Veneration  His sepulcher at Licata became a site of pilgrimage. The Carmelites venerated him as a saint since at least 1456 and the cult received papal approval from Pope Pius II at some stage during the latters pontificate. In 1486, his remains were moved from a wooden casket to a silver urn before being moved to a more precious urn on 5 May 1623. In 1632 his relics were translated to the Carmelite Church, and are now housed at the Santuario della Madonna del Carmine in Catania; the ending of a plague in the Kingdom of Naples in 1656, was attributed to his intercession. Since 4 May 1626, he has been known as the patron saint for Palermo. Daniel Papebroch sets no great value on any of the three different acts or relations of his martyrdom, but gives long accounts of miracles attributed to his intercession since his death, and of the great veneration which is paid to him in Sicily, especially at Licata and Palermo. As he and Albert of Trapani were the first two saints in the Order to have a cult, they are frequently found in medieval Carmelite iconography alongside the Virgin Mary. In the Carmelite church of Santa Maria del Carmelo in Traspontina in Rome, there is a chapel dedicated to St. Angelus with an altarpiece by Giovanni Battista Ricci.

Parallel slowdown is typically the result of a communications bottleneck. As more processor nodes are added, each processing node spends progressively more time doing communication than useful processing. At some point, the communications overhead created by adding another processing node surpasses the increased processing power that node provides, and parallel slowdown occurs. Parallel slowdown occurs when the algorithm requires significant communication, particularly of intermediate results. Some problems, known as embarrassingly parallel problems, do not require such communication, and thus are not affected by slowdown.

    "text": "The Kingdom of Prussia and the United States began diplomatic relations in 1785 following the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, but formal relations were not established until 1797. Relations would eventually end with World War I when the U.S. declared war on Germany.  History  After the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, The Kingdom of Prussia became therefore one of the first nations to officially recognize the young American Republic after the Revolution. The Treaty was signed to promote free trade and commerce and became a benchmark for subsequent free trade agreements and treaties. In addition, the treaty demanded the unconditionally humane custody for war prisoners, a novelty at the time. The treaty was renewed in 1799 after negotiations with then-United States Ambassador to Prussia John Quincy Adams. While the U.S. did not have a formal mission to Prussia, the construction of the current embassy to Germany began after the appointment of Adams as the ambassador in Berlin which was the capital of Prussia at the time. On May 1, 1828, both countries signed a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation which revived both the original Treaty of Amity and Commerce and its renewal in 1799. The treaty after German reunification remained intact as the treaty was regarded as binding and its provisions served for adjustments for commercial relations between Germany and the United States. It was until the outbreak of World War I that the treaty came under question and was no longer in continuance. By the late 1840s through the 1860s, trade between both countries grew rapidly. In 1846, the United States, Prussia, and Bremen, then the main German harbor for the American trade, founded the Ocean Steam Navigation Company OSNC, directed against British maritime supremacy in the North Atlantic. In part, the company was subsidized by Prussia. In 1855, Prussian Secretary of Trade August von der Heydt remarked about trade with the U.S. describing the importance of the United States for us as a market for our products has grown by leaps and bounds from one year to the next, and to such a degree, that the customs duty of that nation is, for our own industrial interests, of greater importance than that of most other states. During the American Civil War, the Kingdom of Prussia sent military officers to observe the conflict, the most notable being Justus Scheibert. The officers studied Union and Confederate tactics, the use of rail networks, rifled muskets, and logistics. When the Prussian officers returned, they delivered reports that assessed the capability of both American armies to be subpar in performance, citing overreliance on frontal assaults and inefficient supply lines. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Kingdom of Hanover and Duchy of Nassau, were subsequently merged directly into the Kingdom of Prussia. From this point, Hanover and Nassau had relations with the United States as a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. From February 22 and March 11, 1902, Prince Henry of Prussia visited the United States arriving at Shooters Island, New York City with President Theodore Roosevelt. On February 25, Kaiser Wilhelm IIs yacht Meteor III, was christened by Roosevelts daughter Alice Roosevelt Longworth. Henry then traveled to Washington, D.C. visiting the White House for a state dinner, United States Capitol, attending a memorial service to pay respects to William McKinley who was assassinated in 1901. Henry would then take an extended train trip on a special rail car to the Southern and Western United States with stops at Lookout Mountain, and the Lincoln Monument in Chicago. Henry returned to the East Coast where he visited the state capitol in Boston, reviewed cadets at West Point, New York at United States Military Academy, and was the guest of honor at a reception at the Union League in Philadelphia. Prince Henry left through New York on the S.S. Deutschland. The visit originally planned to have Henry land in New York, take a train to Washington, D.C., where the Prince would pay his respects to President Roosevelt, visit Cincinnati and Chicago, then return to New York via Niagara Falls. Relations ended on February 3, 1917, when U.S. President Woodrow Wilson instructed Secretary of State Robert Lansing to notify the German Ambassador to the United States that all diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the German Empire were severed. On April 6, 1917, Wilson declared war on Imperial Germany.

    "text": "Balyakalasakhi transl. Childhood Companion is a 2014 Malayalam language film adaptation of the famous novel of the same name by Vaikom Muhammad Basheer. The romantic musical drama film was written and directed by debutante Pramod Payyannur and stars Mammootty, Isha Talwar, Meena, Seema Biswas, KPAC Lalitha and Mamukkoya in lead roles. The story revolves around childhood sweethearts Majeed Mammootty and Suhra Isha Talwar. Born to rich parents, Majeed falls in love with his not-so-affluent neighbour Suhra. After her fathers death, when Suhra struggles to make both ends meet, Majeed pleads with his father to sponsor her education. Refused, he wanders off to distant lands. Some of the other characters created by Basheer such as Ettukali Mammoonju and Ottakannan Pokker also appear in the film. The film has lyrics and music created by several leading masters including P. Bhaskaran, K. Raghavan, K. T. Muhammed, O. N. V. Kurup, Kavalam Narayana Panicker, Sreekumaran Thampi, and Basheer himself. The launch of the film edition of the novel Balyakalasakhi was done by Leela Menon who handed over the book to Fabi Basheer, wife of Vaikom Muhammed Basheer.  Cast   Production  Pramod Payyannur, a familiar name in Malayalam theatre and television, made his debut on the big screen with the film. Mammootty was chosen to play the lead in film by Pramod Payyannur. He said in an interview with Malayala Manorama, Vaikom is the home of the writer Basheer, the character Majeed and also the actor Mammootty. Only a person who knew that place closely could imbibe that character in both looks and expressions. That search ended in Mammootty. On being quizzed about the inspiration to choose Kolkata as the location of the film, when Vaikom Muhammed Basheer has not referred to any specific city in the novel, Pramod says that Kolkata is perhaps the only Indian metro that still retains its old world charm and that it perfectly matched the setting of the films backdrop. Besides, Basheer is believed to have written Balyakalasakhi during his brief stay at a house in Lower Chitpur Road in Kolkata, he explains. Two seasons were shot in Kerala and Kolkata, West Bengal. The team began shooting in August, 2013 at Perumbalam near Vaikom. Mammootty began filming for Balyakalasakhi at Kolkata in October, 2013. The 18-day schedule included various places such as Victoria Memorial, Chhote Lal Ghat, in front of Town Hall.  Reception  Metromatinee.com said even if it has some limits, it is a timeless and exciting classic, Mammootty as lovelorn Majeed is impressive but a lack of good chemistry with Isha Talwar is a letdown. Deccan Chronicle said that Mammootty excelled in the double role as Majeed and as Majeeds father.  Soundtrack  The film has lyrics and music composed by several leading masters in the field while the background score was composed by Bijibal. The first line of the song Thaamara Poonkaavanathil Thaamasikkunnoley has been mentioned in the novel by Basheer himself. An oral traditional song of the Muslims in Kerala, the songs lines were supplemented with lyrics penned by K. T. Muhammed. It has been sung by legendary singer K. J. Yesudas. Kaalam Parakkanu, the second song composed by Raghavan Master, which has Pramods lyrics, has been sung by Raghavan Masters disciple V. T. Murali. P. Bhaskarans poem Ente Thoolika has been adapted for a song composed on the lines of Rabindra Sangeet. It is the title song and has a mix of Urdu lyrics and Baul music too. It has been sung by Shahabaz Aman. The entire song signifies a journey. The Urdu portion has been sung by Ustad Faiyaz Khan. Sreekumaran Thampis lyrics for the film has been sung by K. S. Chithra and Vijay Yesudas as a duet while O. N. V. Kurups poem Vaaghdatta Bhoomi has been translated into Bengali and sung by Bengali singer Raghav Chatterjee. Kavalam Narayana Panikkar has composed a song in the folk music tradition that makes use of Basheers idioms and words. It has been sung by Shahabaz. Mammootty officially launched the music on 6 January 2014 by handing over the CD to late music director Raghavan Masters family. The soundtrack consists of six songs and four karaoke versions.

Built in 1935 by a Works Progress Administration crew, this large gymnasium was the only surviving remnant of a major push in the 1920s and 1930s to improve the education of African Americans in Oak Grove. It was a single-story wood-frame structure with a gable roof, with a shed-roofed vestibule area on the main southern facade.

    "text": "The Church of St James in Winscombe, Somerset, England, has 12th- or 13th-century origins but the present building dates from the 15th century. It is a Grade I listed building. There are no records remaining of the Norman church on the site, though the font and a single lancet window date from the period, and a Deed of Gift survives confirming that the church was consecrated by Bishop Jocelin on 26 August 1236. It was given by him to the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral three years later. The four-stage 100-foot 30.5 m tower one of the most elegant in Somerset was added around 1435, by Bishop John Harewell, and at the same time stained glass was added. The church was restored and a new chancel added in 1863. The rebuilding of the chancel was undertaken by William Burges. He was commissioned by the Reverend John Augustus Yatman, whose brother had been Burgess main client for painted furniture. Burges and his team, including Fred Weekes and Gualbert Saunders, also undertook the design of three stained-glass lancet windows in the chancel, in memory of Yatmans mother. Pevsner appreciated their quality, much better aesthetically is the glass in the chancel, but erroneously attributes them as one of the best examples of Morris glass in existence and quite unrecorded. The Carsleigh Window in the north wall of the chancel c. 1520 is decorated with silver stain, marking the close of the Middle Ages and the arrival of the Renaissance. There is medieval glass in the two windows in the north wall of the side chapel, and in the window next to the organ. The bells of St James have long called people to worship, the original bells being cast in 1773 by local founders the Bilbie family. Two newer bells were added in 1903 by Taylors Founders. The eight bells are in the key of E flat and the tenor weighs 1818 18 hundredweight, 1 quarter of a hundredweight and 8 lb, or 930 kg. St James holds regular services on Sundays, with bell ringing being provided for both the morning service and evensong.

    "text": "Wakatsuki 若月 was an Akizuki-class destroyer of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Her name means Young Moon. Wakatsuki played a minor role in the battle of the Empress Augusta Bay against a US cruiser-destroyer group, before surviving the bombing of Rabaul. After a series of escorting and transport missions, she escorted aircraft carriers at the disastrous battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, before being sunk by carrier aircraft at the battle of Ormoc Bay. Ironically, Wakatsuki is probably the most heavily photographed of any Akizuki class destroyer, despite there not being a single existing photo of the ship taken by her Japanese owners, simply due to the sheer amount of aerial photos taken of the ship by US warplanes during the bombing of Rabaul and battles of Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, and Ormoc Bay.  Design and description  The Akizuki-class ships were originally designed as anti-aircraft escorts for carrier battle groups, but were modified with torpedo tubes and depth charges to meet the need for more general-purpose destroyers. The ships measured 134.2 meters 440 ft 3 in overall, with beams of 11.6 meters 38 ft 1 in and drafts of 4.15 meters 13 ft 7 in. They displaced 2,701 long tons 2,744 t at standard load and 3,420 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. Their crews numbered 300 officers and enlisted men. Each ship had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of 52,000 shaft horsepower 38,776 kW for a designed speed of 33 knots 61 kmh; 38 mph. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them ranges of 8,300 nautical miles 15,400 km; 9,600 mi at speeds of 18 knots 33 kmh; 21 mph. The main armament of the Akizuki class consisted of eight 100-millimeter 3.9 in Type 98 dual-purpose guns in four twin-gun turrets, two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure. They each carried a dozen 25-millimeter 1 in Type 96 anti-aircraft AA guns in four triple-gun mounts. The ships were also each armed with four 610-millimeter 24 in torpedo tubes in a single quadruple rotating mount amidships; one reload was carried for each tube. The first batch of ships were each equipped with two depth charge throwers for which 54 depth charges were carried. Wakatsuki was equipped with a Type 21 early-warning radar on her foremast.  Construction and career  Wakatsuki was commissioned on 31 May 1943 into the 11th Destroyer Squadron for training. During these initial months, Wakatsuki operating alongside the destroyer Tamanami during their training duty of Hashirajima, including managing to tow the 40,000 ton battleship Nagato at a speed of 12 knots, and it was during this time period on the 8th of June that the battleship Mutsu suddenly and violently sank in harbor to a magazine detonation, prompting Wakatsuki and Tamanami to assist in rescuing 353 survivors. On 22 June, Wakatsuki departed Japan for the first time to escort the battleship Musashi which was carrying the remains of Admiral Yamamoto. She then escorted the troop transport Sagara Maru when she was crippled by a torpedo from the submarine USS Harder, requiring her to be towed to Japan. Underway, she was hit by another two torpedoes from the submarine USS Pompano, which finished her off as Wakatsuki abandoned her to sink. Shortly afterwards, Wakatsuki was reassigned to the 7th destroyer division with her sisterships Suzutsuki and Hatsuzuki, From 18-25 September, Wakatsuki escorted the combined fleet on a mission to counter US carrier raids, but no action occurred. A similar mission occurred from 17-26 October, and again they encountered no enemy forces, and from 30 October to 1 November she took part in a troop transport mission from Truk to Rabaul. Upon arriving, she was appointed as part of a task force with the goal of hunting attacking an allied cruiser force to replicate a battle of Savo Island style naval victory. This action occurred became the battle of the Empress Augusta Bay on 1-2 November. However, Wakatsuki contributed very little to the battle, unleashing several salvos of 3.9-inch 10 cm gunfire, but missing her shots, before avoiding a collision with the heavy cruiser Haguro. In turn, the light cruiser Sendai and the destroyer Hatsukaze were sunk, and several other ships were damaged, sending off the Japanese task force and ending the battle in a US victory. Later over the course of several days, Rabaul was attacked by hundreds of land based and carrier aircraft, during which Wakatsuki was attacked by several aircraft, and damaged by bomb near misses but not directly hit. She was however caught on video by US dive bombers, and was shown in a news reel of the bombing of Rabaul. The US mistook Wakatsuki for a cruiser and claimed to sink her. In actuality, the destroyer only suffered minor damage, and took part in several troop transport and escort missions, being present during the sinking",

The Scottish Championship was established in July 2013, after the Scottish Professional Football League was formed by a merger of the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League.  Format  Teams play each opponent four times in the season, twice at home and twice away from home. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned league champion. If points are equal, the goal difference determines the winner. If this still does not result in a winner, the tied teams must take part in a playoff game at a neutral venue to determine the final placings.  Promotion and relegation  The champions are directly promoted to the Scottish Premiership, swapping places with the bottom club of the Premiership. The clubs finishing 2nd, 3rd and 4th then enter the two-legged Premiership play-off. The 3rd-placed club plays the 4th-placed club, with the winner then playing the 2nd-placed club. The winner of that game then plays against the 11th-placed Premiership club. If the Championship play-off winner prevails, the club is promoted and the Premiership club is relegated; otherwise, the Premiership club remains in its league while the Championship club is not promoted. For promotion and relegation, the Championship play-off system closely mirrors its Premiership counterpartthe bottom-ranked club in the Championship is automatically relegated while the 9th-placed club undergoes a play-off with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed clubs from League One.

    "text": "Ctenophorus mckenziei, also commonly known as the dwarf-bicycle dragon and McKenzies dragon, is a species of endemic Australian lizard within the family Agamidae. Originally named and described as the agamid Amphibolurus mckenziei, the lizard had been identified within the regions of Western Australia and South Australia in which it occupied the shrubbery and woodland areas as its habitat. It was subsequently transferred to the genus Ctenophorus along with other agamid species with which it shared similar morphology and characteristics. The name mckenziei is in reference to Norman Leslie McKenzie, who was a zoologist and discovered the existence of the lizard. Listed on the IUCN red list page, threats to its population numbers are evaluated as least concern; however, its numbers are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and feral predators.  Etymology  Ctenophorus mckenziei was discovered first by Norman Leslie McKenzie. McKenzie worked for the Department of Conservation and Land Management, Western Australia, and was a zoologist for the Western Australian government as a Research Scientist 1970. The lizard was named after McKenzie who contributed to the research of Ctenophorus mckenziei, as he was a co-collector of the specimens and donor of much other material in the Western Australian Museum.  Description  The average total length of the dwarf-bicycle dragon is 6.5 cm 2.6 in, with a snout-to-vent length SVL of 31.576.5 mm 1.243.01 in, and a tail length approximately 230 of this length. It is perceived as having an alternating colour of black and brown on the top of its body, whilst progressively turning paler on the head and accompanied with a series of greyish-white spots, dashes and lines. These lines that appear, form narrow, paravertebral and dorso-lateral stripes from its head to the base of the tail, connected by a series of pale transverse bars. There are some pale upper lateral spots and a pale mid-lateral stripe that extends from the groin to the axilla and partially along the tail. Its underside characteristics include a white colouration, with a singular dark grey patch which is apparent on both the throat and the chest in males. This varies with the females which are densely stippled with a dark grey patch. Around its gular fold on the underside of its neck both males and females have dark ventral markings consisting of broad median stripes extending from its chin to gular fold. Adjacent to this, it has a rhomboidal shaped breast patch that can extend as far as to its groin on the underside of its belly. In similar nature to other species of Ctenophorus, its tympanum is visible, indicating it is able to hear. The canthus, or inner corner of its eye, is presented as angular. Its nostril is oval-shaped and faces outwards in a nasal scale that lies just below its canthal ridge. The lizards bodily stance has an adpressed hindlimb, that is adjacent to the ground. This limb when stretched reaches to around the eye or just beyond. The measurements of this hindlimb indicate it is about 85 of the snout-vent length.  Scalation  The lizard has dorsal body scalation, with the dorsal scales appearing small and sharply keeled. Similarly, accompanied with this, the scales that appear on the tail and legs are noticeably bigger and more sturdily keeled compared with its dorsal scales. It has a sequence of scales that are enlarged compared to dorsal scalation located on its neck, which are continuous with the vertebral series of enlarged scales that is present. On a skin-fold located on its neck, it has a cluster of smaller spinose scales. The scales that appear on the gular and ventral areas of the lizard are smooth.  Distribution  Ctenophorus mckenziei has been identified and collected from a limited number of locations that are distinguished within two minor regions in Western Australia and South Australia. Originally, during the 1984 Nullarbor survey in South Australia, it was first recorded at two separate sites that were 34 km 1.92.5 mi away from each other within the Yalata Indigenous Protected Area IPA. It was further recorded during the 1987 DEH Biological Survey in the Yellabinna Region at an equally small number of sites just a few kilometres to the east of the IPA. This total of six sites in which the lizard has been found within the IPA, attributed to two in 1984 and another for in 20072008, are all within 1012 kilometres 6.27.5 mi of each other, which justifies the rare status of the lizard. C. mckenziei has also been identified as living within a small area inland from Israelite Bay, Western Australia. Due to inaccessibility to the habitat of the lizard as a result of isolation from major population centres, it restricts visitation and research projects which limits the ability for study and knowledge of this species to expand, thus hypothesising a larger range of habitat within the SAWA region.  Habitat  Similar to other endemic",

    "text": "Przewalskis horse Equus ferus przewalskii or Equus przewalskii, also called the takhi, Mongolian wild horse or Dzungarian horse, is a rare and endangered wild horse originally native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky. Once extinct in the wild, since the 1990s it has been reintroduced to its native habitat in Mongolia in the Hustai National Park, Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, Khomiin Tal, and several other locales in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Several genetic characteristics of Przewalskis horse differ from those seen in modern domestic horses, indicating neither is an ancestor of the other. For example Przewalskis horse has 33 chromosome pairs compared with 32 for the domestic horse. Their ancestral lineages split from a common ancestor between 160,000 and 38,000 years ago, long before the domestication of the horse. Przewalskis horse was long considered the only remaining truly wild horse, in contrast with the American mustang and the Australian brumby, which are feral horses descended from domesticated animals. That status was called into question when domestic horses of the 5,000-year-old Botai culture of Central Asia were found to be more closely related to Przewalskis horses than to E. f. caballus. The study raised the possibility that modern Przewalskis horses could be the feral descendants of the domestic Botai horses. However, it remains possible that both the Botai horses and the modern Przewalskis horses descend separately from the same ancient wild Przewalskis horse population. Its taxonomic position is still debated, with some taxonomists treating Przewalskis horse as a species, E. przewalskii, others as a subspecies of wild horse E. ferus przewalskii or a variety of the domesticated horse E. ferus caballus. Przewalskis horse is stockily built, smaller, and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Typical height is about 1214 hands 4856 inches, 122142 cm, and the average weight is around 300 kg 660 lb. They have a dun coat with pangaré features and often have dark primitive markings.  Taxonomy  Przewalskis horse was formally described as a novel species in 1881 by Ivan Semyonovich Polyakov. The taxonomic position of Przewalskis horse remains controversial, and no consensus exists about whether it is a full species as Equus przewalskii; a subspecies of Equus ferus, the wild horse, as Equus ferus przewalskii in trinomial nomenclature, along with two other subspecies, the domestic horse E. f. caballus, and the extinct tarpan E. f. ferus; or even a subpopulation of the domesticated horse. The American Society of Mammalogists considers both Przewalskis horse and the tarpan to be subspecies of Equus ferus and classifies the domesticated horse as a separate species, Equus caballus.  Lineage  Genetic analysis shows that the takhi and the domesticated horse differ significantly, with neither ancestral to the other. The evolutionary divergence of the two populations was estimated to have occurred about 72,00038,000 years ago, well before domestication, most likely due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. According to a 2009 study, the earliest known domesticated horses were found at settlements of the Botai culture, from about 5500 years ago. These horses were raised for meat and milk. In 2018 a new study indicated ancient horses of the Botai culture are related to takhis, not to domesticated horses as was previously thought. Specifically, the Botai horses appeared to be ancestral to the modern takhi, because all seven takhis nested within the phylogenetic tree of the 20 Botai horses. No comparison was made to definitively wild early takhis. The authors posit that modern Przewalskis horses are feral descendants of the ancient Botai domesticated animals rather than representing a surviving population of never-domesticated horses. Another geneticist pointed out that Przewalskis horses may have simply descended from the same wild population that the Botai horses came from, which would still be compatible with the findings of the study. In 2021, William Taylor and Christina Barron-Ortiz disputed the evidence for domestication of Przewalskis horse. Their case was rejected by Alan Outram and colleagues in a paper which was not dated or peer-reviewed. Taylor reiterated his arguments that Przewalskis horse had never been domesticated in an article in Scientific American in 2024. In any case, the Botai horses were found to have negligible genetic contribution to any of the ancient or modern domestic horses studied, indicating that the domestication of the latter was independent, involving a different wild population, from any possible domestication of Przewalskis horse by the Botai culture.  Characteristics  Przewalskis horse is stockily built in comparison to domesticated horses, with shorter legs, and is much smaller and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Ty",

Moore ferried planes during the war and after the dissolution of WASP, lived as a homemaker. She received the Congressional Gold Medal for her service in 2010.  Biography  Moore was born in Rule, Texas and was raised in Haskell, Texas. Moore went to Haskell High School. Moores early flight instruction included learning to trust the airplane itself. She recalled that her flight instructor told her to take her hands and feet off the controls so that she could see that the plane would stay in the air on its own. One of her first flight passengers was her mother. Moore graduated from Southern Methodist University and attended Texas State College for Women. She began training in the Women Airforce Service Pilots WASP on November 1, 1943, at Avenger Field. Her parents, who supported her desire to serve, drove her to training. She graduated from her WASP training on May 23, 1944. Moore was stationed at Perrin Field. As a WASP, she ferried planes, some of which no longer had functioning instruments, forcing her to use dead reckoning. Many of the planes she flew were from Kelly Field, which was closing and she most often ferried BT-13s and AT-6s. She also tested planes after they were repaired. Moore married Captain Stanley L. Moore in 1945 and the couple settled in Sherman, Texas where Stanley was stationed. She went on to live as a homemaker and stay at home mother. In 2010, she was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for her service as a WASP.  References   References  Weigan, Cindy 2003. Texas Women in World War II. Lanham: Republic of Texas Press.

The album was released on October 21, 2011, in Ireland, on October 24, 2011, in the United Kingdom, and on October 25, 2011, in the United States. Receiving generally positive reviews from critics, Christmas is Bublés most successful album with more than 16 million copies worldwide as of January 2022, making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and one of the best-selling Christmas albums worldwide. On the week ending December 10, 2011, Christmas rose to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart, becoming Bublés third chart-topper following 2007s Call Me Irresponsible and 2009s Crazy Love, and spent five weeks at No. 1. Over the years, the album has reached number one in twenty international charts, including Australia, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom. The album also won a Juno Award for Album of the Year, making it the first holiday album to win the award. The album was re-released on November 26, 2012, containing four additional tracks, including a new recording of The Christmas Song. Bublé also released a reworked version of White Christmas, this time featuring Shania Twain, as a single. This version premiered on Bublés NBC television special, Home for the Holidays, on December 10, 2012.  Background  The album is Bublés second Christmas-themed release after he released a five-track extended play, titled Let It Snow in 2003. Some of the songs from Let It Snow have been re-recorded for inclusion on Christmas, making Christmas his first full-length holiday release. For the album, Bublé teamed up with several well-known artists to record duets. His duet version of White Christmas with country music singer Shania Twain was based on an early arrangement by The Drifters, while his recording of Jingle Bells with the Puppini Sisters was based on the 1943 recording of Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters. He also teamed up with Latin star Thalía for a recording of Feliz Navidad.

Mike Diver of BBC News, although he found the album a predictable programme, prised that Bublé does the classics to an accomplished standard and everything is professionally packaged and described the vocals smooth and steady, his lines wrap around these familiar pieces like fine ribbon around a promisingly shaped gift. Sal Cinquemani, on his list of The 21 Best Christmas Albums of the 21st Century for Billboard, ranked the album as",

    "text": "Chicken Tonight is a brand of sauce intended to be added to chicken pieces in a frying pan, available in flavors such as Honey  Mustard, Country French and Thai Green Curry.  History  Initially launched on October 23, 1990, under Unilevers Ragú brand in the United States and Canada, it was launched in the United Kingdom under the Knorr brand in 1993, while the same year, Chicken Tonight made its way to Oceania under the Raguletto brand. As of 2025, Chicken Tonight is a standalone brand. The associated advertising slogan is I feel like Chicken Tonight. In one series of television ads, these words were sung by actors as they flapped their arms in a movement similar to the dance The Chicken. An advertisement for Chicken Tonight was the first in the United Kingdom to use a red button interactive service to promote the product. The American version of the product was met with limited success; however, as of 2025, it is still sold in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Association football player Ian Wright appeared in advertisements for the product. In 2011, Unilever sold the Ragu business and the Chicken Tonight brand in a deal worth 30m in the United Kingdom to Symingtons, a food manufacturer in Leeds, who would drop the Knorr branding. Symingtons later acquired the Oceania rights to Raguletto and Chicken Tonight; they have since been acquired by Simplot. In 2019, Unilever also sold Chicken Tonight brand in the Netherlands to Zwanenberg Food Group.  In popular culture  The slogan was parodied in a skit on the Australian television series The Late Show in 1993 with Dickhead Tonight, where people danced while singing I Feel Like a Dickhead Tonight. The dance and song of the advertisement were parodied by The Simpsons family in the episode Lady Bouviers Lover. A segment on an Americas Funniest Home Videos episode parodied the brand as Iguana Tonight.  References   External links  Official website",

    "text": "Ford Model AA is a truck from Ford. As the Model T and TT became obsolete and needed to be replaced, Henry Ford began initial designs on the Model A and Model AA in 1926. Basic chassis layout was done rapidly and mechanical development was moved forward quickly. Body design and style was developed and then outsourced to various body manufacturers, including Briggs and Murray. The designs of the Model A shared parts and materials with the Model AA Ford, notably the body, engine and interior. The AA usually received plainer interiors than their car counterparts. The Model AA followed similar design changes to the Model A during the AAs four years in production, often delayed anywhere from three to nine months. The mechanical changes and upgrades were done during production of the vehicles. Body changes that occurred between 1929 and 1930 were also integrated into AA production, but leftover parts were used longer in the heavy commercial trucks.  Mechanical details  The Model AA Ford is powered by the same 201-cubic-inch 3.3 L I4 engine that the Model A Ford used. The engine produced a maximum of 40 horsepower at 2,200 rpm. The engine featured an up-draft carburetor, six-volt generator, 2 and 4-blade fan, mechanical water pump, mechanical oil pump, electric starter and four-row radiator. All of these features were identical to the Model A Ford except the radiator. The engine could also be crank started if necessary by a hand crank that is inserted through a hole in the radiator shell. The Model AA was based on a chassis that was similar in design to the Model A Ford, except it was substantially larger and heavier to accommodate the work this truck was designed for. The Model AA Ford has a four-speed manual gearbox. The additional gear in the transmission is a granny or creeper first gear with a higher reduction ratio than the first gear on a Model A Ford to provide more torque to move a loaded truck. The second through fourth gears on the Model AA transmission were similar ratios to the first through third gears on the Model A transmission. The Model AA transmission also featured a lock-out on the shift knob for reverse that required a lever to be activated with the thumb so reverse could be engaged. This was done to prevent accidental engagement of reverse while the truck was in motion. Early trucks had a worm gear rear-end that limited the top speed of the truck. That rear-end was replaced by a ring and pinion differential to improve the speed of the truck. The later differential came with high speed and low speed options. Later models were fitted with braces on the outer casing of the rear-end to provide additional support to the rear-end housing. The suspension of the AA Truck was similar to the Model A Ford in the front end. A leaf spring is centered in the front A frame over the front axle. Shock absorbers were available for the front end. The rear suspension differed from the Model A Ford. The AA had leaf springs mounted to the chassis and shackled to the rear axle. The rear suspension did not have shocks. The controls in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except the windshield wipers in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a pull lever system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the brake rods that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever on the floor with a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted in the middle of the steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the steering assembly. The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance and retard of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the idling speed of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine. The gauge cluster includes three basic gauges. The cluster is in a diamond formation, with the start key and pop-out locking switch is on the left point. The top of the cluste",

    "text": "The Scanlan Building is a building in Downtown Houston.  History  The building was first envisioned by Thomas Howe Scanlan, two-time mayor of Houston, to be built on the property he owned at Main and Preston streets. After his death in 1906, his seven daughters built the building as a memorial to him. Approximately 85 feet by 101 feet, the building was among the first in Houston to use a fireproof steel skeleton. The Scanlan Building, located at 405 Main Street in Houston, Texas, is an eleven-story, 76,403sq.ft building completed in 1909. Built on the site of the first official home of the president of the Republic of Texas, it was the first building of its size and type to be designed by a major national architect to be built in Houston, and set the style for future construction in the area. It is the only known office building in Houston which was designed by D.H. Burnham  Company of Chicago. The building was the first to be built higher than ten stories, breaking the limit preferred by Houston developer Jesse H. Jones. D. H. Burham  Company started work on the Scanlan Building just after the Columbian Exhibition of 1893. The steel-frame building was built in the Chicago style, with an L-shaped inner structure, permitting ventilation to the interior of the building. Facial details were restricted to the street sides of the building. Above the ground floor, all floors had an identical plan, with halls with offices on both sides, and one outer executive suite, including an interior office separated from the corridor by a receptionist office. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 23, 1980.  Current use  Workspace provider Novel Coworking purchased the Scanlan Building in June 2014 and renovated the buildings interior to provide private offices and co-working space for entrepreneurs and small businesses that need flexible, short-term workspace. As of February 2024, the owners, Level One, a subsidiary of Expansive a renaming of Novel, defaulted on its loan due in November 2023. The Scanlan Building was scheduled for foreclosure auction in March 2024.

    "text": "ReDOMption is the sixth episode of the fifth season of the American comedy-drama television series Entourage. It is the 60th overall episode of the series and was written by series creator Doug Ellin, and directed by Seith Mann. It originally aired on HBO on October 12, 2008. The series chronicles the acting career of Vincent Chase, a young A-list movie star, and his childhood friends from Queens, New York City, as they attempt to further their nascent careers in Los Angeles. In the episode, Dom returns and asks for Vinces help, but Eric distrusts him. Meanwhile, Turtle starts working as Dramas personal assistant, while Ari plays golf with Alan Gray to get a big role for Vince. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 1.61 million household viewers and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 1849. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the disjointed the storylines, particularly Doms subplot.  Plot  Hoping to get Vince Adrian Grenier in Smoke Jumpers, Ari Jeremy Piven decides to visit Alan Gray Paul Ben-Victor at a golf course to bet on the role. Ari is confident that Alans poor skills will be enough to win the bet, until he finds that Alans coach is Phil Mickelson, and that Alan invited Bob Ryan Martin Landau to insult Aris performance during the game. Vince is called by Dom Domenick Lombardozzi, who is on a car chase with LAPD officers on live TV. Dom is arrested and placed on jail, and he asks Vince to bail him out. Vince makes Eric Kevin Connolly pay the 100,000 bail, frustrating him. Believing that Dom is lying over his family and attempts at becoming a better person, Eric decides to watch over him through the day. He gets him to accompany them to a meeting where his client Charlie Bow Wow manages to land a pilot. Meanwhile, Turtle Jerry Ferrara desperately needs money, so he agrees to work as a personal assistant to Drama Kevin Dillon. However, Dramas complicated demands prove to be difficult for Turtle, who decides to get him an extra willing to have sex with him to make up for it, but Drama refuses. Eventually, Turtle decides to just quit. Ari loses the game, even when Alan gives him an easy final chance to score. Alan then begins insulting Ari for ruining his day by mentioning Vince, until he suddenly collapses from a heart attack. Vince and Eric visit Doms house, meeting his wife and child, both unaware of his arrest. They tell Dom to be honest with them, believing his wife will forgive him. Instead, his wife abandons him and Dom asks to go back to prison, feeling he has nothing left. At the apartment, the boys are called by Ari, who informs them that Alan died from the heart attack.  Production   Development  The episode was written by series creator Doug Ellin, and directed by Seith Mann. This was Ellins 38th writing credit, and Manns third directing credit.  Reception   Viewers  In its original American broadcast, ReDOMption was seen by an estimated 1.61 million household viewers with a 1.0 in the 1849 demographics. This means that 1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a slight increase in viewership with the previous episode, which was watched by an estimated 1.53 million household viewers with a 0.9 in the 1849 demographics.  Critical reviews  ReDOMption received mixed reviews from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode a good 7.5 out of 10 and wrote, Overall, this was a very decent episode, and it served the purpose of slightly advancing the overall storyline, but on its own, it doesnt stand up so well. It felt like a series of separate stories randomly put together, all of which were neither overly funny, nor were they memorably dramatic. One of the main problems was Dom, who despite all of his sorrows and bad luck, is a character thats too hard to like. Even with his losses at the end of the episode, its hard to feel any sympathy for him. The twist with Alan Gray was well played however, but it happened at the very end of the episode, so by the time the implications of his death started to settle in, the show was over. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B grade and wrote, While a lot of the shows comedic premise has gotten pretty tiredAri is angry, Drama is dumb, Turtle is highplot-wise, I think the show is more interesting than its been since the days of Aquaman. Alan Sepinwall wrote, I actually have very little to say about tonights Entourage, save that the ending of Aris story feels like its going to be a particularly skeevy way for the show to travel its usual everything works out just fine for Vince route. Kristal Hawkins of Vulture wrote, A sobered Ari calls the boys to let them know what happened and announces hes going home to his family because life is short. Next week, we assume  and will only assume, not actually try to find out  everything will return",

    "text": "Gladys Penny Thompson October 17, 1917  September 22, 1975 was an American aviator and womens intercontinental air race-air show promoter and aviation publisher-editor during the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1953, she married Miami Herald humor columnist Larry Thompson, and for 20 years until his death, she was featured often in his daily column, Life With Larry Thompson and in three books he authored. She founded the Miami-Dade Mothers of Twins Club and the Twins Easter Parade.  Early years  Born Gladys Rhodes, Penny Thompson watched planes fly over her familys farm in Sylvania, Georgia, as a young girl. This, along with her admiration for famed aviator Amelia Earhart, inspired her to fly. After getting her private pilots license in 1936, she moved to Miami, Florida, where the aviation industry was burgeoning. She published and edited an aviation newspaper, Southeastern Aviation News from 1945-1950.  Civil Air Patrol  During World War II, she joined the Civil Air Patrol as a volunteer and flew over the Gulf of Mexico searching for German submarines that were attacking Allied merchant ships. Her plane was destroyed in a fire on September 15, 1945, along with several hundred U.S. Navy aircraft and civilian planes battened down in giant wooden hangars at the Naval Air Station Richmond south of Miami in preparation for a major hurricane. Today, the Larry and Penny Thompson Memorial Park is located on the same property that originally encompassed the Naval Air Station.  Ninety-Nines  In 1946 she won the Bertram Trophy Race sponsored by the Ninety-Nines, the womens pilot organization started by Earhart, at the Florida Air Pilots Association Meet in Orlando, Florida. That same year Penny was elected vice chairman of the Florida chapter of the Ninety-Nines and chairman in 1947. Later in 1947, she led the drive to name the Miami Municipal Airport the Amelia Earhart Field, to honor the aviator who began her around-the-world flight from that field in 1937, disappearing over the Pacific Ocean.  Worlds First All-Woman Air Show  Following World War II, the annual All-American Air Maneuvers aviation event resumed in 1946 at Coast Guard Air Station Miami. The next year, women fliers were told they couldnt participate; so the women of the Florida Ninety-Nines organized their own air show at Tampa, Floridas Peter O. Knight Airport. Penny was selected as the general chairman of the worlds first All-Woman Air Show, held March 1516, 1947. It included a transcontinental air race from Palm Springs, California to Tampa. Proceeds were used to help young women obtain advanced aviation training through the Amelia Earhart Scholarship Fund. The event raised awareness of women in aviation and prompted air derbies and air marking parties throughout the U.S. The tradition of annual womens air races was begun. Penny played a role during this period in helping to elevate women in the male-dominated world of aviation and getting women fliers back into the mens All-American Air Maneuvers the next year, in large part due to the success of the 1947 All-Woman Air Show. In 1948, Penny also helped organize and promote the 2nd Annual All-Woman Air Show held June 46 at the Amelia Earhart Field in Miami, along with another transcontinental air race for female pilots, again raising money for the womens scholarship fund. The festivities culminated with the women fliers taking off from Key West, Florida for Havana, Cuba, 90 miles away, to continue their public relations efforts of promoting women in aviation.  Flying car  In 1949 Penny and Ellen Gilmore flew an experimental flying car called the Roadable Ercoupe, as part of the Montreal-Miami All-Womans Air Race, which culminated with the 3rd Annual All-Woman Air Show of the World in West Palm Beach, Florida. Landing in Jacksonville, Florida, they folded up the wings at sunset and drove on A1A the rest of the way to Daytona Beach, Florida, at night, then flew the rest of the way to Miami after daybreak. While they didnt win any prizes because the rules stated flying had to be during the day, their goal of obtaining national publicity for women pilots in general and the womens air show in particular, was successful., Their trip was featured in the nationally syndicated Smilin Jack aviation comic strip by Zack Mosley with Miss Penny-Ellen drawn on the comic stripss flying car. As a sign of the times, the character Smilin Jack said, This generation of girls has migrated from the kitchen to the cockpit! as he watched Penny and Ellen take off in their flying car.  Life with Larry Thompson  Several years later, Penny was interviewed by humorist Larry Thompson and reporter for the Miami Herald, who was doing a story on women in aviation. On February 13, 1953 they married. About that time, he was promoted to writing a daily humor column for the Herald and for the next 20 years until his death in 1973, Penny was thrust into the public spotl",

    "text": "Christophe Thivrier 16 May 1841  8 August 1895 was a French politician of working class origins who was the first Socialist mayor in France, and deputy of Allier from 1889 to 1895. At this time the industrialists of France were using dismissals and other forms of repression in an attempt to stamp out socialism, and workers were responding with strikes. Thivrier was uncompromising in his socialist principles, and was known as the deputé en blouse for wearing his blue workers smock in the Assembly to the outrage of the bourgeois members.  Early years 184174  Christophe Thivrier or Tivrier, known as Christou was born on 16 May 1841 in Durdat-Larequille, Allier, the youngest of four children. His parents were Jean Gilbert Thivrier 18091904 and Marie Anne Mansier 17991852. His father was from Néris-les-Bains, and worked as a farm laborer, in construction and in the mines. Christophe had to leave school and start work at an early age. He became a miner. When he was 28 he became a small building contractor, and later became a wine merchant. He was one of the founders of the labour movement in Allier. The Marianne, a secret society created to fight the reactionary actions of conservatives, often met in his home. On 15 November 1868 he married in Durdat-Larequille to Marie Martin 18421932. Their children were Gilbert Alphonse 1869-1936, Léon Martial 1871-1920, Joseph Isidore 1874-1944 and Louise Angéline 1879-1973.  Local politics 187489  In 1874 Thivrier was elected municipal councilor for Commentry on the Republican list. He was reelected in 1878. In 1879 he became a supporter of collectivism, and on 21 January 1881 he was elected to the council with the entire list of workers and socialists. It was the first town hall in France to be captured by the workers party and the socialists. Thivrier defeated Stéphane Mony, the director of the Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville, which owned the local mines, and a former mayor and deputy. A list was prepared of everyone who had spread socialist propaganda during the elections, including 135 miners. On 4 June 1881 they were all dismissed, and the workers went on strike. Another 300 were added to the list of agitators during the strike, and had to pass interviews to get their jobs back after the strike. 60 failed these interviews, and 67 were told they needed certificates of good conduct from their new employers before they could work again at the mines. Miners who had been elected to the local council could not find work and had to leave the district. Despite this repression, Thivrier was Mayor of Commentry from 4 June 1882, then district councilor, and gained huge support from the working class. Harassment by the prefectural administration against the workers administration and government persecution prevented the Socialist Party from presenting a list in the elections on 1884, but on 6 May 1888 Thivrier was reelected in triumph and again appointed Mayor of Commentry. He was removed from office on 14 December 1888 for having sent an address of sympathy to the trade union congress in Bordeaux that he signed with his title of mayor. Thivriers popularity grew, and in 1889 he was elected to the General Council of Allier.  Deputy 188995  Thivrier was elected deputy of Allier on 6 October 1889. In his election manifesto he denounced the oppression and misery of the workers, and proposed social measures such as social support for the old and disabled, responsibility of company owners for workplace accidents, and a direct tax on wealth and income. At the request of the Commentry Socialists he continued to wear his blue workers blouse smock in the Chamber as a symbol of the protest of the proletariat against the privileges of the capitalists, and a symbol of their hope of emancipation. He had campaigned as a Boulangist, but joined the Workers Party POF after being elected. Friedrich Engels saw the elections as a success, counting Eugène Baudin, Thivrier and Félix Lachizefr as Marxists, and considering that Gustave Paul Cluseret and Ernest Ferroul were bound to cast in their lot with the first three. However, Baudin, Lachize and Cluseret were never active in the POF, and Thivrier and Ferroul joined the POF after the election. In 1890 a strike broke out in Commentry due to the dismissal of 300 miners chosen from the most active socialists. Thivrier spoke out against the interventions and provocations of the army and gendarmerie in support of the mining company. Thivrier was a delegate of the French Workers Party at the Congress of Lille and Calais 1890 and at the International Congress of Brussels. He was soon criticized by his party for his sympathy with the Blanquist Central Revolutionary Committee CRC. His relationship with Jean Dormoyfr and the Montluçon socialists became strained. At the 1892 National Guesdist Congress in Marseille Thivrier raised violent controversy by defending the general",

It was founded in 1972 as The Clocktower Gallery by Alanna Heiss, the Founder and former Director of MoMA PS1 formerly P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center under the aegis of the Institute for Art and Urban Resources. From 1972 until 2013, the institution operated out of a building at 346 Broadway, between Catherine Lane and Leonard Street, owned by the New York City government in Tribeca, Manhattan. In 2013, the City of New York sold 346 Broadway to a private developer, and the organization relocated its operations through program partnerships with other arts institutions around the city, including Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Brooklyn, Knockdown Center in Queens, and Times Square Arts, among others.  History  Clocktower Productions is the organization formerly known as The Clocktower Gallery and ARTonAIR.org. Opening in 1972 with inaugural shows.

    "text": "The Mormon blogosphere often referred to as the Bloggernacle is a segment of the blogosphere focused on issues related to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints LDS Church. The term Bloggernacle was coined by individuals within the Latter-day Saint blogging community as a play on the name of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir; however, not all Latter-day Saint-themed bloggers like or use the name Bloggernacle, or even consider their blog to be part of it. Furthermore, not all bloggers within the Mormon blogosphere are Latter-day Saints themselves.  History  On November 23, 2002, the Mormon blogging community became a distinct entity with the founding of the blog Metaphysical Elders. Some component blogs from the Mormon blogospheres first two years were short lived, however one of its first bloggers, Dave Banack, began his longstanding Mormon Inquiry blog on August 19, 2003. On January 1, 2003, a multi-author blog Mormon Momma launched  a spin-off from the original Circle of Sisters column from Meridian Magazine. By the next two years, many multi-author blogs were launched, including Times and Seasons, By Common Consent, Feminist Mormon Housewives, and Millennial Star. On March 23, 2004, due to an article in The Revealer, the writer Kaimi Wenger at the LDS blog Times and Seasons noticed that the Jewish and Catholic blogging communities had adopted names for themselves. In a blog post titled The Nameless Mormon Blogosphere, Wenger sought to remedy this situation and asked for suggestions for a name. Christopher Bradford posting under the name Grasshopper suggested Bloggernacle Choir, the shortened version of which gained wide approval. Bloggernacle is a term that has been used commonly by LDS bloggers. The Latter-day Saint apologetic organization FairMormon features a website and blog; Jeff Lindsay began a Latter-day Saint apologetic blog entitled Mormanity in 2004. A Mormon litblog named A Motley Vision was founded in 2004 by William Morris. During 2005, several LDS-themed podcasts entered the Bloggernacle to augment Latter-day Saint blogging with audio programming; these included podcasts produced by church affiliated sources and an independent series, Mormon Stories Podcast, produced by John Dehlin who also founded the blog Stay LDS and the group blog Mormon Matters. Stay-at-home mothers who are LDS and who blog are known to comment occasionally upon their religion; two such writers whose blogs have become popular with non-Mormon audiences are Stephanie Nielson, of the blog the NieNie Dialogues, C. Jane Kendrick of CJane Enjoy It, and Jana Mathews who blogs at Momlogic as The Meanest Mom. A spoof on this genre of blog is the blog Seriously, so Blessed!, written by an anonymous Utah woman. In 2009, the religious news site Religion Dispatches ran a story about the phenomenon of Mormon mommy blogging, which its author believed arose in part in response to Elder M. Russell Ballards 2007 commencement address at Brigham Young UniversityHawaii, which had lauded efforts by Mormon faithful to share their beliefs through such means as blogging, citing an online post by Bookslinger pseudonymous author of the blog Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon. Mormon videographer Seth Adam Smith began blogging in 2004. Some of the Bloggernacles more prominent blogs are named after defunct Latter-day Saint publications. For example, Messenger and Advocate, a blog written by Guy Murray, was named after the LDS publication of the same name published 18341837 in Kirtland, Ohio. Keepapitchinin, a Mormon history blog written by Salt Lake Tribune columnist and independent historian Ardis Parshall that she founded in 2008, was named after a sporadically published humorous newspaper published 18671871 and pseudonymously written by three sons of LDS apostles, George J. Taylor, Joseph C. Rich, and Heber John Richards. Parshalls blog has won several Bloggernacle awards. Additionally, one of Parshalls Keepapitchinin posts received an Association for Mormon Letters award 2010. The blog Millennial Star was named after The Latter-day Saints Millennial Star, published in England 18401970; and the LDS history blog The Juvenile Instructor is the namesake of a publication intended as a catechism of Mormonism printed in Salt Lake City, Utah 18661930. Salt Lake City, Utahs The Deseret News began producing a separate, LDS-themed newspaper insert on January 10, 2008 named Mormon Times. The website version of this insert features readers feedback. The Mormon Times reporter covering the Bloggernacle is Emily W. Jensen. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints own internet presence is substantial, and former Church spokesman Michael Ottersons blogging contributions featured prominently in the LDS blogosphere as well. Linescratchers, an LDS contemporary music scene blog, also debuted in 2008. Neylan McBaine founded The Mormon Women Project in 2010. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latte",

In 1865 he was appointed professor at the Maximilians Gymnasium and received the Great Golden Medal from Maximilian II of Bavaria, for his chronological studies of the zodiac circle of Dendera and Manetho. From this recognition he was able to gain access to the collections at the court and library of king Ludwig I of Bavaria and study the royal collection of Egyptian artifacts held within. He later studied similar collections in Vienna, Trieste, Rome, Florence, Paris, London and Leiden focusing especially on the papyri. He made major contributions to the newly founded Journal of Egyptian Language and Antiquities. In 1869 he was appointed Honorary Professor of Egyptology, at Munich University and curator of the Egyptian collections. Some time later he began to be heavily criticized for the style of his writings. In the winter of 187273 he toured Egypt Cairo, Alexandria and Luxor which led to him publish some Travel letters, about his experiences there.

    "text": "Kilkenny is a township in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. It lies entirely within the White Mountain National Forest. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of zero. In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships which are different from towns, and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government if any, as many are uninhabited.  History  The town was granted to Jonathan Warner and others on June 4, 1774, containing 26,911 acres 108.90 km2. In 1840 it contained 19 inhabitants, and in 1856 it had 19 inhabitants and an area of 15,906 acres 64.37 km2, with a value of 20,000. It was named after the town and county of Kilkenny in Ireland. Kilkenny once included a large portion of what is now the eastern edge of Jefferson, tapering south into the area of Jefferson Notch at the foot of Mount Mitten. This included much of the area known as Jefferson Highland on the Portland Road present-day U.S. Route 2. By the 1870s, maps were showing the southern edge of Kilkenny as a line extending the border between Jefferson and Lancaster. The 1896 topographic map, however, shows that the boundary had again been adjusted several miles south, to include Mount Waumbek and Pliny Mountain, uninhabited areas. Deeds in this area often refer to the Kilkenny Addition. On the 1935 topographic map, the Upper Ammonoosuc Trail crossed Kilkenny along Priscilla Brook and through the pass from the Keenan Brook area of Randolph, north of Pliny Mountain. This trail has since been abandoned, although a 2002 atlas of New Hampshire shows a Priscilla Brook Trail in the same location. The Willard Bowl north of Mount Waumbek, drained by Garland Brook, was considered as a site for development of a ski area in 1971, when it was owned by former governor Hugh Gregg. On the 1896 topographic map, there was a BM railroad spur up much of Garland Brook, to an elevation of 2,100 feet 640 m. By 1935, the tracks were gone.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 25.7 square miles 66.6 km2, of which 0.02 square miles 0.05 km2, or 0.08, are water. Kilkenny is home to Mount Waumbek of the Pliny Range and Mount Cabot of the Pilot Range, each over 4,000 feet 1,200 m high see Four-thousand footers, as well as several other peaks over 3,000 feet 910 m. The summit of Mount Cabot is the highest point in Kilkenny, at 4,160 feet 1,270 m above sea level. The township is entirely within the Connecticut River watershed. The southern end of the township, as well as the west side of the Pilot Range, drain west via Fox Brook, Bunnell Brook, Garland Brook, and Priscilla Brook to the Israel River, which joins the Connecticut at Lancaster, while the northern end of the township, including the east side of the Pilot Range and its north end, drain to the Upper Ammonoosuc River, which flows north and west to join the Connecticut at Groveton.  Adjacent municipalities  Stark north Milan northeast Berlin east Randolph southeast Jefferson south Lancaster west  Climate   Demographics  As of the 2020 census, there were no people living in the township.

At the AIR Awards of 2025, the album was nominated for Best Independent Dance or Electronica Album or EP.  Background  The album title was announced alongside the release of AEIOU.  Critical reception  Jack Tregoning from The Guardian said Whats immediately obvious about Hyperbolic is that its prefabbed for the Spotify age, with six of its ten songs previously released, leaving just four for fans to discover anew. Its not so much an album with a deeply considered build, but rather a neat container for playlistable songs. Tregoning also said Pnau just wants to feel good all the time  subtlety be damned. Cyclone Wehner from The Music said Pnaus sixth album, Hyperbolic, diverges from Changa. Its pop, rather than festival-orientated, but its still about communal celebration. Wehner said Pnau are the Australian answer to Daft Punk. Chris Lamaro from AAA Backstage said Hyperbolic is a testament to Pnaus evolution, traversing from their roots in underground raves to the realms of disco-infused pop anthems, yet always anchored by their signature dancefloor essence, solidifying their position as electronic music maestros.

    "text": "HareClark is a type of single transferable vote electoral system of proportional representation used for elections in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. With its use in 1909, it was one of the first uses of the Gregory method for transfers of winners surplus votes. The name is derived from the names of English barrister Thomas Hare, the original inventor of single transferable voting, and Attorney-General of Tasmania Andrew Inglis Clark, who introduced a modified form to Tasmania in 1896.  History  Thomas Hare 18061891 is generally credited with the conception of the single transferable vote, while Andrew Inglis Clark 18481907 introduced the system to Tasmania with a modified counting method. The specific modification introduced by Mr. A.I. Clark, Attorney-General for Tasmania, is the provision devised by him for eliminating the element of chance in the selection and distribution of quota-excesses or surplus transfer votes. The provision described as Clarks own was the Gregory method later also adopted for the 1925 election of the Irish Senate, to transfer all votes to next order of preference the next usable marked preference, rather than a random sample. In 1896, after several failed attempts, Clark succeeded in having a system of proportional representation adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament. It was accepted only on a trial basis in the two main cities, Hobart to elect 6 MPs and Launceston to elect 4 MPs. This first Hare-Clark system, as it was immediately known, was renewed annually until suspended in 1902. Clark, never in robust health, died at his home Rosebank in Battery Point on 14 November 1907, just as the adoption of permanent proportional representation struggled through Parliament and over a year before it was used for the first time throughout Tasmania in the 1909 Tasmanian state election. Districts were used not state-wide districting, and district magnitude was five in each district - each district elected five members. Hare-Clark has been used continuously for Tasmanian state elections since 1909 for the House of Assembly. Tasmanias Legislative Council is elected by Instant-runoff voting, the same system as is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives. In the 1901 Australian federal election, the Hare-Clark system was used to elect 5 members for the Division of Tasmania, as the Federal voting rules were determined by the State. The Hare-Clark System was implemented to elect the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in the 1920 elections. However Jack Lang changed the electoral system back to first past the post in single member electorates prior to the 1927 state election. The Hare-Clark System has been used to elect the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly since 1992.  Evolution  Features of Hare-Clark have evolved over time. Until 1942, candidates were listed in alphabetic order rather than grouped together by party. Robson Rotation, where the order candidates appeared on ballot papers is randomised, was introduced in 1980. This had the effect of reducing any advantage a candidate had by appearing at the top of a party list, so as to eliminate any influence of donkey votes. As well, district magnitude the number of seats used in districts has changed since 1896.  Counting  After a candidate reaches a quota and is elected, all of their ballot papers are redistributed to elect additional candidates based on the voters next preferences indicated on each ballot paper. The redistributed votes have a reduced transfer value, which is determined by the relationship of the number of surplus votes received by the previously elected candidate compared to the total votes he or she holds. In a round that starts with no candidate holding un-transferred surplus votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their preferences are transferred at full value to the next usable preference marked on each ballot. Ballot papers with non-transferable votes are set aside during this process. The process of conducting the vote count in Hare-Clark and Australian Senate style systems is largely similar, with only minor differences. Prior to the 2016 Australian federal election, group voting tickets were used for Senate elections. This allowed parties to determine the order in which preferences would be distributed to other candidates. This option for voters to have their preferences determined by group voting tickets is still in use in Victoria. In contrast, under Hare-Clark, preferences are always explicitly determined by individual voters, and there is no above the line voting option.  Counting method with example  1. Initial count Any invalid votes are excluded e.g. no boxes marked and then the first preferences from each ballot paper is tallied. They are allocated to marked candidate. Each candidates total is announced. 2. Determining the quota The total count of valid votes is",

History  The Lenin League was formed at the beginning of April 1928, its members initially around 6,000 were mostly former members of the Communist Party of Germany KPD who were excluded from the party after the ultra-left and the left wing were ousted by the leadership under Ernst Thälmann. Among them were several Left Communist members of the Reichstag and the Prussian Landtag and other prominent members of the party such as Ruth Fischer, Arkadi Maslow, Werner Scholem, Paul Schlecht, Hugo Urbahns and Guido Heym. The founding members expressed their solidarity with the positions of the United Opposition around Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev in the Soviet Union, and criticized various aspects of the policies of the Communist International and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union e.g. the Stalinist line of socialism in one country and the alliance with the Kuomintang in China as revisionist deviations. Before the 1928 German federal election, the organization experienced its first major split when, with the exception of Hugo Urbahns who led the Lenin League to its end, all of its prominent politicians left the organization because of the surrender of Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev to the majority positions in the USSR and the participation in the elections being seen as premature. The result of the 1928 election 0.26; 80,230 votes was therefore disappointing. The slow but steady process of disintegration soon became unstoppable, especially as the KPD violently attacked the Lenin League within the framework of the politics of the Third Period, where any non-Communist workers organization was labeled as fascist. Individual members like Fritz Schimanski joined the KPD, and others like Guido Heym joined the SPD, so the Lenin League shrank to around 1,000 members. The Lenin League remained important only in a few localities, in Dortmund, Neu-Isenburg, Brunsbüttelkoog, and some cities of Brandenburg such as Bernau and Rathenow, where it was represented in the local parliaments. In the Rhineland and Berlin, some of Karl Korschs supporters joined the organization after their own structures were formally dissolved. In 1930, however, the truly Trotskyist wing around Anton Grylewicz split after controversies over the question of the reformability of the KPD and the Comintern and the character of Soviet foreign policy, and formed under the name of Left Opposition of the KPD. Recognizing early on the danger for the workers movement of the growth of the National Socialist German Workers Party NSDAP, the Lenin League was involved in various attempts from 1930 onwards to build a united front of the SPD and KPD workers parties against fascism, which only succeeded in intensified cooperation with other small left-wing organizations such as the Communist Party of Germany Opposition KPO and Socialist Workers Party of Germany SAPD. After several bans on its press in 1932 the newspaper Volkswille, initially published daily in 1928, three times a week from 1928 to 1930, weekly from 1930 to 1932 and every two weeks until the final ban, and the theoretical organ, the Fahne des Kommunismus, every two weeks, the organization had to go underground after the Reichstag fire in 1933. Unlike other small left-wing organizations, however, the Lenin League failed to establish a functional foreign leadership a group of exiles led by Hugo Urbahns existed in Stockholm or centralized illegal structures. Regional Lenin League resistance groups were active in various regions such as Hamburg, Thuringia or the Ruhr area, often in cooperation with other leftist organizations. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, their traces were lost.  References   Bibliography  Marcel Bois: Im Kampf gegen Stalinismus und Faschismus.

    "text": "John Roach Straton surname rhymes with Dayton; April 6, 1875  October 29, 1929 was an American Fundamentalist Baptist pastor. Straton was the son of the Reverend Henry Dundas Douglas Straton and the former Julia Rebecca Carter of Virginia. He became a Christian when he was a teenager and heard the revival preaching of James Hawthorne.  Early life and education  Straton graduated from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia in 1898. He also attended Southern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1902 to 1903 as well as University of Chicago and the Boston School of Oratory.  Ministry  Straton was ordained in 1900 and spent most of his adult life as pastor of several churches in four major cities: Second Baptist in Chicago 19051908, Immanuel-Seventh Baptist in Baltimore 19081913, First Baptist in Norfolk, Virginia 19141917, and most notably of the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City 19181929, which was the first church to operate its own radio station.Tell It From Calvary is a radio show that the church still produces weekly; its heard on WMCA AM570. Straton was supportive of the work of Uldine Utley, an immensely popular 14-year-old child preacher in the 1920s, and invited her to preach at Calvary Church. Along with William Bell Riley of Minnesota, Dr. Straton was one of the foremost leaders of the anti-evolution campaign of the 1920s. For years Straton carried on a feud with the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, New York City because of its Hall of the Age of Man, which displayed the remains of fossilized men. Straton charged the museum with mis-spending the taxpayers money, and poisoning the minds of school children by false and bestial theories of evolution. From December 1923 to May 1924, Dr. Straton engaged in a series of debates with the Modernist minister Charles Francis Potter of the West Side Unitarian Church. Friendly enemies, Straton and Potter debated the following subjects: 1 Resolved, that the Bible is the infallible word of God; 2 Resolved, that the world and man came by creation of a living God and not by evolution; 3 Resolved, that the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus Christ is an essential Christian doctrine; 4 Resolved, that Jesus Christ is the Divine Son of God; and 5 Resolved, that Jesus Christ will return in bodily presence to this earth and establish the reign of universal peace and righteousness. Later Straton published a book, The Famous New York Fundamentalist-Modernist Debates, which contained only his own speeches and omitted those of Potter. On June 28, 1924, he offered the opening invocation on the fifth day of the 1924 Democratic National Convention. During the Scopes Trial when the judge was considering letting scientists testify for the defense, William Jennings Bryan wired Straton to come to Dayton, Tennessee, to be a rebuttal witness. However, the judge ruled against the defense and Straton never went to Tennessee. After the trial and Bryans death, Straton challenged defense attorneys Clarence Darrow and Dudley Field Malone to debate, but was rebuffed. During the 1928 presidential campaign, Straton, along with William Bell Riley and J. Frank Norris, rallied opposition to Al Smith, the Roman Catholic nominee of the Democratic Party. In keeping with his strong opposition to the liquor traffic, Straton was one of the first to label Smith the candidate of rum, Romanism and rebellion, a phrase used unsuccessfully in 1884 against Grover Cleveland in the race against James G. Blaine. Huey Pierce Long, Jr., the governor of Louisiana in 1928 and a Smith supporter, claimed that Straton was being paid 500 a night for speeches on behalf of the Republican candidate, Herbert Hoover. Long accused Straton of waging war against white supremacy in the American South. Long said that he respected all clergymen and denominations but not when political considerations entered therein. Stratons health was broken by his intense schedule during the campaign, and in April 1929 he suffered a slight paralytic stroke, which led to a nervous breakdown brought on by overwork in the fall and finally a fatal heart attack on October 29, 1929. Straton married the former Georgia Hillyer of Atlanta, Georgia, on November 2, 1903, and they had four sons: Rev. Hillyer Hawthorne Straton, John Charles Straton, Rev. Warren Badenock Straton, and George Douglas Straton.  References   External links  Works by or about John Roach Straton at the Internet Archive Sermons of Dr. John Roach Straton",

    "text": "The Kingdom of Serbia was one of the major parties in the two Balkan Wars 8 October 1912  18 July 1913, gaining land in both conflicts. It experienced significant territorial gains in the Central Balkans, nearly doubling its territory. During the First Balkan War, most of the Kosovo Vilayet was taken by Serbia, while parts of the region of Metohija were taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro, a close ally. Over the centuries, populations of ethnic Serbs and Albanians tended to shift following territorial handovers. As a result of the multi-ethnic composition of Kosovo, the new administration provoked a mixed response from the local population. The ethnic Albanian population did not welcome Serbian rule and many were forced to flee the country. Kosovo Vilayet was agreed to be incorporated into Serbia and northern Metohija was agreed to be incoperated into Montenegro at the Treaty of London in May 1913. Disagreements regarding the territory of Macedonia among the members of the Balkan League led to the Second Balkan War, during which Serbia, Greece, Romania, Montenegro, and the Ottomans fought against Bulgaria in 1913. The new borders were ratified at the Treaty of Bucharest the same year. Serbia gained control over the land that became known as Vardar Macedonia Present-day North Macedonia. In 1918, Serbia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.  Background  Serbian Chetnik Organization  Balkan League  Following Italys victory in the Italo-Turkish War 29 September 1911  18 October 1912, the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and expand their empire. With the initial support of Russian agents, a series of agreements were reached between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while the empire could enlist reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways at the time was unusable, so most reinforcement would have to come by ship through the Aegean Sea. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny the use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912. Montenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. While refusing to enter into any such deal with Greece, Bulgaria negotiated treaties with Serbia to partition the area of northern Macedonia. According to Bulgarian strategy, the agreement would restrict Serbias access to Macedonia while allowing Bulgaria to unilaterally capture as much as its troops could without regard to Greek interests. Bulgaria thought it could occupy the larger part of Aegean Macedonia and the important port city of Salonika before the Greeks could get there. This alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable for all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912 to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October 25 September O.S.. Following an ultimatum for the Ottoman Empire, the remaining alliance members entered the conflict on 17 October.  Order of battle in the First Balkan War   Battles  First Balkan War 19121913 Battle of Kumanovo Battle of Prilep Battle of Bitola Siege of Adrianople Siege of Scutari Second Balkan War Battle of Bregalnica Battle of Pirot Battle of Kalimanci Battle of Vidin  Fall of Adrianople and Serbo-Bulgarian friction  The failure of the Şarköy-Bulair operation and the deployment of the 2nd Serbian Army together with its much-needed heavy siege artillery sealed Adrianoples fate. On 11 March, after a two weeks bombardment that destroyed many fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. Under the command of General Nikola Ivanov, the Bulgarian 2nd Army with 106,425 men and two Serb divisions with 47,275 men conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties. The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Richard Hall notes that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the Turkish historians note that 28,500-man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured including the unspecified number of wounded. Bulgarian losses for the entire Adrianople campaign amounted to 7,682. This was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war, even though it is speculated that the",

    "text": "Envigado Fútbol Club Spanish pronunciation: embiˈɣaðo ˈfuðβol ˈkluβ is a Colombian professional football team based in Envigado, that currently plays in the Categoría Primera B. They play their home games at the Estadio Polideportivo Sur. The club is renowned for the quality of its youth development and the number of international stars who have begun their careers with the team including James Rodríguez, Fredy Guarín, Juan Fernando Quintero, Jhon Córdoba, Mateus Uribe, Giovanni Moreno, Jhon Duran among others. It is frequently considered one of the best youth academies in South America, which is why it is known as Cantera de Heroes Quarry of Heroes.  History  The club was founded on 14 October 1989 and became the first team to earn promotion to the Colombian top flight as they won the inaugural Categoría Primera B tournament, held in 1991. In that tournament, they topped the final group ahead of Alianza Llanos, Club El Cóndor, and Atlético Huila. Envigado were able to consolidate themselves as a Primera A team, reaching the final stages of the league for the first time in 1994 after placing eighth. They were eliminated in the semifinals, placing third in their group. They also made it to the final stages of the competition in the 2002 Apertura, in which they also placed third in their semifinal group, and the 2005 Apertura, in which they placed second in their group, one point behind the eventual finalists Santa Fe. Envigado were relegated from the Primera A on 12 November 2006 after a 10 loss to Cúcuta Deportivo on the final round of the 2006 Finalización tournament, thus ending a 15-year spell in the top flight, but quickly bounced back by winning the 2007 Primera B tournament with a team led by debutant playmakers James Rodríguez and Giovanni Moreno and managed by Jesús Barrios. Envigado secured promotion back to the top flight by beating Academia in the finals of both of the seasons short tournaments. The team was at risk of relegation in the following seasons, playing relegation play-offs in 2008 and 2010, but they defended successfully their Primera A status in both of them. They made their best campaign in the top flight in the 2011 season, when they made it to the quarter-finals of both the Apertura and Finalización tournaments, which helped them place third in the seasons aggregate table and achieve their first qualification for an international tournament, the 2012 Copa Sudamericana. There they were eliminated at the second stage after beating Unión Comercio from Peru 20 on aggregate and losing to Liverpool from Uruguay 21 on aggregate. In November 2014, Envigado F.C. and its major shareholder Juan Pablo Upegui were included into the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List also known as the Clinton List by the United Statess Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC due to their links with the drug cartel Oficina de Envigado Envigado Office. Although not all of the clubs transactions were found to be illicit, the U.S. Treasury verified that the club had been used by the organization for money laundering, after 10 years of investigations. Envigado was removed from the list on 26 April 2018, and shortly after it was announced that 55 of the clubs shares had been sold to the equity fund ProFútbol. In 2025, and following poor campaigns in the preceeding seasons, Envigado ended a 17-year spell in the top flight as they were relegated to the second tier for the second time in their history. Their relegation was confirmed with six matches left in the season after they lost 21 to Atlético Bucaramanga on 4 October.

    "text": "Camberwell station is a railway station operated by Metro Trains Melbourne on the Alamein, Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are part of the Melbourne rail network. It serves the eastern suburb of Camberwell, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Camberwell station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform connected by a ramp and accessible overground concourse. It opened on 3 April 1882, with the current station provided in 1919.  History  Camberwell station opened on 3 April 1882, when the railway line was extended from Hawthorn. It remained the terminus of the line for a few months in that year, until the railway was extended to Lilydale. When the first section of the Outer Circle line opened in 1891, a new station was built at East Camberwell, to provide an interchange. However, the Outer Circle line quickly failed. By 1898, only the section from East Camberwell to Ashburton remained in operation later extended to Alamein in 1948, and services for Ashburton began to depart from Camberwell. In the late 1910s, the line from Hawthorn to Camberwell was regraded, to ease the steep gradient facing down services. Steam locomotives could not pull a fully laden train between the two stations, so peak-hour services had to be split. The locomotive would bring one set of carriages to Camberwell, then return for the other set, causing significant delays. With the regrading, the tracks at Camberwell were sunk into a cutting and the existing station was demolished. In 1919, the current Federation-style station buildings were provided, when the works were completed. Immediately east of the station, the Alamein line diverges south, with a flyover carrying the southbound line over the Lilydale and Belgrave lines. This flyover was provided in 1959, when the line was duplicated to Riversdale. In 1963, a third line was provided between Hawthorn and Camberwell and, in 1964, the third line was extended to East Camberwell. Also occurring in November of that year, the signal box at Camberwell was the first in Victoria to have push-button signalling installed. In 1972, the centre track was extended to East Camberwell and, in 1974, the platforms were renumbered to their current arrangement. At around 7:20am on 9 August 1975, a Tait train set rolled away from the station prior to operating an Alamein service. It occurred after the driver and guard left the train and went into the station building. It reached speeds of up to 30kph before it slowed to walking speed near Flinders Street, allowing a drivers supervisor to jump aboard and stop the train. No passengers were onboard at the time. On 27 April 1996, Camberwell was upgraded to a premium station. In 1997, four stabling sidings were constructed on the site of the former goods yard, to replace sidings that were removed at Jolimont Yard, with the sidings brought into service on 5 January 1998. The stabling sidings had been first proposed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority The Met in the mid-1980s.  Redevelopment controversy  In 2001, the Victorian State Government launched a new metropolitan planning strategy, Melbourne 2030, which proposed intensification of development around public transport nodes, such as railway stations and tram routes, along with limits on such development in residential neighbourhoods. The precinct around the station was identified as one of a number of activity centres earmarked for redevelopment. In March 2003, VicTrack announced plans to develop the airspace over the site, including the construction of a deck over the station platforms and adjacent stabling yard, with 34 levels of car park, and 34 storeys of commercial space. The original plans, involving the stations demolition, led to protests from the local community. They received a significant amount of media attention, with actor Geoffrey Rush and comedian Barry Humphries publicly backing the campaign, and heading a protest march up Burke Road from Camberwell Junction to the station. The comedian performed a poem about planners at the rally, and noted that the railway line was sometimes called The Orient Express. To those supporting development of the station, the actions of the protesters were seen as an example of NIMBYism. The Boroondara Residents Action Group worked with architects McGauran Giannini Soon to provide alternative ideas for developing the air-space over the station and yard that were more in-keeping with their view of community preferences, including a small public plaza and a new public library, with some small-scale shops. Although the station is historic, it is not protected by any of the states heritage listings for any architectural or cultural reasons, and failed to gain that protection when nominated to the Victorian Heritage Register by local residents groups. In July 2009, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approved a nine-story development on the site, pr",

    "text": "The spectacled cormorant or Pallass cormorant Urile perspicillatus is an extinct marine bird of the cormorant family of seabirds that inhabited Bering Island and possibly other places in the Commander Islands and the nearby coast of Kamchatka in the far northeast of Russia. The modern distribution was shown to be a relict of a wider prehistoric distribution in 2018 when fossils of the species from 120,000 years ago were found in Japan. It is the largest species of cormorant known to have existed.  Taxonomy  It was formerly classified in the genus Phalacrocorax, but in 2021, the IOC reclassified it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus Urile, based on a 2014 study that supported reclassifying the Brandts, red-faced, and pelagic cormorants into that genus. Although the spectacled cormorant was not mentioned in the 2014 study and its current taxonomic position is unresolvable by the current phylogenies, it was also reclassified into Urile based on its perceived relatedness to those species.  Description  The species was first identified by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741 on Vitus Berings disastrous second Kamchatka expedition. He described the bird as large, clumsy and almost flightless  though it was probably reluctant to fly rather than physically unable  and wrote they weighed 1214 pounds, so that one single bird was sufficient for three starving men. Though cormorants are normally notoriously bad-tasting, Steller says that this bird tasted delicious, particularly when it was cooked in the way of the native Kamchadals, who encased the whole bird in clay, buried it, and baked it in a heated pit. With a body mass estimated to be from 3.5 to 6.8 kg 7.7 to 15.0 lb and a length up to around 100 cm 39 in, the spectacled cormorant was rather larger than all other known cormorants. In a similar fashion to the extant flightless cormorant, which may have rivaled it in length but not weight, the spectacled cormorant is thought to have at least largely lost the power of flight which is borne out by the reduced sternum and wing chord of museum specimens. This species was largely glossy black in color with a reported greenish gloss that may have been fairly vivid in bright light. A contrasting large white patch could be seen on its lower flanks just above the legs. Like other cormorants, they had small patches of bare skin about the face including a small gular patch and a small amount of bare skin around the eyes; these areas usually appeared to have been dull-yellow or grayish in hue, but during breeding stages, they may have changed to a bright orangey-reddish hue. During breeding stages, they also had a prominent crest on their head. The bare skin around the eyes, as well as the crest, were not present in females.  Extinction  Apart from the fact that it fed on fish, almost nothing else is known about the life history of this bird. The population declined quickly after further visitors to the area started collecting the birds for food and feathers. Their reports of profitable whaling grounds and large populations of Arctic foxes and other animals with valuable pelts led to a massive influx of whalers and fur traders into the region; the last birds were reported to have lived around 1850 on Kamen Ariy Russian: Камень Арий islet, off the northwestern tip of Bering Island. Only seven known specimens are currently preserved in public collections, with all specimens collected and given away by the same individual. None of these specimens are available on public display. A presumed prehistoric record from Amchitka Island, Alaska, is based on misidentification of double-crested cormorant remains.

    "text": "Holler is the second extended play by the South Korean girl group, Girls Generation-TTS. It was released digitally on September 16, 2014, and physically on September 18, 2014, by SM Entertainment.  Background and release  Holler debuted at number 1 on both Gaons weekly chart and Billboard World Albums chart. As a result, TTS became the third Korean artist and the first female one to have at least two albums at number 1 on the latter chart. The group previously achieved the number 1 spot two years back, with their debut release, Twinkle. They made their first comeback performance in a showcase at the Olympic Parks Woori Financial Art Hall in Seoul, performing various songs, including tracks from their previous album. During an interview with Billboard, the three singers expressed, This album was really personal for us and it was fun...to put out a much more raw side of our music...the music we put together has so much more layers, so much more depth to it in terms of sound, choruses or harmonizing together....Our main goal was to not be visually entertaining, but be vocally entertaining. They further described the album as an edgier, more mature version of its predecessor, Twinkle, and stated, We want to make feel good songs that are relatable, we want to make albums that are more natural...and speak from the bottom of our hearts. The trio revealed that Taeyeon took responsibility for the song selection, Seohyun penned the lyrics to the song, Only U, while Tiffany served as the visual director to the overall album image and the concept of Holler music video. The release of the album coincided with the broadcast of TTSs reality television show, The TaeTiSeo; thus, some footage of the album preparation was shown. The group performed various songs for their promotional activities, including Holler, Whisper, Only U, and Adrenaline. They achieved two Number 1 wins on Mnets M Countdown, one win on MBCs Music Core, one win on SBSs Inkigayo, and one win on KBSs Music Bank. The group made some radio and television appearances such as on MBCs Sunnys FM Date, or KBS2s You Hee-yeols Sketchbook, where they sang a rendition of Destinys Childs Cater 2 U.  Singles  The single track Whisper was released on September 13, peaking at number 4 on Gaons weekly chart. The title track, Holler peaked at number 3 on Gaons weekly chart and number 6 on Billboards World digital song chart. Tiffany described it as a rhythmical song that has a big brass sound that stands out with a funky groove, soul, and is overflowing with energy. Its music video became number 1 on YouTubes weekly Top 20 K-Pop Music Video Chart, and later the most viewed K-Pop video in America  around the world for September 2014. The song was initially given to Japanese singer Mizuki Watanabe under the title Hello Me!, which was a B-side of her 2007 single, Best Friend.

    "text": "Ubatuba is a Brazilian municipality, located on the northeast coast, in the state of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 92,819 2021 est. in an area of 723.88 km2, of which 83 is located in the Serra do Mar State Park. Ubatuba is one of fifteen municipalities in São Paulo that the state considers to be coastal resorts because they satisfy specific standards set by state legislation. This classification entitles these communities more money from the state for the development of regional tourism. In addition, the municipality gains the right to add the title of seaside resort to its name, a word used both in the official municipal file and in state references.  Toponymy  Its name is of Tupi origin, and it has at least two meanings. Ubá means canoe in Tupi, whereas uubá means river cane, which is a type of grass utilized by the indigenous people to make arrows. Because tyba means gathering, the citys name might refer to either gathering of river reeds or gathering of boats.  Geography  Ubatuba is linked with the Rodovia Longitudinal or the BR-101. It is located east of São Paulo and east-northeast of Santos and west of Rio de Janeiro. At latitude 232621.45, it is bounded to the north by Paraty Rio de Janeiro, to the south by Caraguatatuba, to the west by Cunha, São Luiz do Paraitinga, and Natividade da Serra, and to the east by the Atlantic Ocean. The city lies on the Tropic of Capricorn, which crosses just in front of the municipal airport runway. The urban area is mainly concentrated in the Atlantic and valley areas. The city frequently receives rain, hence the nickname Uba Chuva chuva being Portuguese for rain. Much of the land to the north is forested and mountainous, forming a part of the Serra do Mar mountains. Serra do Mar State Park was established in order to conserve and preserve the Atlantic Forest and covers 83 of the municipality, having a few connector roads through the mountain range and consisting of three centers within Ubatuba: Cunha-Indaiá, Santa Virgínia and Picinguaba. The municipality contains part of the Tupinambás Ecological Station, which protects some of the coastal islands. A marine park was created under Projeto TAMAR TAMAR Project to protect sea turtles. In addition, the Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo runs the Clarimundo de Jesus research base in Ubatuba.  Climate  Ubatuba has a tropical rainforest climate Köppen: Af. It rains during the entire year, more frequently during summer, with the rainfall about 2,520 millimetersyear. It has no dry season.  Tourism  Ubatuba is an important tourist city, receiving tourists from many parts of Brazil and served by Gastão Madeira Airport. Ubatuba features over 100 beaches. Among these are Maranduba, Lázaro, Itamambuca, Vermelha, Grande, Enseada, Perequê and Saco da Ribeira. Ubatuba also features an island named Anchieta after José de Anchieta. It has been a nature preserve since March 22, 1977. Ubatuba is considered, by law, as The Surf Capital of São Paulo State. The city has received this honour because more than ten important surf contests are held off its beaches every year, including two world qualifying series, two Super Surf Pro series, and other competitions supported by such well-established brands as Billabong, Quiksilver and Dunkelvolk which sponsored the 2009 edition of Ubatuba Surf Contest with more than 120 athletes. Lately, the city has also been known by its biodiversity, especially in relation to birds. There are more than 565 different bird species already identified within the city as of April 2012.  History  Ubatuba was the place where the Portuguese signed the first treaty of peace of the Americas with the Tupinambá native tribe The Yperoig Peace Treaty - Tratado de Paz de Iperoig, a treaty that kept Brazil in Portuguese hands, with only one language and one faith Catholicism. Back in the 16th century, the Tupinambá families were forced into slavery, working on sugar cane plantations along the Southern Shores surrounding the towns of São Vicente and Itanhaém, a region also called Morpion at that time according to André Thévet - Singularités de la France Antarctique. The Tupinambá responded to this outrage with the Tamoio Confederation, a powerful military alliance that stood to destroy São Vicente, with the help of the French, who had founded a Protestant refugee colony, France Antarctique in Guanabara Bay before the foundation of Rio de Janeiro. The Portuguese sent two Jesuit priests, Fathers Anchieta and Nobrega, to Ubatuba a tribe named Yperoig, to make peace with the Tupinambá Indians. Anchieta was kept as a hostage and Nobrega returned to Saint Vincent along with the Chief Cunhambebe to make arrangements for the final Treaty. The Portuguese won, destroying France Antarctique and keeping the land.  Population history in numbers   Media  In t",

    "text": "James Wood-Mason December 1846  6 May 1893 was an English zoologist. He was the director of the Indian Museum at Calcutta, after John Anderson. He collected marine animals and lepidoptera, but is best known for his work on two other groups of insects, phasmids stick insects and mantises praying mantises. The genus Woodmasonia Brunner, 1907, and at least ten species of phasmids, are named after him.  Life and career  Wood-Mason was born in Gloucestershire, England, where his father was a doctor. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Queens College, Oxford. He went out to India in 1869 to work in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, which in 2008 still housed his collection of insects. In 1872 he sailed to the Andaman Islands, mostly studying marine animals, but also collecting and later describing two new phasmids, Bacillus hispidulus and Bacillus westwoodii. Wood-Mason described 24 new species of phasmids, mostly from South Asia but also some from Australia, New Britain, Madagascar, the Malay peninsula and Fiji. His naming of Cotylosoma dipneusticum Wood-Mason, 1878 is particularly curious as he never formally described the species; it was wrongly imagined to be semi-aquatic; it was described with what is probably the least precise measurement ever used for a phasmid, namely between three and four inches in length; and he gave its locality as Borneo, when in fact it came from Fiji. In 1887 he became Superintendent of the Indian Museum. Also in 1887, he became vice-president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1888 he sailed on the Indian Marine Survey steamship HMS Investigator, working on and later describing new species of Crustacea, along with Alfred William Alcock, who recorded the voyage in his classic natural history book A Naturalist in Indian Seas 1902. For several years he suffered from Brights disease. On 5 April 1893, unable to work, he left India for England, but died at sea on 6 May 1893.  Flower mantis drawing  Wood-Mason gave his flower mantis drawing to Alfred Russel Wallace, who wrote in his 1889 book Darwinism: A beautiful drawing of this rare insect, Hymenopus bicornis in the nymph or active pupa state, was kindly sent me by Mr. Wood-Mason, Curator of the Indian Museum at Calcutta. A species, very similar to it, inhabits Java, where it is said to resemble a pink orchid. Other Mantidae, of the genus Gongylus, have the anterior part of the thorax dilated and coloured either white, pink, or purple; and they so closely resemble flowers that, according to Mr. Wood-Mason, one of them, having a bright violet-blue prothoracic shield, was found in Pegu by a botanist, and was for a moment mistaken by him for a flower. See Proc. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1878, p. liii. Wallace passed the drawing to Edward Bagnall Poulton, who published it in his 1890 book The Colours of Animals.  Honours  Wood-Mason was a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society. In 1888 he became a Fellow of the University of Calcutta. Over 10 marine animals have the specific name woodmasoni in his honour, including several described by Alcock of the Investigator : Heterocarpus woodmasoni, Coryphaenoides woodmasoni, Thalamita woodmasoni, and Rectopalicus woodmasoni. Two species of snake are named in his honour: Oligodon woodmasoni and Uropeltis woodmasoni.  Publications  Entomological Notes. 1.

    "text": "SNP Students also known as the Federation of Student Nationalists is the student wing of the Scottish National Party SNP, representing students in Scottish higher education. It was formed in 1961 when various student organisations supportive of Scottish independence and the SNP in particular decided to join forces into a new constituent body. Unlike Young Scots for Independence, which is the youth wing of the SNP, the group is for those in higher education and membership is not restricted by age. The organisation has branches at most of Scotlands universities, and regularly campaigns for independence and a host of other policies across the country.  History  The organisation was formed in 1961 and key figures were Neil MacCormick and Allan Macartney who would both later become SNP members of the European Parliament. By 1975 the group had around 1,500 members in Scotland. It has played an active part in the affairs of the SNP and is represented on the partys National Executive Committee, in the past with a representative position shared with the Young Scots for Independence, but now each organisation has its own representative. The SNP Students can send up to 15 delegates to the SNP Annual National Conference and 6 delegates to meetings of its National Council. In the 2000 SNP leadership election the organisation supported Alex Neil who lost to John Swinney. In all subsequent leadership campaigns the organisation did not officially endorse any candidate. It has informal links with Plaid Ifanc, the youth wing of Plaid Cymru. Until its September 2019 conference, it was also a part of the European Free Alliance Youth. As of November 2021, they had a membership of 5,800 people who were at colleges and universities across Scotland.  Activity  SNP Students has been very active in recent years, organising high-profile campaigns on issues such as Equal Marriage, zero-hour contracts and the stripping of charitable status from fee-paying schools. In September 2008, during a debate at the University of Edinburgh, a student member stated that the SNP Students executive was opposed to the proposals from the SNP-led Scottish Government to raise the minimum purchase age for alcohol in off-sales from 18 to 21. In 2012, during the SNPs policy change on NATO membership of an independent Scotland, SNP Students publicly came out in favour of retaining the anti-NATO policy, however at SNP conference the vote was lost despite SNP Students delegates voting against, and as a result the SNP is now pro-NATO. At the SNP Students conference in 2015, they voted in favour of reintroducing rent controls in Scotland. At the SNP Students conference in September 2019, SNP Students voted to disaffiliate from the European Free Alliance Youth, citing a fundamental disagreement with the ethos of the organisation and expressing the desire to build relationships with mainstream social democratic forces in Europe instead. In 2019, SNP Students successfully campaigned for an end to graduation fees in Scotland, passing a resolution at the October 2019 SNP Conference calling on all universities in Scotland to abolish graduation fees. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, SNP Students campaigned with others for the introduction of a Summer SAAS, and a No Detriment Policy at Scotlands universities. On 31 December 2020, the day the Brexit transition period ended, SNP Students published a co-authored statement with the Scottish Young Liberals, Scottish Labour Students, and the Scottish Young Greens, condemning the UK Government for Brexit and calling for Scotland to continue as a member of the Erasmus scheme. In the SNPs manifesto for the 2021 Holyrood Election, the SNP committed to abolishing all core curriculum charges, implementing an SNP Students policy, pushed for at the 2020 National Conference. This came into effect on the 14 July 2021. At its 2021 National Conference on 25 September 2021, SNP Students unanimously passed a motion calling for the extension of free bus travel to all students at colleges and universities in Scotland.  Organisation  The organisation is run by a National Executive Committee NEC elected each year at the SNP Students Annual Conference. The Committee currently comprises a Convener, Vice Convener, Secretary, Treasurer, Organiser, Equalities Officer and Communications Officer. Affiliated SNP and Yes societies with SNP Students: Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association Strathclyde University SNP Society Edinburgh University Yes Students for Independence St Andrews University Scottish Independence society The organisations main opponent among universities across Scotland is the democratic socialist Scottish Labour Students, which comprises nine university student organisations.

Surrounded by a 140-acre 57 ha campus, the Academys main building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. GBA is located in rural southeastern West Virginia. The Academy has been linked to multiple cases of child neglect, as well as the troubled teen industry. Greenbrier Academy announced plans to close on March 13, 2023.

The school also gives students the chance participate in service to the community and to go on service trips to Africa and Nicaragua.  Therapeutics  The school also offers a number of therapy programs, centered on a philosophy called Strong or Applied Relationality. This philosophy is not widely recognized and seems to be based on a book by the founder of the school, self-proclaimed guru and former lawyer L. Jay Mitchell see Controversy below. This philosophy claims that the primary cause of apparently any symptoms exhibited by adolescents is that her perceptions of past, present, and future relationsal experiences. According to the philosophy, Present perceptions of past experiences guide our behaviors and emotions and that through viewing things in the appropriate context, healing can happen. The philosophy appears to be similar to Social Cognitive Theory.

The school also offers continuing care through its Alumni network.  References   External links  Official website",

    "text": "Pencaitland is a village in East Lothian, Scotland, about 12 miles 19 kilometres south-east of Edinburgh, 5 mi 8 km south-west of Haddington, and 1 mi 2 km east of Ormiston. The land where the village lies is said to have been granted by William the Lion to Calum Cormack in 1169, who gave the church, with the tithes and other property belonging to it, to the monks of Kelso, in whose possession it remained till a short time prior to the accession of Robert Bruce. The land subsequently became the property of a younger branch of the Maxwell family, who granted the advowson and tithes to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey, who held them until the Reformation. The Tyne Water divides the village into Easter Pencaitland and Wester Pencaitland, crossed by a three-arched bridge dating from the 16th Century. An ancient cross in Wester Pencaitland indicates that a market was regularly held there. A large industrial maltings, which was built in 1965, is situated just before the entrance to the village at Wester Pencaitland.  Etymology  The name Pencaitland is first attested in 1296, as Penketland, Penkatlond and Penkatelen. It is thought derive either from the Brittonic language words corresponding to modern Welsh pen head, top, hill, coed wood, and llan clearing, enclosure, in which case it once meant head of a clearing or enclosure in or near a wood, or pen and coedlan copse, in which case it meant end of the copse.  Pencaitland Community Council  Pencaitland Community Council meets 10 times throughout the year, typically on the last Wednesday of the month at the Trevelyan Hall in Wester Pencaitland. The Community Council is constituted from fifteen members of the local population along with the locally elected representatives of the Faside catchment. This catchment extends to New Winton and Boggs Holdings to the north and Peastonbank to the south.  Winton Castle  12 mile 800 metres northwest of Pencaitland is Winton Castle, the original square Tower house being built in the 15th century on land granted to the Setons by David I c1152, and mentioned in a charter to them from William the Lion in 1169. It was burnt by the Earl of Hertfords forces during the Rough Wooing, and subsequently repaired, restored, and later enlarged by George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton, commencing in 1619. Architecturally, Winton is one of the most important houses in Scotland, due largely to the work of William Wallace, who was appointed the Kings Master Mason in 1617. This peculiar and beautiful structure, is situated on a steep embankment sloping down to the valley of the Tyne. Hunnewell The Lands of Scott says: this Jacobean mansion was that of Ravenswood in The Bride of Lammermoor. There is, of course, a ghost-room in the upper part of the house; but I saw nothing uncanny about it, twice that I was there. In 1630, Lord Winton had completed half of the house, beginning at Wallaces Tower, which had been burned, and continuing as far as Jacobs Tower. Another room, called the Kings Chamber, is said to have been occupied by Charles I when he came to Scotland to be crowned in 1633, although most records have him staying at Seton Palace. Thinking that better times were now at hand, the Earl of Winton caused to be carved on a fine stone tablet upon the frontispiece of his new building a crown supported by a thistle between two roses, signifying the union of Scotland and England. Under it he caused to be inscribed in deep letters of gold this Latin verse: Unio Nune Stoque Cadoque Tuis. Mylne makes a note upon this, saying: Ye Union was ye cause of the families ruin. The Wintons tenure lasted until 1715 when George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton engaged in supporting the Jacobites. He was captured and taken to the Tower of London, and ultimately forfeited his land. The Earls capture ended an era when kings were entertained and master craftsmen were engaged fresh from Edinburgh Castle to embellish Winton House in the style of the Scottish Renaissance. In the absence of the Earl but in his name, Winton was requisitioned by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 when his rebel army camped on the Winton estate. Winton is now the family home of Sir Francis and Lady Ogilvy.  Fountainhall  34 mile 1.2 kilometres south-west of Pencaitland is Fountainhall, a late 16th-century mansion extended in the early 17th century on the same intimate scale and with the same materials, fine-grained harlings matching the pale yellow sandstone of the chimneys, crowstep gables, and other dressings. The estates original name was Woodhead, and was purchased by John Pringle in 1635 who carried out extensive alterations and enhancements. On 13 August 1681 the estate was purchased by John Lauder of Newington, a rich Baillie of Edinburgh, for whom the house and lands were erected into the feudal barony of Fountainhall, becoming the seat of that family. Tradition states that the part of the property to the east contained a cour",

    "text": "Arthur Harrison Speedy Graubart December 8, 1901  August 12, 2003 was a United States Navy captain, and the last commander of the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen after the ships transfer as a war prize from Nazi Germanys Kriegsmarine to the US Navy.  Youth  Graubart was born in Albany, New York, as the youngest of three children to Hungarian and Austrian immigrants. His father was a salesman who came to America when he was 15 to avoid the draft. At an early age, Arthur Graubart showed an aptitude for mathematics and science, while his sister Ella Graubart went on to become the first female lawyer in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Charleston Harris High School in New York City in 1918. After the US declared war on Germany in 1917, Graubart, age 16, tried to enlist in the United States Marine Corps, but was recognized by an acquaintance of his father and sent home after two days. One day after his graduation from high school, he volunteered for service in the navy.  Early naval career  Graubart entered the United States Naval Academy in 1921, ser. number 59309. As a midshipman, he earned the nickname Speed or Speedy , when one of the members of the track team was injured and Graubart was asked to run in his place. Even though he crossed the finish line almost a half lap behind everyone else, he still earned a critical point for his team, so they nicknamed him Speed and it stuck with him. After graduation in 1925, his first assignment was on board the light cruiser USS Cincinnati, which in 1927 was involved in the Nicaragua Banana Fleet operations to protect American refugees during the countrys civil war. In 1927 Graubart reported to the Officers Submarine School at Naval Submarine Base New London. Upon completion, he was transferred to the submarine USS R-2, where he served until 1931. In 1932 Graubart was assigned to the submarine USS Barracuda for a three-year tour of duty. On November 24, 1938, he was transferred from Submarine Division 12 to Submarine Squadron 4, serving on the submarine USS Porpoise, where he served until 1939.  Assistant naval attaché in Nazi Germany  Graubart, fluent in German due to his family background, was transferred to Germany in 1931, where he studied with famous professors Adolph Nägel and Richard Mollier at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden, which was then Germanys top technology institute in diesel engines. At the time of his death, Graubart was the oldest living alumnus. On May 24, 1940, then Lieutenant Commander Graubart was appointed assistant naval attaché and became a very keen observer of German Naval tactics in the 1939-1941 period. Graubart was very well connected within the German Navy, and his dinners and Navy soirées became a meeting point of Anti-Nazi circles within the German Navy and of like-minded fellow students. He was in Berlin when Germany declared war on the United States. On December 11, 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo and held at Bad Nauheim prison. Friends in the German Navy intervened on his behalf and sent him extra provisions of food and drink. In mid-1942 he returned home in an exchange of political prisoners.  World War II  After his return from captivity, he was assigned commander of the submarine base in New Guinea, building this base up from scratch, supporting Americas Pacific campaign at the heart of submarine warfare. He served in Submarine Divisions in Perth and Brisbane, Australia. His excellent organizational skills, expertise in submarine diesel engines and the speedy repairs on his watch confirmed once again his nickname Speedy. In 1942, he was aboard USS Helm for testing new torpedoes. Mid-1944, he received orders to report to the Pentagon and became a member of the working group preparing the comprehensive manual on the German Armed Forces, titled U.S. War Department Technical Manual TM-E 30-451: Handbook on German Military Forces, first issued to troops in loose-leaf format from February 1945 on and published on 15 March, 1945. In late 1944, Graubart, by now promoted to captain, was posted to London and entered Germany with advancing U.S. troops in December 1944. Before the unconditional surrender, he was first flown to Frankfurt, then to Berlin, as member of what was to become the Tripartite Naval Commission. His CO, Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Germany since December 1944, sent Graubart as his representative to the official surrender of the German Navy at Field Marshal Bernard Montgomerys headquarters in Lüneburg, where Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, General Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, signed an instrument of surrender of all German armed forces in the Netherlands, northwest Germany and Denmark on 4 May 1945. Graubart was also present when the German surrender was signed at General Dwight D. Eisenhowers headquarters in Rheims on May 7, 1945, and at Marshal Georgiy Zhukovs headquarters in Berlin Karlshorst on May 8. Nicknamed the Beast",

    "text": "The Polynesian Triangle is a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: Hawaii Hawaiʻi, Easter Island Rapa Nui and New Zealand Aotearoa. This is often used as a simple way to define Polynesia. Outside the triangle, there are traces of Polynesian settlement as far north as Necker Island Mokumanamana, as far east as Salas y Gómez Island Motu Motiro Hiva, and as far south as Enderby Island Motu Maha. Also, there have once been Polynesian settlements on Norfolk Island and the Kermadec Islands Rangitahua. By the time the Europeans first arrived, these islands were all uninhabited. Today, the most numerous Polynesian peoples are the Māori, Hawaiians Kanaka Maoli, Tongans, Samoans, Niueans and Tahitians. The native languages of this vast triangle are Polynesian languages, which are classified by linguists as part of the Oceanic subgroup of Malayo-Polynesian. They ultimately derive from the proto-Austronesian language spoken in Southeast Asia 5,000 years ago. There are also numerous Polynesian outlier islands outside the triangle in neighboring Melanesia and Micronesia.  History  Anthropologists believe that all modern Polynesian cultures descend from a single protoculture established in the South Pacific by migrant Malayo-Polynesian people see also Lapita culture. There is also some evidence that Polynesians ventured as far east as Salas and Gómez Island and as far south as the sub-Antarctic islands to the south of New Zealand. However, none of these islands are considered part of Polynesia proper, as no viable settlements have survived. There are remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century on Enderby Island in the Auckland Islands. A shard of pottery was also recorded to have been found in the Antipodes Islands, but the Te Papa museum in Wellington has stated that they do not possess this shard and that the original description of the find did not say anything about its being Polynesian in origin. In contrast to the shape of a triangle, another theory states that the geography of Polynesian society and navigation pathways more accurately resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on Raiātea French Polynesia and tentacles spread out across the Pacific. In Polynesian oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as Taumata-Fee-Faatupu-Hau Grand Octopus of Prosperity, Tumu-Rai-Fenua Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth and Te Wheke-a-Muturangi The Octopus of Muturangi.

    "text": "The Niobid Painter was an ancient Athenian vase painter in the red-figure style who was active from approximately 470 to 450 BC. He is named after a calyx krater which shows the god Apollo and his sister Artemis killing the children of Niobe, who were collectively called the Niobids. The krater is known as the Niobid Krater and is now housed at the Louvre in Paris. In his other work he shows a preference for Amazonomachy scenes and three-quarter-view faces. His student Polygnotos continued his style of vase painting.  Name vase  The massacre of the Niobids by Apollo and Artemis is shown on side B of the Niobid Krater. This story is rarely represented in Greek art. Niobe had bragged that she was superior to the goddess Leto because she had seven boys and seven girls, while Leto was mother to just two children, Apollo and Artemis. To punish Niobe for her hubris, Leto sent Apollo and Artemis to kill all of Niobes children with arrows. It is uncertain what is being depicted on side A as none of the figures is labeled. Only Heracles and Athena are clearly recognized. There are several hypotheses about what the other figures represent. One option is that they are the Argonauts awaiting favorable winds in Iolcos. Alternatively the scene depicts the episode of Heracles descent into Hades to rescue Theseus and Pirithous, who were guilty of an attempted abduction of Persephone. Another possibility is that Heracles is a statue and that the men surrounding him are Athenian soldiers who wish to place themselves under the protection of the divine hero before the Battle of Marathon. The Athenians attributed their victory in that battle to the support of Heracles and instituted a cult to him. A single arrow in the lower right corner of side B probably protrudes from a dead Niobid hidden behind the landscape. The implied presence of a body which is not actually represented was a remarkable novelty in vase painting. The Niobid Painter also attempted to draw the scenes in three dimensional space by adding multiple levels to the landscape where the scenes take place. This change was inspired by contemporary wall and panel paintings which also used multiple level compositions. However, this feature did not become popular in vase painting and the rest of the Niobid Painters work used a single groundline.

    "text": "The Milesian tale Greek: Μιλησιακά, Milesiaka; Latin:fabula milesiaca, or Milesiae fabula is a genre of fictional story prominent in ancient Greek and Roman literature. According to most authorities, a Milesian tale is a short story, fable, or folktale featuring love and adventure, usually of an erotic or titillating nature. This resulted in a complicated narrative fabric: a travelogue carried by a main narrator with numerous subordinate tales carried by subordinate narrative voices. The best complete example of this would be Apuleiuss The Golden Ass, a Roman novel written in the second century of the Common Era. Apuleius introduces his novel with the words At ego tibi sermone isto Milesio varias fabulas conseram But let me join together different stories in that Milesian style, which suggests not each story is a Milesian tale, but rather the entire joined-together collection. The idea of the Milesian tale also served as a model for the episodic narratives strung together in Petroniuss Satyricon.  Aristidess Milesian Tale  The name Milesian tale originates from the Milesiaka of Aristides of Miletus Greek: Ἀριστείδης ὁ Μιλήσιος; fl. 2nd century BCE, who was a writer of shameless and amusing tales notable for their salacious content and unexpected plot twists. Aristides set his tales in Miletus, which had a reputation for a luxurious, easy-going lifestyle, akin to that of Sybaris in Magna Graecia; there is no reason to think that he was in any sense of Miletus himself. Later, in the first century BCE, the serious-minded historian Lucius Cornelius Sisenna translated Aristides into Latin under the title Milesiae fabulae Milesian Fables for an intellectual relaxation. Through this Latin translation of the work, the term Milesian tale gained currency in the ancient world. Milesian tales quickly gained a reputation for ribaldry: Ovid, in Tristia, contrasts the boldness of Aristides and others with his own Ars Amatoria, for which he was punished by exile. In the dialogue on the kinds of love, Erotes, Lucian of Samosataif in fact he was the authorpraised Aristides in passing, saying that after a day of listening to erotic stories he felt like Aristides, that enchanting spinner of bawdy yarns. This suggests that the lost Milesiaka had for its framing device Aristides himself, retelling what he had been hearing of the goings-on at Miletus. Plutarch, in his Life of Crassus, notes that after the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BCE, the victorious Parthians found collections of Milesian tales in the baggage of the Roman prisoners.  Legacy  Though the idea of the Milesian tale served as a model for the episodic narratives strung together in The Satyricon by Gaius Petronius Arbiter and The Golden Ass by Lucius Apuleius second century CE, neither Aristidess original Greek text nor the Latin translation survived. The lengthiest survivor from this literature is the tale of Cupid and Psyche, found in Apuleius, which Sir Richard Burton observed, makes us deeply regret the disappearance of the others. Aristidean saucy and disreputable heroes and spicy, fast-paced anecdote resurfaced in the medieval fabliaux. Chaucers The Millers Tale is in Aristides tradition. M. C. Howatson, in The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature 1989, voiced the traditional view the Milesian tale is the source of such medieval collections of tales as the Gesta Romanorum, the Decameron of Boccaccio, and the Heptaméron of Marguerite of Navarre. Gottskálk Jensson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, however, offered a dissenting view or corrective, arguing the original Milesian tale was: a type of first-person novel, a travelogue told from memory by a narrator who every now and then would relate how he encountered other characters who told him stories which he would then incorporate into the main tale through the rhetorical technique of narrative impersonation. In 2010, Nicholas Chong published retold Milesian tales in his book The Milesian and Malesian Tales, in which he mentions an Arcadian human sacrifice.  Notes",

    "text": "The actions by governments of communist states Marxist-Leninist states have been subject to criticism across the political spectrum. The actions of communist states have been especially criticized by anti-communists and right-wing critics, but also by other socialists such as anarchists, democratic socialists, libertarian socialists, orthodox Marxists, and Trotskyist communists. Communist states have also been challenged by domestic dissent. According to the critics, the actions and governance of communist parties within these states has often led to totalitarianism, political repression, restrictions of human rights, poor economic performance, and cultural and artistic censorship. Several authors noted gaps between official policies of equality and economic justice and the reality of the emergence of a new class in communist countries which thrived at the expense of the remaining population. In Central and Eastern Europe, the works of dissidents Václav Havel and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn gained international prominence, as did the works of disillusioned ex-communists such as Milovan Đilas, who condemned the new class or nomenklatura system that had emerged under communist states. Major criticism also comes from the anti-Stalinist left and other socialists. Its socio-economic nature has been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of bureaucratic collectivism, state capitalism, state socialism, or a totally unique mode of production. The governments of communist states have been criticized as authoritarian or totalitarian for suppressing and killing political dissidents and social classes so-called enemies of the people, religious persecution, ethnic cleansing, forced collectivization, and use of forced labor in concentration camps. Several communist states have also been accused of genocidal acts, such as in Cambodia, China, Poland and Ukraine, although there is scholarly dispute regarding the Holodomors classification as genocide. Especially in the West, criticism of communist states has also been grounded in criticism of socialism, by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who argued that the state ownership and planned economy characteristic of Soviet-style communism were responsible for economic stagnation and shortage economies, providing few incentives for individuals to improve productivity and engage in entrepreneurship. Anti-Stalinist left and other left-wing critics see it as an example of state capitalism and have referred to it as a red fascism contrary to left-wing politics. Other leftists, including MarxistLeninists, criticize them for repressive actions, while recognizing certain advancements such as egalitarian achievements and modernization under such states. Counter-criticism is diverse, including the view it presents a biased or exaggerated anti-communist narrative. Some academics propose a more nuanced analysis of the governance of communist states. Excess deaths under communist states have been discussed as part of a critical analysis of the governance of communist states. According to Klas-Göran Karlsson, discussion of the number of victims under communist states has been extremely extensive and ideologically biased. Any attempt to estimate a total number of killings by communist states depends greatly on definitions, ranging from a low of 1020 million to as high as 148 million. The criticism of some of the estimates are mostly focused on three aspects, namely that i the estimates are based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable; ii the figures are skewed to higher possible values; and iii those dying at war and victims of civil wars, Holodomor and other famines in communist states should not be counted. Others have argued that, while certain estimates may not be accurate, quibbling about numbers is unseemly. What matters is that many, many people were killed by communist regimes. Right-wing commentators argue that these excess deaths and killings are an indictment of communism, while opponents of this view, including members of the political left, argue that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes instead of communism, and point to mass deaths that they claim were caused by capitalism and anti-communism as a counterpoint to communist killings.  Background and overview  After the Russian Revolution, communist party rule was consolidated for the first time in Soviet Russia later the largest constituent republic of the Soviet Union, formed in December 1922 and criticized immediately domestically and internationally. During the first Red Scare in the United States, the takeover of Russia by the communist Bolsheviks was considered by many a threat to free markets, religious freedom and liberal democracy. Meanwhile, under the tutelage of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the only party permitted by the Soviet Union constitution, state institutions were intimately entwined",

    "text": "Blessing Oghnewresem Okagbare-Otegheri née Okagbare, born 9 October 1988 is a former Nigerian track and field athlete who specialized in long jump and sprints. She is an Olympic and World Championships medallist in the long jump and a world medalist in the 200 metres. Okagbare also holds the womens 100 metres Commonwealth Games record at 10.85 seconds. Her 100 m best of 10.79 made her the African record holder for the event until it was eclipsed by Murielle Ahouré in 2016. On June 17, 2021, Okagbare ran a wind-aided 10.63 100 m. She was the African record holder over the 200 m with a time of 22.04 seconds in 2018, thus making her the second-fastest African female athlete over the distance behind Christine Mboma, who ran an African record of 21.78 s in 2021. Okagbare was the African 100 m and long jump champion in 2010. She has also won medals at the All-Africa Games, IAAF Continental Cup and World Relays. In 2022 Okagbare was issued with an eleven-year competition ban backdated to July 2021 for multiple anti-doping rule violations.  Career   Early life  Of Urhobo heritage, Okagbare was born in Sapele, Delta, in Nigeria. Given her athletic physique, teachers and family encouraged her to take up sports. Initially, she played football as a teenager at her high school and later, in 2004, she began to take an interest in track and field. She participated in several disciplines early on, competing in the long jump, triple jump and high jump events at the Nigerian school championships and winning a medal in each. On the senior national stage, she was a triple jump bronze medalist at the 2004 Nigerian National Sports Festival. Okagbares first international outing came at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics, where she performed in the qualifying rounds of both the long and triple jump competitions. In May 2007, at the All-Africa Games trials in Lagos, she established a Nigerian record of 14.13 meters in the triple jump. At the 2007 All-Africa Games she won the silver medal in the long jump and finished fourth in the triple jump. In the latter competition her Nigerian record was beaten by Chinonye Ohadugha, who jumped 14.21 meters.  Olympic and African medals  As a 19-year-old, she won a silver medal in the womens long jump event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She was selected to compete at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics but did not start either the 100 m or long jump. Okagbare scored a 100 mlong jump double at the NCAA Womens Outdoor Track and Field Championship for University of Texas at El Paso, completing an undefeated collegiate streak for the UTEP Miners that year. She won the Nigerian 100 m title in 2010, running a time of 11.04 seconds, and stated that she was opting out of the long jump in order to save herself for the upcoming African championships. At the African Championships in 2010, she won gold in the long jump again with a distance of 6.62 m while her compatriot Comfort Onyali took silver. Okagbare also won gold in the 100 m distance with a run of 11.03 s flat, while Gabons Ruddy Zang Milama and compatriot Oludamola Osayomi won silver and bronze with runs of 11.15 s and 11.22 s respectively. She won her third gold at the end of the championship as part of the Nigerian 4100 m womens relay team. The team of Okagbare, Osayomi, Lawretta Ozoh and Agnes Osazuwa set a new championship record with a run of 43.43 s, more than a full second ahead of the silver-winning Cameroonian quartet. In 2011, Okagbare continued to build on her earlier endeavours by establishing herself as a 100 m runner. At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Okagbare placed fifth in the 100 m final with a run of 11.12 s. However, she did not make it to the final of the long jump as her best jump of 6.36 m was not enough to get her out of her qualifying group. She concluded her 2011 season by winning three medals at the All Africa Games in Maputo, Mozambique. She won silver in the 100 m behind compatriot Oludamola Osayomi with a run of 11.01 s and gold in the long jump with a jump of 6.50 m. She was part of the Nigerian quartet that won gold in the 4  100 m with a time of 43.34. 2012 was a busy year for Okagbare. She jumped 6.97 m in the long jump in Calabar during the Nigerian championship. She won new continental medals at the 2012 African Championships in Porto-Novo. In the 100 m, she was beaten to silver by Zang Milama, while in the long jump, she claimed gold with a jump of 6.96 m.  London 2012 and 2013 World Championships  At London 2012, Okagbare participated in her second Olympic Games. Going into the Olympics, she had run several fast 100 m races, and there was much anticipation and hope of a medal. However, the 2012 Olympics were not as successful for Okagbare as her 2008 outing. She established a new personal best of 10.92 s in the 100 m semi-final but placed eighth in the final with a run of 11.01 s. 2013 would prove to be a breakthrough year for Okagb",

    "text": "The Cleveland Institute of Art, previously Cleveland School of Art, is a private college focused on art and design and located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States.  History  The college was founded in 1882 as the Western Reserve School of Design for Women, at first attended by one teacher and one pupil in the sitting room of its founder, Sarah Kimball. The school moved several times, first to the attic of the Old Cleveland City Hall, then to the Old Kelly homestead on Wilson Avenue now East 55th Street. Having become a co-educational school, it was renamed the Cleveland School of Art in 1892. After unsuccessful attempts to merge the school with Western Reserve University, the school became independent. In the fall of 1905, the first classes were held in a newly constructed building at the corner of Magnolia Drive and Juniper Road in Clevelands University Circle. Beginning in 1917, the school offered classes for children and adults on weekends and in the summer. The school participated in the WPA Federal Art Project during the Great Depression 1930s. Medical drawing and mapmaking were added to the curriculum during World War II 19391945. The school began offering a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1947 and it officially became the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1949. The college gradually incorporated more academic courses into the curriculum, while retaining its key objective to offer practical training. In 1956 the school moved to a new building at 11141 East Boulevard that it would name for George Gund II, who served as the colleges board president and generous patron from 1942 to 1966. In 1981, the college acquired the former Albert Kahn-designed Euclid Avenue assembly plant which was built by Ford in 1914-1915 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Cleveland Institute of Art named the building the Joseph McCullough Center For Visual Arts following remodeling. In early 2013, CIA announced it would sell its East Boulevard building to the Cleveland Museum of Art and Case Western Reserve University. In 2015, the college unified its operations at the Euclid Avenue site, where it completed construction of an 80,000-square-foot building adjoined to the McCullough Center on the west, and also named for George Gund II. This new George Gund Building has been designed to look crisp and contemporary without detracting from the historic McCullough building next door. It houses: the Peter B. Lewis Theater, the new home of CIAs year-round, nationally acclaimed Cinematheque film program the Reinberger Gallery for public exhibitions; CIAs programs in Animation, Ceramics, Drawing, Game Design, Glass, Graphic Design, Illustration, Industrial Design, Interior Architecture, Jewelry  Metals, Life Sciences Illustration, Painting, Photography  Video, Printmaking, and Sculpture  Expanded Media the American Greetings Welcome Center the Admissions and Financial Aid offices administrative operations This campus unification fully connects CIA to the new Uptown development of retail, restaurants, and residential construction anchored by CIA to the east and the new home of the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland to the west. Uptown Phase II, at the corner of Euclid Avenue and Ford Drive, includes CIAs new freshman residence hall that opened in August 2014.  Academics  The institute offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts in many majors as well as study abroad programs, mobility programs, and internships. Services for students include Career Services and Center for Writing and Learning Support. Other academic programs include: Continuing Education Pre-College Programs Summer Workshops Young Artist Programs  Accreditation  The school is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools NCA and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design NASAD.  Rankings  In 2020, Cleveland Institute of Art was named a Best Midwestern College by the Princeton Review. In 2015, CIA was the only college of art and design to achieve this designation. Princeton Review is an education services company widely known for its test preparation programs and college and graduate school guides. In 201819, Money magazine named Cleveland Institute of Art to its Best Colleges for your Money ranking.  Facilities  Cleveland Cinematheque, a nationally recognized alternative film theater, is part of Cleveland Institute of Art. The recently completed 2015 George Gund Building adjoins the historic Joseph McCullough Center for the Visual Arts at 11610 Euclid Avenue. Reinberger Gallery presents free rotating art exhibits, events and lectures. Visiting artists often present lectures and symposia. The gallery is closed on Sundays. CIAs Uptown Residence Hall houses some 130 first-year students in the Uptown Development on Euclid Avenue.

    "text": "Reginald Smyth 10 July 1917  13 June 1998 was a British cartoonist who created the popular, long-running Andy Capp comic strip.  Early life and military service  He was born in Hartlepool, County Durham, England, the son of Richard Oliver Smyth, a shipyard worker, and his wife, Florence, née Pearce, the oldest of five children his siblings being Lily, Harry, Laura and Jimmy. With his father chronically unemployed, he grew up in poverty, and often referred to himself as a canvas shoes kid. He attended Galleys Field School on the Hartlepool Headland but left at fourteen to take a job as a butchers errand boy. In 1936, after a period of unemployment, he joined the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and was posted to Egypt. His father died during his service. He served during the Second World War in the North African Campaign, and was assigned to a tank demolition team. Promoted to sergeant, he was demoted to corporal for a minor disciplinary offence, and was ultimately medically discharged for a stomach ulcer after a stint in an Edinburgh hospital in 1945. He was awarded the 1939-1945 Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal 1939-1945, for his service. During this time he developed his talent for drawing, designing posters for amateur dramatic productions and selling cartoons to Cairo magazines.  Early cartooning career  After the army, he took a job as a telephone clerk for the General Post Office in London. He married Vera Toyne in 1949; they had no children. He continued to design theatrical posters in his spare time, and was advised to become a professional cartoonist. He sent thirty cartoons to an agent, who sold two to Everybodys Weekly for more than his weekly wage at the GPO. While retaining his day job, he was soon drawing sixty cartoons a week, using Reg Smythe as his professional name. The cartoonist Leslie Harding alias Styx worked for the same agent, and became his mentor. He contributed to publications like the Fishtraders Gazette and the Drapers Record, and drew sketches of council meetings for local newspapers. In 1950 he went freelance, and drew cartoon features like Smythes Speedway World for Speedway World and Skid Sprocket for Monthly Speedway World, as well as cartoons for the London Evening Standard, Reveille, Punch, and the Daily Mirror, where he contributed to the papers Laughter Column.  The Daily Mirror and Andy Capp  In 1954 the Daily Mirrors art editor, Philip Zec, gave Smythe a regular daily cartoon, Laughter at Work. Then, in 1957, he was asked by Mirror editor Hugh Cudlipp to create a cartoon character for the papers Manchester edition. He thought up Andy Capp, a stereotypically lazy, selfish working-class northerner in a flat cap, and his long-suffering wife Flo named after Smythes mother, during the seven-hour drive from his mothers house in Hartlepool to London. Capp is thought to have been based on Smythes father, although Smythe never confirmed that, perhaps because in one early cartoon he depicted Andy as a wife-beater, something he later regretted. Smythes mother recognised her late husband in Andy, although she insisted Richard was not a violent man. Capps headgear was inspired by a fellow spectator at a football match Smythe had attended when young, who took off his cap when it started to rain, because he didnt want to wear a wet cap at home that evening. Originally commissioned for the Mirrors northern edition, Andy Capp was soon appearing in all editions nationwide. The first collection of Andy Capp cartoons was published in 1958. The strip became internationally popular, appearing in at least 700 newspapers in 34 countries, including the Chicago Sun-Times in the USA. While in America the title became Andy Capp - Our English Cousin, the punning resisted translation: in Sweden it was titled Tuffa Viktor, in Germany Willi Wacker, in Austria Charlie Kappl, in Italy Carlo e Alice instead of Andy and Flo when published by La Settimana Enigmistica from 1960 to 2008. Later it was renamed Andy Capp when published in Eureka magazine from 1967 to 1984, in The Netherlands Jan met de Pet, in France André Chapeau, in Turkey Güngörmez Dursun, in Iceland Siggi sixpensari and in Denmark Kasket Karl. Later he was called Linke Loetje when published in the Volkskrant newspaper. In 1982 an Andy Capp musical was produced, starring Tom Courtenay with music by Alan Price, first in Manchester, later in London, and then to great success in Finland. A TV series aired on ITV in 1988, written by Keith Waterhouse and starring James Bolam, but ratings were poor and a second series was cancelled.  Later life  Smythe returned to his hometown of Hartlepool in 1976, living a reclusive life on a large estate. His first wife, Vera, died in 1997, and in 1998 he married Jean Marie Glynn Barry, but later the same year he died of lung cancer. He had left a stockpile of more than a years worth of Andy C",

    "text": "Huey Tum Ajnabi lit. You Turned Stranger is a 2023 Pakistani historical romantic drama film, written and directed by Kamran Shahid in his debut. Set during the events of the Fall of Dhaka, the story revolves around two lovers played by Mikaal Zulfiqar and Sadia Khan. After two years of development since 2014, three years of filming, and then post-production phase and further delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, the film was released on Eid al-Fitr, 22 April 2023, by Shahid Films and Mandviwalla Entertainment.  Premise  BBC Urdu quoted the director saying that the film revolves around two lovers, Zeenat and Nizam, who meet in Dhaka University when there is a war happening in former East Pakistan during 1970s. They have to face the fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists, and choose one among the love or the nation.  Cast   Production   Development  Kamran Shahid, a journalist by profession, revealed that after he was inspired with the book Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War by Sarmila Bose, he began writing the script in 2014. After two years of pre-production, he took self-responsibility to direct the film as well, marking his debut in this field despite being a novice. The director called its genres to be romantic movie more than a political one, based on before and after the 1971 war, so he characterized only three political figures in the film; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and Indira Gandhi.  Casting and filming  In November 2016, Dawn Images reported that Sadia Khan and Mikaal Zulfiqar have signed for the lead roles in a film split between East and West Pakistan. Other actors involved were named to be Alyy Khan and Shamoon Abbasi. The project was under the working title The Trial and initially intended to be released in March 2017. An earlier report in March had also suggested the involvement of actress Resham. Later, in November 2018, Vogue India reported Ayesha Omar being a part of this film as well. Principal photography started in late-2016 and took place in Karachi and Lahore. Though the film was self-financed, they received logistical supports by the Inter-Services Public Relations as well.  Post-production  After being wrapped up, the film went into the post-production phase in 2019. They had another intention of releasing it either on the festive holiday in 2020, or at the fiftieth anniversary of the Fall of Dhaka in 2021. But the plans ware scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and closure of the nationwide cinemas. Ishtiaq Ahmed served as the cinematographer, Sreejesh Nair as the sound designer, Scott Newman as the VFX artist, Rizwan AQ as the film editor, Baqir Abbas as the film score composer, and the directors father Shahid Hameed as the film producer. The musical instruments, color grading techniques, and wardrobe stylings were also inspired from that era to depict the proper period.  Soundtrack  Reportedly, the film soundtrack consists of 11 songs by various artists. The title track is performed by Baqir Abbas with Ali Zafar, with lyrics by Abass Tabish, which is said to be inspired by Faiz Ahmad Faizs poetry Hum Kay Thehray Ajnabi. Other tracks include Ranjhy Bina by Abida Parveen, Sunri Pawan by Maria Meer, Naina by Naveed Nashad and Beena, Teri Or by Asim Azhar, rendition of Mere Rashke Qamar by Saima Jahan, a rendition of Tajdar-e-Haram, etc.  Release   Theatrical  In September 2019, Huey Tum Ajnabi was revealed to be the title. The film trailer was launched in February 2023. It was released on 22 April 2023, with another film Money Back Guarantee, and collected Rs. 2 crore during the Eid al-Fitr holidays. It is produced by the Shahid Films and distributed by the Mandviwalla Entertainment.  Home media  In November 2024, the project was revamped and released as a 36-episode TV series by Pakistan Television Corporation, following the similar format as was of 2015 film Bin Roye and its subsequent TV series.  Critical reception  In a review for PakistaniCinema.net, Azadar Kazmi wrote that the shift between the romantic track and the historical drama is bizarre, however, praised the VFX and war scenes. Nida Usman Chaudhry wrote in The Friday Times that the technique of inserting song after song is a distraction, however, praised the VFX, cinematography and film score in some areas. Omair Alavi compared it with the other local releases depicting the same period, including Jo Bichar Gaye 2022, Khaab Toot Jaatay Hain 2021, and Khel Khel Mein 2021, and called this as the weaker project in his review in VOA Urdu. Mohammad Kamran Jawaid of Dawn called the films tone and style of being decades older from the VHS timeline, and despite he noted some issues, he called it still manages to hold the stylistic flair of a big-screen movie. Fizza Abbas of Dawn Images rated the film 2 out 5, noting some limitations in storytelling but brilliance i",

He was known for his self-taught DJ style of house music, mentoring and inspiring younger producers, and for a series of singles, including his 1999 worldwide hit single Get Get Down.  Musical career  Johnson first began DJing in Chicago in 1984 when he was 13, throwing his first party at his eighth grade graduation. He started working as a producer in 1987, doing tracks for Chicago house labels Dance Mania, Relief, Cajual, Nite Life, Undaground Therapy, Defected, DJax Up Beats, Peacefrog, and Moody. His song Get Get Down, while not a critical hit, was a commercial success, peaking within the top ten of the charts in Belgium Wallonia, France, Greece, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in December 1999. In 1997, Johnson and his partner Radek started the Chicago house label Dust Traxx, and had worked with Robert Armani under the name Traxmen and with Gant Garrard as Brother 2 Brother. His 2004 track, Follow This Beat, hit No. 8 on the US Dance chart. Johnsons productions had a particular distinctive soundhis tracks stood outthey were as tuneful as they were pummeling, reckless battering rams that made you want to sing along even as they bowled you over. As described by one journalist, Paul Johnsons signature meld of disco loops, overdriven kicks and unfiltered sleaze was nothing short of alchemy. Even when chopping up the vocals of Leroy Burgess or Roy Ayers, Johnsons records simmered with raucous charisma. Paul Johnson is the first name mentioned in the Daft Punk song Teachers, a tribute to several of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalters house music influences. The three became friends in 1995, with the French duo personally telling Johnson that he was one of the reasons they started to make house, something Johnson described as pretty damn touching.  Personal life and death  In 1987, Johnson was injured by a stray bullet and paralyzed from the waist down. After further health complications and a motor vehicle accident, he had one leg amputated in 2003, and the other in 2010. Johnson spoke about the difficulty of managing his chronic health conditions while being an active DJ and producer. Johnson was known for a big personality, ribald sense of humor, mischievousness and having stories for days. In his later life he was noted for his active and unfiltered social media presence. In 2021, he spoke about the lack of representation and opportunity for black producers in clubs and the house music community. In mid-2021, Johnson contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized in Evergreen Park, Illinois. After an extended illness, he died on August 4, 2021, at the age of 50.

    "text": "The Save the Greenback Act was legislation proposed, but not passed, in the United States Congress in 1995 and 1997 forbidding the phase-out of the United States one-dollar bill. It stated simply, Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the number of Federal reserve notes in the denomination of 1 which are in circulation at any time does not decrease below the number of such reserve notes in circulation as of the date of the enactment of this Act. In a February 24, 1995 speech introducing the Save the Greenback Act, Rep. Thomas M. Davis gave several arguments against phasing out the one-dollar bill: A great number of peoples pockets will be weighted down with heavy change instead of having a few bills tucked into their billfolds . . . one might suspect a conspiracy by clothing manufacturers in drafting the dollar coin proposal, as everyones pockets begin to wear out. Several polls have shown that Americans prefer the one-dollar bill to a dollar coin. Legislation designed to eliminate the dollar bill will an excuse by the special interests to raise prices on everyday items--a future sales tax, to be levied on all Americans but falling the hardest on those who can least afford it. The failure of the Susan B. Anthony dollar demonstrated that introduction of a dollar coin does not save the federal government money. The costs of changing to a 1 dollar coin would be significant to many in the private sector including but not limited to the small town banks which would have to retool their coin counting, wrapping and sorting equipment--costs which would inevitably be passed on to their customers. Notwithstanding these arguments, many people contend that 1 is far too low a denomination for a paper note at todays price levels and point to the example of virtually every other developed country, whose lowest-denomination banknotes are worth several times more. Most vending machines, for example, need to install dollar bill readers because their commodities have become more expensive due to inflation, a problem compounded by the bills often being crumpled, torn, or otherwise unreadable. Furthermore, the continuation of the dollar bill discourages any meaningful reform of the coinage, as people would be slow to use any dollar coin with the dollar bill still around simply out of habit, as proven with the Sacagawea dollar. Lastly, other countries, including the entire Eurozone, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, have successfully made similar transitions. For comparison, here are the lowest-denomination banknotes of some other developed countries with equivalent U.S. dollar value in exchange, as of August 23, 2015: In contrast, poorer countries with weaker currencies, such as Argentina or Ukraine, often have low-valued bills because of inflation having eroded their value.

The Alcan Land Port of Entry LPOE on the Alaska Highway manages entry into the US, while the Beaver Creek Port of Entry just outside of Beaver Creek, Yukon, manages entry into Canada. The current buildings of the Alcan LPOE and Beaver Creek Point of Entry were opened in 1972 and 1983, respectively.  Location and operations  The AlcanBeaver Creek Border Crossing is serviced by the Alcan LPOE on the US side of the border and the Beaver Creek Point of Entry on the Canadian side. The Alcan LPOE is located in a remote area on the Alaska Highway, surrounded mostly by undisturbed forest, wetlands and tundra. It is the only port of entry between interior Alaska and Yukon that offers year-round, 24-hour service for both personal and commercial traffic.  History  Until 1971, the US operated its AlaskaYukon border station at Tok, Alaska, nearly 145 kilometres 90 mi away from the border. This station inspected traffic entering the US on both the Alaska Highway and the Top of the World Highway. Between 1971 and 1972, US border inspection stations were constructed near the border both at Alcan and at the Poker CreekLittle Gold Creek Border Crossing. The Alcan LPOE was opened in 1972. Meanwhile in Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency had begun border inspection services after World War II, at a repurposed army building on mile 1206, north of Beaver Creek. The architects Pete Eikland and Billy Blair constructed a new customs building for Canada on mile 1220.5 sometime before the 1950s, but services were moved once again in 1958 to a new building in the middle of Beaver Creek. Due to its location and design, many tourists mistook the customs building for a gas station or food stand and drove past it. Canadian customs officers often chased after vehicles with a flashing light and siren to alert motorists before they left Beaver Creek. After years of petitioning by locals, customs services were moved once again in 1983 to a new steel building located past the Beaver Creek Airstrip, avoiding confusion. It is situated at 622431N 1405134W, 28.6 kilometres 17.8 mi away from the actual border, the furthest from the border crossing of any Canadian border station.

    "text": "A cornicello Italian pronunciation: korniˈtʃɛllo, cornetto Italian for little horn  hornlet; korˈnetto, corno Italian for horn, or corno portafortuna Italian for horn that brings luck is an Italian amulet or talisman worn to protect against the evil eye or malocchio maˈlɔkkjo in Italian and bad luck in general, and, historically, to promote fertility and virility. In Neapolitan, it is called curniciello or variants thereof. The amulet is also sometimes referred to as the Italian horn.  Origins and styles  A cornicello is a twisted horn-shaped charm often made of gold, silver, plastic, bone, terracotta, or red coral. Cornicelli are thought to be modeled after an eland horn, to represent fertility, virility, and strength. The shape and colour of the red cornicelli are reminiscent of a chili pepper. The evil eye is believed to harm nursing mothers and their babies, bearing fruit trees, milking animals, and the sperm of menthe forces of generation. In addition to being worn as jewelry, cornicelli are sometimes hung from the rearview mirrors of cars based on the older custom of using them to protect draft horses, and in houses. The cornicello is also linked to Greek and Roman mythology. The cornucopia became a symbol of fertility and the earth after Zeus broke a horn from a goat. He filled it with fruit and flowers and gave it to his caretaker. The coral of which it is often made is sacred to Venus, goddess of love, fertility, sex, and prosperity. Silver, of which it is also often made, is sacred to Luna, goddess of the moon. The phallic shape and red color is also a reference to Priapus, a male fertility god. A regionally popular amulet, they are most often worn by Italian men in Southern Italy, and especially in the region of Campania, as well as Lazio, Apulia, Basilicata and to a lesser extent in Sicily and Calabria. It can also be found among descendants of Italian immigrants in other countries.  Related  Possibly related to the corno is the mano cornuta or horned hand. This is an Italian hand gesture or an amulet imitative of the gesture to ward off the evil eye. Mano means hand and corno means horn. This gesture is performed with the hand levelled or pointing down, or at least slightly downward, usually with a swivelling or oscillating motion.  References",

    "text": "Compound empowerment refers to the way in which public infrastructure is used to radically increase the accumulation of private wealth. The term denotes how commonwealthtax-supported resources, such as public education, financial and legal infrastructure, are translated into private or corporate profit. While wealth might be generated in part by intangible or personal qualities such as intelligence or a strong work ethic, this wealth is compounded by empowering structures such as access to stable markets, consistent law enforcement, and the use of resources held in common, such as public roads. The greater the wealth of an individual or corporation, the more they use commonwealth to increase and sustain their earnings.  Private wealth and common wealth  The concept of compound empowerment stresses the degree to which the acquisition of great private wealth depends upon common structures. For example, while a wealthy individual such as Bill Gates might owe his status as the worlds richest man largely to his intelligence and innovation, his ability to earn and maintain his fortune was and is compounded by public resources held in common. According to theorists such as George Lakoff, the prominent cognitive linguist and founder of the non-partisan think tank the Rockridge Institute, Bill Gates built his company with many employees educated in public schools and universities. Tax-funded research helped develop computer science and the Internet. Trade laws negotiated and enforced by the government protect his ability to sell his products abroad. These are but a few of the ways in which Mr. Gates accumulation of wealth was empowered by the commonwealth and by taxation. The inextricability of private wealth and public resources was influentially formulated by the political philosopher John Rawls, who argued that wealth is arbitrary from a moral point of view, as those factors that enable the accumulation of wealth in society are largely contingentthat is, are the outcome of luck more than of morally relevant activity.  Compound empowerment and fair taxation  Compound empowerment has been evoked to justify progressive taxation and other policies that stress the fundamental fairness of taxing wealthy individuals and corporations in a manner commensurate with their earnings. Because private capital is compounded by infrastructural resources held in common, supporters of progressive taxation argue that rich individuals and businesses should be called upon to support the infrastructures that enable the acquisition and maintenance of their wealth. Since a poor individual uses compound empowerment to a far lesser degree than wealthy individuals, it follows that the former would pay a smaller portion of taxes than the latter. Advocates of tax cuts or other policies that mitigate the taxation of the wealthy tend to argue that progressive taxation punishes the rich for their superior performance in the market. The concept of compound empowerment, on the other hand, argues that having generated their wealth in part through public structures, fairness demands an equitable return to those structures through graduated taxation.

    "text": "Handheld Torch is the debut album by Melbourne band Tarmac Adam. It was released in 2003 and featured two former Crowded House members, bassist Nick Seymour and drummer Paul Hester. The album was produced by Seymour. The album began as a solo production by singer-songwriter Matt ODonnell, who took time off work as an occupational therapist to record some of a set of 25 songs he had written. He recruited guitarist Sean McVitty and drummer Hester, who in turn introduced ODonnell to Seymour. Seymour began producing the album and in mid-2002 returned with ODonnell to his Dublin base to work on vocals, where the set list was reduced to 10 songs. On their return to Melbourne, the project was joined by multi-instrumentalist Steve Paix and in January 2003 the album was mixed by US engineer Rob Feaster. The album was funded by ODonnell after approaches to record companies by Seymour for a recording deal were rebuffed. ODonnell explained: I got to a certain age where I was working as a public servant for long enough and thought Id like to make another record and make it in a certain way. I borrowed the money to do it. Seymour said: On this record when I started working with Matt and Sean, we had songs that were the basis of the record realised. I sent them out to all these AR guys and record company stiffs that I had known over the years and got absolutely no reply. I followed up with phone calls and theyd say they werent interested or werent signing anything. I realised that because of the digital age you make your own records in the back garden and do a lease deal. It is a real drag but thats what you have to do. You have to come up with the money yourself to get Pro-Tools and the good speakers for your spare room. It is part of the DJ culture but a lot of kids who dont have money dont get money thrown at them anymore. It means the ones coming up the ranks are predominantly middle-class to upper-class kids.

    "text": "Marcello Creti 16 April 1922, in Rome  1 January 2000, in Sutri was an Italian inventor, gem prospector, and reported healer who for a time led a group in a farm called Sapientia. In youth he was hailed for his inventions and in 1940 won the Gold Medal of the Fascist Syndicate of Inventors. One of these inventions involved the automobile. Later in life he became known for his eccentric views and was included in The Big Book of Weirdos by Carl A Posey and Gahan Wilson.  Biography  Born in Rome into a wealthy family, Creti claims that, from an early age, he would see complex machines and diagrams in his dreams or while in a trance, which he would then reproduce when he regained consciousness and begin to patent. His father, a Kardecist spiritism, believes that his sons activity is attributable to other entities and therefore encourages his son to participate in séances until Marcello himself becomes convinced that he is a Mediumship. He immediately attracted the attention of newspapers which referred to him as Italys youngest inventor and Benito Mussolini himself, who received him and encouraged him. In 1947, he purchased the ruins of the Benedictine monastery of San Luca located in the municipality of Guarcino to establish the Centro Romano Esperimenti Tecnico Industriali C.R.E.T.I. Roman Center for Technical and Industrial Experiments, where, among other activities, he gave free lessons to underprivileged children. In the 1960s, he set aside, albeit not completely, his work as an inventor to devote himself to exploration, which was another of his great passions. He undertook numerous journeys; the most famous, which was followed by the production of a documentary, was to the North Pole. In the 1970s, his studies focused on Archaeology and Mineralogy. The large amount of material he found enabled him to open a permanent mining exhibition at the Marcello Creti Cultural Association in Sutri. He founded the Ergoniani group in Sutri, which aims to prepare supermen and superwomen thanks to Ergos, or the radiant energy that governs all scienceref. However, Creti subsequently abolished this name and everything related to it, continuing its activities as the Marcello Creti Cultural Association. He died in 2000 shortly after appearing on the Maurizio Costanzo Show.  References   External links  Marcello Creti site",

    "text": "Sir Dennis Charles White 30 July 1910  17 October 1983 was a British colonial administrator who served as the last British resident to Brunei from 1958 to 1959 and later became the countrys first British high commissioner, a position he held until his retirement in 1963. White navigated Brunei through a period of intense political upheaval, including the 1962 Brunei revolt. White struggled to balance British interests, the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien IIIs authority, and rising nationalist movements, often clashing with both the sultans advisors and Malayan leaders over the future of Brunei. His tenure was marked by his firm belief in Bruneis entry into Malaysia, his frustrations with the sultans resistance, and his eventual resignation, partly due to health concerns and British dissatisfaction with his handling of the crisis. After retiring from colonial service, he remained involved in Brunei affairs as the governments agent in the United Kingdom from 1967 to 1983.  Early life and education  Dennis Charles White was born on 30 July 1910 in Muswell Hill, London, to Stafford Charles White, a lieutenant in the Kings Liverpool Regiment who was killed during the First World War in 1917, and Beatrix E. White. He also had a brother, Stafford Radcliffe White, a lieut-commander who was killed aboard HMS Narwhal N45 during the Second World War in 1940. White was educated at Bradfield College.  Career   Early career  White began his career in June 1932 as a cadet in the service of Charles Vyner Brookes Raj of Sarawak and was promoted to district officer in 1938. During the Pacific War, he was held as a Japanese prisoner of war in Kuching from 1941 to 1945. In 1955, he was appointed senior resident minister in Her Majestys Overseas Civil Service and later served as acting British resident to Brunei between June and December 1956.  British Resident to Brunei  In July 1958, White succeeded John Orman Gilbert as British resident to Brunei. By 1957, Gilberts relationship with Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III had deteriorated as the latter sought greater autonomy, gradually diminishing the residents influence and asserting control over the British administrationa shift encouraged by the British through key constitutional amendments that inadvertently expanded his authority via the State Council. White observed these changes and noted that the sultans rising influence was reducing the actual power of the British administration. By the time White took office, the sultan was widely regarded as a modern and enlightened leader, with his popularity bolstered by the success of the first five-year National Development Plan. Significant progress had been made in infrastructure, including the construction of a trunk road and bridges, alongside advancements in social services, education, and healthcare. These developments greatly improved the quality of life in Brunei, particularly in education, where the expansion of secondary schools led to a surge in demand. Anthony Abell believed that Whites arrival would strengthen ties between the State Council and the British administration, and he specifically requested White to do everything in his power to woo the sultan from the influence of the schoolmasters Marsal Maun and Pengiran Muhammad Ali. White disagreed with Anthony Abells radical views, particularly regarding British authority over the police and other security matters, and instead proposed a more pragmatic approach that supported local legislation in managing security, which was ultimately incorporated into the final agreement. However, Abell felt betrayed by the British governments acceptance of the sultans demands, which largely disregarded his constitutional efforts. With the sultan prevailing in his final dispute with Abell, this marked a crucial moment in Bruneis constitutional development. Meanwhile, the Colonial Office advised White to reject a visit from Tun Abdul Razak, the deputy prime minister of Malaya, as Britain sought to avoid any appearance of endorsing a union between Malaya and Brunei. Similarly, Geofroy Tory, the British high commissioner in Malaya, was cautioned against visiting Brunei to prevent the perception that Britain supported closer ties between the two nations. Whites stance aligned with the broader British strategy of maintaining neutrality while monitoring Bruneis political trajectory. By continuing to have friendly ties with the sultan and his advisors and learning from past administration errors, White first won good ties in the community. However, behind the scenes, he presented a bleak assessment to the Colonial Office, believing the sultan was deliberately delaying constitutional reforms. White sympathised with the Partai Rakyat Brunei PRB, considering it Bruneis most democratic party, but privately distrusted the local nobles and radical nationalists. British diplomats, including Abell, grew frustrated during his term as they realised th",

Construction  Life-Line was designed by George H. Hitchings and built at Coos Bay for Reverend G. L. Hall of the American Baptist Publication Society. The vessel was 40.0 feet 12.19 m long, propeller-driven, with a 24-horsepower gasoline engine.  Operations  Once complete, this little ship, under zealot Captain Lund, ran up and down the coast for the Baptist Missionary Society, saving the souls of erring seamen and longshoremen alike.  Sinking  On May 26, 1923, Life-Line was being taken north from Coos Bay to Kelso, Washington, under command of Captain Lund who was operating the vessel with a deckhand. Life-Line foundered off the coast, just south of Neahkahnie, and Captain Lund and the deckhand swam to shore. The vessel washed ashore and was later covered by the sand, where it was forgotten until 1949, when a bulldozer uncovered the wreck.  See also  Lifeline disambiguation  Notes",

    "text": "James Aikman Peter Cochrane, DSO, MC 12 May 1919  5 December 2015 was a Scottish soldier who was awarded the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order during the Second World War. He later had a career in book publishing and printing and wrote a well-received account of his war-time experiences.  Early life  James Aikman Cochrane was born in Glasgow on 12 May 1919, the only son of Margarita Cochrane and Major James Aikman Cochrane. Major Cochrane, who served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers and Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, won the Military Cross, and the Belgian Croix de Guerre avec Palme and Croix de Chevalier de lOrdre de Leopolde. Peter had a younger sister Marigold. His mother decided that he should be known as Peter to differentiate him from his father and a cousin. He spent his early years at his fathers posting in the Far East, and was later educated at Loretto School in Edinburgh. In 1938 he went up to Wadham College, Oxford University, where he read law but left to join the army before he could graduate.  Second World War  Cochrane was commissioned into the Queens Own Cameron Highlanders QOCH in February 1940 and joined the 2nd Battalion of the regiment in Egypt soon afterwards. On 22 October, during the start of the Western Desert Campaign, he and his men were ordered to test the strength of the enemy in a raid on an Italian position near Sidi Barrani. They found vehicles rather than the expected enemy fortifications, and destroying the vehicles, withdrew to base on board the last remaining one. Their interpreter was a Libyan prisoner conversant in Italian. As soon as they started their withdrawal, they were shelled and mortared by enemy positions with rifles. The Libyan driving the vehicle proceeded very slowly stuck in bottom gear, forcing them to abandon the lorry in a wadi. Cochrane ordered his men to disable the vehicle under heavy shelling and tracer rounds. On his return to Company HQ with his small group he was recommended for and received a Military Cross for coolness, resource and initiative under fire beyond praise in that action. In early 1941, the battalion, part of Brigadier Reginald Savorys 11th Indian Infantry Brigade of Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirses 4th Indian Infantry Division, was engaged in a push through Italian Eritrea to dislodge Mussolinis Italian forces from the country. They faced particularly stiff opposition during the advance on Keren, a strategic port located nearby on the Red Sea at Massawa. On 3 February 1941, Cochrane, still only a second lieutenant, commanded two platoons that succeeded in taking a piece of high ground, later known as Cameron Ridge, that was required to direct forward artillery fire. The Commanding Officer CO of the other platoon had been wounded near the start of the action. In what The Glasgow Herald described as a lone attack, Cochrane destroyed two Italian machine gun positions single-handedly with grenades, killing the 13 occupants. He then held the position against counter-attacks and bombardment by artillery and mortars until reinforcements arrived to capture the main peak. For a fortnight he remained in the theatre of war on the frontline with his men, encouraging and leading them under constant enemy fire. They dealt with the snipers and machine-gun posts before withdrawal. He was awarded an immediate Distinguished Service Order DSO, awarded in person by General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief C-in-C of Middle East Command. In March 1941, Cochrane was required to advance to higher ground behind Cameron Ridge. Under artillery and mortar fire, he reached the top with just three men, one of whom was immediately killed. All of the survivors were wounded by shell fire with Cochrane receiving injuries to his head, arm and both legs. He was captured and loaded onto a mule, falling off three times; and then taken to an Italian hospital in Asmara. The doctors brought the unwelcome news that he must choose amputation of both legs or surgery on the gangrenous parts. Without anaesthetic he had to undergo the terrible procedure. Asmara was liberated on 8 April when the 5th Indian Infantry Division took the city, unable to walk, he was again the object of a surgical operation, but this time by a British doctor. He was evacuated to Britain on a journey that took three months by ship. Later in August 1941, Cochrane, having regained the use of his legs, was sent on a lecture tour of 23 cities in the United States, which was then still neutral, with fellow officers Lieutenant Richard Miles of the Royal Navy RN and Flight Lieutenant David Scott-Malden of the Royal Air Force RAF. In Washington DC he met his wife-to-be, Louise Booth Morley of the International Student Service ISS who was organising the visit. The Russians and their delegation included a Ukrainian sniper working for the Soviet Red Army behind German lines, Comrade Lyudmila Pavlichenko, a heroine of Joseph",

    "text": "Prop Cycle is a 1996 arcade game developed and published by Namco.  Gameplay  Prop Cycle is a 3D flying simulator in which the player controls a human-powered aircraft to pop hot-air balloons in the city of Solitar to prevent the city from floating away permanently. The cycle is controlled by using pedals to spin the propeller and handlebars to steer left and right and change altitude.  Plot  The story takes place in a world destroyed by a war 200 years earlier. A hyperspace magnetic weapon called the Tesla Bomb was used in the war, destroying all civilization and completely changing the worlds terrain. The few who survived have abandoned high technology and live a simple but elegant life. The most advanced technology is the steam engine powered by a natural resource called fuel stones. Using improved steam engines with fuel stones, it is possible to fly an airplane. With the worlds terrain made up of steep canyons caused by the destruction from the previous war, personal flight technology is necessary for people to live without destroying nature. However flight technology has undergone a high degree of evolution with the new civilizations collection of knowledge and now its possible to fly freely with only human power. The flying machine is called the Lapperopter. After somebody inadvertently activates a piece of old technology hidden within a shrine, pieces of the protagonists hometown are ripped from the earth and sent flying into the sky. The resulting floating islands are referred to as Solitar, and it is theorised that as long as the machine is active the islands will continue to rise, endangering the trapped townspeople. While efforts are made to deactivate whatever machine is keeping the islands afloat, none are successful. Eventually, a letter from Solitar is received that explains the nature of the mechanism; the machine is powered by balls of energy floating among the islands. It is theorised that a Lapperopter pilot of sufficient skill could travel to Solitar and destroy these energy balls, which would deactivate the machine and save Solitars citizens. Therefore, a test is devised; the protagonist is tasked with flying their Lapperopter around the towns airspace, popping balloons imitating the Solitar machines energy balls. If the protagonist is able to pass three routes, they will be allowed a single chance to travel to Solitar and attempt to disable the machine. If successful, the machine is destroyed and the islands of Solitar fall back to earth in the same place they originally occupied; the protagonist is hailed as a hero by the townspeople.  Development and release  Prop Cycle was designed by Shigeki Toyama, an engineer for Namco that worked on games such as Xevious 1983, Final Lap 1987, and Point Blank 1994. Toyama was inspired to create Prop Cycle after he and another Namco employee finished production on a technical demo where the player rode in a human-powered plane and shot down enemies. The demo didnt use 3D polygons, but instead 2D sprites with scaling techniques that created the illusion of a 3D world. While Toyama didnt find the game itself interesting, he thought its sense of flight was intriguing and decided to turn the concept into a full game. He was also inspired by the Studio Ghibli film Kikis Delivery Service, which stars a young witch flying on a broomstick. Since Prop Cycle was being made as an arcade game, Toyama wanted the game to be highly interactive and have a reason to be exclusive to arcades. He also wanted the game to be unique and distinct from other arcade games, as he never enjoyed repeating already-existing ideas. Toyama worked to allow players to experience the thrill of flying and feeling the wind, and to make the game itself be more than simply defeating enemies. To get an idea of what Toyama was looking for, the development team went out for a day of hang gliding with a camera attached to the gliders wings. The team spent three to four months developing the flying aspect; programmer Naoyuki Koyama didnt understand what Toyama wanted to convey with riding the wind, so to demonstrate he attached a weight to an umbrella to give Koyama an idea of what he was trying to create. Toyama wanted Prop Cycle to have a proper storyline in addition to its unique game concept. Jokingly referring to his role as the projects movie director, Toyama designed the setting, plotline, and characters, and drew the artwork for the villages and level themes. An intentional design choice was that the player had to make it to the last stage in order to understand the story, a decision he has since come to regret. Toyama considered making a Sightseeing mode where players were able to fly anywhere they wanted under a time limit, however the limited development time caused the idea to be scrapped.  Reception  Game Machine claims that Prop Cycle was the second most popular arcade game of August 1996 in Japan. Next Generation state",

    "text": "Susanna Wilkerson Dickinson c. 1814  October 7, 1883 and her infant daughter, Angelina, were among the few American survivors of the 1836 Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. Her husband, Almaron Dickinson, and 185 other Texian defenders were killed by the Mexican Army.  Early life  Susanna was born c. 1814 in Williamson County, Tennessee, and apparently never learned to read or write. She married Almaron Dickinson on May 24, 1829, when she was 15 years old. After acquiring land along the San Marcos River, the couple became DeWitt Colonists two years later. The Dickinsons then constructed a blacksmith shop there and made investments in fellow colonist George Kimbells Gonzales hat business.  Texas Revolution  As the Mexican government increasingly abandoned its federalist structure in favor of a more centralized government, Almaron Dickinson became one of the early proponents of war. He would later join with other volunteers during the Battle of Gonzales, becoming one of the Old Gonzales 18 in the battle which launched the Texas Revolution on October 2, 1835. By the end of the year, the Texian army had driven all Mexican soldiers from the territory. Soon after, Susanna joined Almaron at the former Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar now San Antonio, Texas shortly after his assignment to the garrison there. The Dickinson family lived outside the Alamo, boarding with the Ruiz family. In early 1836, Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led troops into Texas, which arrived in San Antonio on February 23 and immediately besieged the Alamo. It did not even have food stocked inside the mission to withstand the siege. The men thus quickly herded cattle into it and scrounged for food in the recently abandoned houses outside. Susanna and Angelina were among the families of garrison members who were brought inside for safety. For the next twelve days, the Alamo lay under siege. Santa Anna planned an early morning assault for March 6. At 8:10 pm on March 5 the Mexican artillery ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had planned, the exhausted Texans soon fell into the first uninterrupted sleep many had had since the siege began. At 5:30 am Santa Anna gave the order to advance. As the Mexican soldiers began to yell and their buglers sounded, the Texan defenders awakened and rushed to their posts. Susanna, Angelina, and most other noncombatants gathered in the chapel sacristy for safety. She later mentioned that Davy Crockett stopped briefly to pray before taking his assigned position. The Mexican soldiers soon breached the Alamos outer walls. As previously planned, most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel. Almaron Dickinson briefly slipped from his post manning a cannon in the chapel to join Susanna in the sacristy. He yelled Great God, Sue, the Mexicans are inside our walls! If they spare you, save my child!, then kissed her and returned to his cannon. It took an hour for the Mexican army to secure complete control of the Alamo. Among the last Texians to die were the 11 men, including Almaron, manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. The entrance had been barricaded with sandbags, which the Texans were able to fire over. However, a shot from the Mexican 18-pounder cannon destroyed the barricade, and Mexican soldiers entered after an initial musket volley. Although Dickinsons crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers, they had no time to reload. Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza, Bonham, and the remaining Texians grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. If he had succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the chapel, killing Susanna and the other women and children hiding in it. As soldiers approached the sacristy, one of defender Anthony Wolfs sons stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders and was killed. Another Texan was still alive. Jacob Walker, the gunner from Nacogdoches who had remained by his cannon as part of Jim Bonhams and Capt. William Careys artillery company. After there were no more balls left to fire, plugged his cannon with scraps of cast iron and broken pieces of chain and fired at the Mexican soldiers. A Mexican officer trained a force of muskets on them and they became major targets. Jacob Walker, who had remained by his cannon until his wounds kept him from firing his cannon, leaped from the ramp, and dashed to the side of Mrs. Dickinson in one of the chapel side rooms. He had made his way to the side of Mrs. Dickinson, perhaps in hopes that she would be spared to carry messages to his family. During the siege he had often talked with her about his wife and four children. His cousin Asa was also at the Alamo. Asa Walker had come to Texas from T",

    "text": "Revolo is a plug-in parallel hybrid technology that can be retrofitted in both existing and new cars. This technology can also be used in buses and trucks. The technology was developed by KPIT Technologies and the product will be manufactured through a joint venture between Bharat Forge and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration. Pre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive Research Association of India ARAI, Pune have confirmed that the technology provides fuel efficiency improvements by over 40 percent and a reduction in greenhouse gas GHG emissions by over 30. The technology is to be marketed to OEMs and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships.  Background   Planning and concept  The idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008 when he was stuck in Mumbai traffic en route to Pune. KPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from CREST, the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research and a budget under US2 million to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand a sudden surge in power when brakes were applied. The research and development team studied the firing pattern of internal combustion engines and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient, and at the same time offers good performance. Revolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30 kmh in the third gear without straining the engine.  Latest developments  KPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved its durability, and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014. The company will test various vehicles, including passenger cars, with engine sizes between 800 ccs and 2,500 ccs. Production of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by the first half of 2012. The commercial production would begin in 201213.  Technology   Revolo technology details  The Revolo kit is similar to a retrofit compressed natural gas CNG kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package. The kit can be installed in both petrol and diesel vehicles within 46 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a joint venture that KPIT has formed with Bharat Forge. The Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 horsepower electric motor developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic motor controller, leadacid battery pack, mechanical assembly, and coupling, proprietary software for control algorithms of the motor and batteries, and battery management system. As a parallel hybrid, the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic power outlet. Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained.  Plug-in parallel hybrid conversion kit  The conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in the context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the fuel efficiency to twice as compared to existing solutions. Battery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adapted to work with various types of batteries such as leadacid batteries or Lithium-ion batteries. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, leadacid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours. Revolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts them to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations.  Pricing  Revolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the after-market hybrid car kits available in the United States which cost around US20,000. It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of Rs. 100,000.  References   External links  Revolo Website",

    "text": "The Battle of Hansan Island Korean: 한산도 대첩 and the following engagement at Angolpo took place on 15 August 1592. In two naval encounters, Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sins fleet managed to destroy roughly 100 Japanese ships and halted Japanese naval operations along the southern coast.  Background  Yi Ŏkki joined with Yi Sun-sin at Yeosu on 10 August, 1592 Gregorian Calendar. On 12 August, 1592 Gregorian Calendar they rendezvoused with Wŏn Kyun at Noryang, bringing their total fleet strength to 56 warships. At Dangpo, they received news of a Japanese fleet sailing west from Busan. Wakizaka Yasuharus fleet of 73 ships entered Gyeonnaeryang.  Battle  On 15 August 8th day of the 7th lunar month, Yi Sun-sins fleet encountered a Japanese scout vessel and gave chase but broke off after sighting a large fleet of Japanese warships in Gyonnaeryang Strait. Yi Sun-sin sent a small detachment forward to lure the Japanese fleet, and they took the bait, following them into open waters off Hansan Island. The Korean fleet assumed a U-shaped crane formation with large warships such as 2 turtle ships in the center and lighter ships on its wings. The two fleets engaged in battle and most of the Japanese ships were destroyed in the engagement, while Korean reported few losses on their side. The battle lasted throughout the day until the Koreans tired from chasing and returned to open sea. Fourteen Japanese ships that had not engaged in combat escaped, the rest were destroyed. Wakizaka Yasuharu managed to withdraw to Gimhae. News of the Japanese defeat reached Busan within hours and two Japanese commanders, Kuki Yoshitaka and Kato Yoshiaki, immediately set sail with 42 ships for the port of Angolpo, where they hoped to face the Korean fleet close to shore. Yi Sun-sin received news of their movements on 15 August and he advanced towards Angolpo to confront them. This time the Japanese were unwilling to follow the Koreans into open water and stayed onshore. They would not take the bait. In response, the Korean fleet moved forwards and bombarded the anchored Japanese fleet for hours until they retreated inland. Later the Japanese returned and escaped on small boats. Both Kuki and Kato survived the battle.  Aftermath  Wŏn Kyun was left behind to mop up Japanese soldiers marooned on a small isle, but fled after receiving a false report of a large Japanese fleet approaching. The Japanese managed to drift to shore using rafts made from the wreckage of their ships. On 23 August, Hideyoshi Toyotomi ordered naval commander Todo Takatora to reinforce operations in Korea and halted naval operations at Busan.  International recognition  George Alexander Ballard 18621948, a vice admiral of British Royal Navy, complimented Admiral Yis winning streaks by the Battle of Hansando highly: This was the great Korean admirals crowning exploit. In the short space of six weeks actually about 9 weeks, May 7, 1592  July 7, 1592 he had achieved a series of successes unsurpassed in the whole annals of maritime war, destroying the enemys battle fleets, cutting his Hideyoshis lines of communication, sweeping up his convoys, imperilling the situation of his victorious armies in the field, and bringing his ambitious schemes to utter ruin. Not even Nelson, Blake, or Jean Bart could have done more than this scarcely known representative of a small and cruelly oppressed nation; and it is to be regretted that his memory lingers nowhere outside his native land, for no impartial judge could deny him the right to be accounted among the born leaders of men. Historians Hulbert also admired the naval battle, evaluating it as follows. This is the Battle of Salamis in Joseon. This naval battle is the death sentence for Toyotomis invasion of Joseon.  In popular culture  The battle is depicted in the 2022 film Hansan: Rising Dragon directed by Kim Han-min. The Battle of Hansando is also portrayed in episode 74 of the TV drama series Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

    "text": "Cody Canada and The Departed also known as The Departed and Jeremy Plato and The Departed is an American rock band. The band was formed in 2011 by Cody Canada, the former lead vocalist and guitarist for Cross Canadian Ragweed after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada guitars and lead vocals, Jeremy Plato bass guitar and vocals, Peyton Glasco guitar and vocals, and Eric Hansen drums.  History   2010-2012: Formation and This Is Indian Land  After Oklahoma based southern rock band Cross Canadian Ragweed broke up in 2010, Cody Canada decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a Super Group. Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow Yukon, Oklahoma native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves The Departed as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as Cody Canada and The Departed namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview. The band released its first album in June 2011 titled This Is Indian Land through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The bands cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song Staring Down the Sun was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, The Ballad of Rosalie and Skyline Radio both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.  2012-2015: Adventūs  On August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, Adventūs Latin for arrival on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an alternative rock and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: Worth The Fight, Prayer For the Lonely and Flagpole.  2015-2018: HippieLovePunk  Line-Up Changes  In September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road. The band continued performing as a four-piece group. In 2014, the band finished a new album, HippieLovePunk. It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top Alternative Country Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week. The sound was, for the most part, still like the alt-rock sound of Adventūs. Cody Canada and The Departed, as the band was once again known, debuted a new line-up at The MusicFest in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on January 8, 2015. East Texas native Ross Smith replaced Littleton on keyboards and took up rhythm guitars, while Eric Hansen became the drummer in place of Doege. In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song All Nighter on HippieLovePunk at John T. Floores Country Store in Helotes, Texas. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for Micky and the Motorcars Mark McCoy, who had died in Idaho in 2012 while on vacation. The songs Inbetweener and Easy were released as singles. In early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect, honoring 1960s era country music with songs by Johnny Paycheck, Stonewall Jackson and Charlie Walker, among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. Reckless Kellys Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.  2018-present: 3, singles, and Cross Canadian Ragweed Reunion  In early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3-piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single Lipstick from their new album 3, that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. Mike McClure, who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweeds albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd",

    "text": "The Barbra Streisand Album is the debut album by American singer Barbra Streisand, released February 25, 1963, on Columbia Records, catalogue CL 2007 in mono and CS 8807 in stereo. It peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Top LPs, and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA. By 1966, the album had sold over one million copies worldwide. The album was nominated for five Grammys at the 1963 Grammy Awards and won Album of the Year, Best Female Vocal Performance and Best Album Cover. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2006.  Background  Columbia label president Goddard Lieberson initially resisted signing Streisand to a contract, finding her style too close to the cabaret singers he disliked and too far from the understated approach of Jo Stafford or Rosemary Clooney, who recorded for the label in the 1950s. Lieberson relented and agreed to sign her. Nearly three decades later Streisand said: The most important thing about that first contract  actually, the thing we held out for  was a unique clause giving me the right to choose my own material. It was the only thing I really cared about. I still received lots of pressure from the label to include some pop hits on my first album, but I held out for the songs that really meant something to me. Streisand exercised her creative control and chose the straightforward album title, rejecting Columbias choice of Sweet and Saucy Streisand. She once mentioned, I said What is the truth of it? Its the Barbra Streisand album. If you saw me on TV, you could just go to the record shop and ask for the Barbra Streisand album. Despite Liebersons initial reservations, Streisand went on to become one of Columbias most enduring artists. The album was originally conceived as a live recording, since Streisand had made a name for herself performing at New York City nightclubs such as the Bon Soir and the Blue Angel. Her producer Mike Berniker brought a crew to the Bon Soir to record Streisand accompanied by the nightclubs house musicians and her pianist, Peter Daniels. The live recordings were shelved in favor of studio recordings, although the photograph for the album cover was taken during the Bon Soir session. Some material from the Bon Soir sets would later appear on Streisands Just for the Record... retrospective box set in 1991; and, coinciding with the sixtieth anniversary of those sessions, the full recordings were released as Live at the Bon Soir in 2022.  Recording  Recording studio sessions took place January 2325, 1963, at Columbias Studio A in New York City with a budget of 18,000. Material was mostly chosen from Broadway standards, many of which were fairly obscure. Ill Tell the Man in the Street was originally performed by Dennis King in the 1938 production of I Married An Angel, and Whos Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? was taken from the 1933 Disney cartoon Three Little Pigs. Streisands rendition of the Disney song began with the quoting of the first 11 notes from the Cat Theme from Russian composer Serge Prokofievs Peter and the Wolf, which did result in a lawsuit against Columbia Records, from Prokofievs estates, which was settled out of court, with Prokofievs widow receiving half of the proceeds for the unapproved quote. The Disney song ended on a Spike Jones style of rhythm and slide whistles, heard at the end of the track, before the songs fade. Not one of Cole Porters well-known numbers, Come to the Supermarket in Old Peking appeared in a 1958 television special with music by Porter, while A Sleepin Bee came from the 1954 musical House of Flowers. Soon Its Gonna Rain and Much More were both introduced in the 1960 off-Broadway musical The Fantasticks, and the 1930 film Chasing Rainbows provided Happy Days Are Here Again. Cry Me A River was a signature song of singer Julie London, while A Taste of Honey was coincidentally recorded less than three weeks later by the Beatles for their 1963 debut album, Please Please Me. Happy Days Are Here Again was released as Columbia single 42631 with When the Sun Comes Out on the b-side, but it did not chart. Notwithstanding, at the 1964 Grammy Awards, The Barbra Streisand Album won awards in the categories of Album of the Year, Best Female Vocal Performance, and Best Album Cover - Other Than Classical, the latter presented to art director John Berg. The only song recorded but not included on this album was Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered which Streisand and Mike Berniker recorded on two separate dates including a later session on January 29. The song was included instead on Streisands The Third Album using a Peter Daniels arrangement. Streisand chose Century Expanded Italic, the typeface for the album sleeve of her debut album, which would also be used on 19 other Streisand album covers. The album made its digital debut on CD in 1987 and was re-released in a remastered CD edition on October 19, 1993.  Critical reception  AllM",

    "text": "Love You is a song by American country music artist Jack Ingram. It was written by Jay Knowles and Trent Summar. The song was released on June 5, 2006 as the second single from Ingrams album Live: Wherever You Are. It is one of the two studio tracks on the album, which is otherwise a live compilation album.  Content  The song is considered a kiss-off song. Its lyrics feature several phrases where the word fuck is replaced with the word love, most notably in the chorus Love you, love this town  Love this mother-lovin truck that keeps breakin lovin down. There are also more traditional replacements in the song, with dang damn, heck hell, and shoot shit appearing several times in the first verse.  Music video  The music video was directed by Shaun Silva and premiered in June 22, 2006. It shows Ingram performing in a bar, while his girlfriend is outside destroying a pickup truck, which she assumes is Jacks. She scratches love you in the paint of the hood with her car keys, uses a baseball bat to break the windows, and finally shoots out the tires with a shotgun. Jack then comes out of the bar at the end of the song, laughs at the vandalized truck, and then leaves in his own truck, parked several spaces away. The actual owner of the vandalized trucka large, muscular man in a leather vestcomes out of the bar and surveys the damage to his truck, just as the girl flees the scene.

    "text": "Eden Frankfurt German: Eden Hochhaus also known as Tower 90 is a high-rise residential building in the Gallus district of Frankfurt, Germany. Built between 2018 and 2022, the tower stands at 96.5 m 317 ft with 29 floors and is the current 44th tallest building in Frankfurt.  History   Planning  The construction of the 98-meter-high residential building with 27 floors began with the groundbreaking ceremony on 29 May 2018, and was originally scheduled to be completed in 2021. The completion date has been postponed several times because the building has not been approved by the authorities. The first apartment keys were then handed over in June 2023. The high-rise was built on the former Bosch site next to Mainzer Landstrasse. The hotel high-rise The Spin, a residential complex of ABG Frankfurt Holding with 270 apartments and a station on the U5 subway line were built on the same 13,700 square meter plot. The client was the investor gsp Städtebau from Berlin, which built the project until the underground car park was completed. After that, the new owner Immobel took over the project development. A height of around 90 metres was originally planned. In addition, the number of planned condominiums was increased from 200 to 263, but these will be smaller than originally planned and will mostly have one to three rooms. There will also be three penthouses. In addition to a concierge service, there will be a fitness studio. Panoramic windows are planned for the rooms, and the building façade will be covered in greenery. The 420-space underground car park will also be available for the surrounding buildings. The construction site is part of the European Quarter. Nearby is the building complex with the Skyline Plaza shopping center and the Grand Tower residential high-rise, which was built by gsp Städtebau.  Architecture  Originally, Robert Bosch GmbH wanted to build an office tower on the site formerly used by the company Tenovis. In 2013, this plan was changed and a residential tower with a height of between 60 and 90 meters was to be built. Because no investor could be found, Robert Bosch GmbH sold the property in 2015 to ABG Frankfurt Holding, gsp Städtebau and a private investor. Plans were presented for the construction of a hotel tower with a maximum height of 115 meters and a residential tower with a height of around 90 meters. In addition, a block perimeter development with apartment buildings was to be built. Completion was planned for 2020 or 2021. At the beginning of 2016, a realization and ideas competition was announced, which was won in March 2016 by the architectural firms Jahn and Magnus Kaminiarz  Cie. The design envisaged a 90-meter-high residential tower Tower 90 and a block perimeter development on Europa-Allee. In 2018, the name Eden was announced. It is an allusion to the mythological Garden of Eden. In January 2019, the project developer gsp Städtebau announced that the project had been sold to the Belgian company Immobel.

    "text": "The Emirate of Bukhara was an Uzbek absolute monarchy in Central Asia that existed from 1785 to 1920 in what is now parts of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. It occupied the land between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, known formerly as Transoxiana. Its core territory was the fertile land along the lower Zarafshon river, and its urban centres were the ancient cities of Samarqand and the emirates capital, Bukhara. It was contemporaneous with the Khanate of Khiva to the west, in Khwarazm, and the Khanate of Kokand to the east, in Fergana. In 1920, it ceased to exist with the establishment of the Bukharan Peoples Soviet Republic. The Turco-Mongol tribe of Uzbeks known as Manghits were the rulers.  History  The Emirate of Bukhara was officially created in 1785, upon the assumption of rulership by the Manghit emir, Shah Murad. Shahmurad, formalized the familys dynastic rule Manghit dynasty, and the khanate became the Emirate of Bukhara. As one of the few states in Central Asia after the Mongol Empire not ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan besides the Timurids, it staked its legitimacy on Islamic principles rather than Genghisid blood, as the ruler took the Islamic title of Emir instead of Khan. In the 18th19th centuries, Khwarazm Khiva Khanate was ruled by the Uzbek dynasty of Kungrats. Over the course of the 18th century, the emirs had slowly gained effective control of the Khanate of Bukhara, from their position as ataliq; and by the 1740s, when the khanate was conquered by Nadir Shah of Persia, it was clear that the emirs held the real power. In 1747, after Nadir Shahs death, the ataliq Muhammad Rahim Bi murdered Abulfayz Khan and his son, ending the Janid dynasty. From then on the emirs allowed puppet khans to rule until, following the death of Abu l-Ghazi Khan, Shah Murad assumed the throne openly. Fitzroy Maclean recounts in Eastern Approaches how Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly were executed by Nasrullah Khan in the context of The Great Game, and how Joseph Wolff, known as the Eccentric Missionary, escaped their fate when he came looking for them in 1845. He was wearing his full canonical costume, which caused the Emir to burst out laughing, and Dr Wolff was eventually forced to leave Bokhara, greatly to the surprise of the populace, who were not accustomed to such clemency. In 1868, the emirate lost a war with Imperial Russia, which had aspirations of conquest in the region. Russia annexed much of the emirates territory, including the important city of Samarkand. In 1873, the remainder became a Russian protectorate, and was soon surrounded by the Governorate-General of Turkestan. The Russians forced the abolition of the Bukhara slave trade in 1873, though slavery itself was not formally abolished until 1885. Reformists within the Emirate had found the conservative emir, Mohammed Alim Khan, unwilling to loosen his grip on power, and had turned to the Russian Bolshevik revolutionaries for military assistance. The Red Army launched an unsuccessful assault in March 1920, and then a successful one in September of the same year. The Emirate of Bukhara was conquered by the Bolsheviks and replaced with the Bukharan Peoples Soviet Republic. Today, the territory of the defunct emirate lies mostly in Uzbekistan, with parts in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In the first half of the 19th century it had some influence in northern Afghanistan, as the emirs of the Chahar Wilayat Maimana, Sheberghan, Andkhui, Sar-i Pol nominally accepted Bukharan suzerainty.  Society   Population and religion  Population estimates for Bukhara in the 19th century vary throughout authors. According to the Russian diplomat and orientalist Nikolay Vladimirovich Khanykov, the population was between 2.02.5 million. Another author estimates the population to have been around 3 million in the early 20th century. The Hanafi school of Sunni Islam was the most dominant belief amongst Bukharans. Sufi brotherhoods were popular, particularly the many sects of the Naqshbandi Order Juybaris, Dahbidis, Ahraris. A large minority also followed the Twelver school of Shia Islam, mostly people from Iran who were slaves, former slaves, or their descendants. The eastern Pamir Mountains, under Bukharan rule from the late 19th century, were inhabited by followers of Ismailism. Bukharan Jews also lived in the emirate, mostly in Bukhara and Samarqand. There was also a small Hindu diaspora.  Ethnic groups and identity  The people of the Bukharan emirate were bilingual and often ethnically mixed. Sedentary and nomadic lifestyles sharply contrasted, reflecting the varied geography, which included deserts, steppes, mountains, urban centers, and oases. The phrase turk wa tājik Turk and Tajik expressed this separation by representing the two primary elements of the society. The first element was the tribal nomadic clans of Turkic and Turco-Mongol heritage Uzbek, Turkmen, Kaza",

    "text": "The 1882 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team represented the University of Minnesota in the 1882 college football season. The inaugural Minnesota football team did not have a coach. The first known mention of football at the University of Minnesota was on October 30, 1878 in the Ariel, the student newspaper at the time. It said that Football has been the all-absorbing amusement for the past few weeks. However, in those days, the only games played were against other Minnesota students. Minnesotas first intercollegiate game which has its results recorded took place at the Kings Fair Ground on September 30, 1882, though some secondary sources may incorrectly give the location as the Minnesota State Fairgrounds and the date as September 29, 1882. It was scheduled to be a three team track meet with the University of Minnesota, Carleton College and Hamline University competing. The team from Carleton College was unable to attend, so the other two teams went on with the meet without them. Following the meet, the athletes from Hamline wanted to go home, but were talked into playing a game of football first. A.J. Baldwin, the team captain, was the first Minnesota player to score in an intercollegiate game, leading his team to a 40 victory. According to the Ariel, It is only fair to say that the Hamlines did not have their full strength and the University won by two goals in fifty-five minutes. This ended the day and the crowd dispersed well satisfied with the beginning which had been made in intercollegiate sports. The teams had a rematch a couple of weeks later which was won by Hamline.

    "text": "The 1935 Philadelphia mayoral election was the election of Samuel Davis Wilson.  Background  From the Civil War, Philadelphia politics had been dominated by a Republican Party political machine. However, the machines power waned in the 1920s and 1930s, following a series of corruption investigations and the Great Depression, which destroyed the popularity of the Republican Party nationwide and in urban centers in particular.  General election   Candidates  Jack Kelly, construction magnate and former Olympic rower Democratic Samuel Davis Wilson, Philadelphia city controller Republican  Campaign  Wilson was a strong candidate. He had strong persuasive abilities, being able to take opposing positions on a topic while still seeming sincere. For instance, Wilson, as a mayoral candidate, condemned out of control federal spending. However, once elected mayor, in 1936 he would later assist in guaranteeing that 40,000 of his constituents were on the Works Progress Administration payroll. Wilson was not completely loyal to the national Republican Party, as he had previously campaigned for Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. Wilson was prone to taking a bare-knuckle approach to political discourse, not straying from referring to his opponents by pejoratives as dirty rats and bare-faced liars. Having registered 179,000 new voters after the 1932 election cycle, Philadelphia Democrats hoped to finally take the mayoralty. Democrats believed they had recruited the ideal candidate with millionaire contractor and gold medal Olympian Jack Kelly. Kelly was an opponent of discrimination. He had, himself, been blocked from joining the upper echelons of Philadelphia Protestant society. Kelly reached out to Italians, Jews, and African Americans. He also made an effort to slightly diversify the down-ballot positions on the Democratic Partys ticket.  Results  The race proved to be the narrowest mayoral election that Philadelphia had seen in a long time. Despite Kellys efforts, 56 of black voters and half of Philadelphias ethnic Italian electorate supported Wilson.  References",

The drop is significant, but the homicide rate is nevertheless in the same range the city saw in the mid 1980s, when the city had another 130,000 residents. City leaders credit a sustained focus on repeat violent offenders and increased community engagement for the continued drop, reflecting a nationwide decline in crime. The city recorded a total of 344 homicides in 2015, a number second only to the number recorded in 1993 when the population was 100,000 higher.

    "text": "Frederick J. Bacon 1871-1948 was a late 19th to mid 20th century performer and recording artist on the five string banjo. He was also an inventor and entrepreneur, educator, composer, and designer and manufacturer of banjos. At the height of his performance career he played the banjo nationally. Along with Fred Van Eps and Vess Ossman he was part of a group of banjoists labeled virtuoso in the newspapers. He founded the F.J Bacon Co., possibly as early as 1902, after having invented a new resonator for open-back banjos. It wasnt until 1908 that Bacon came up with Bacon Mfg.  Publishing Co. to sell his banjos and music compositions. During the Big Five tour Bacon became Bacon Mfg. Co in 1911 from Forestdale and incorporated Bacon Mfg. Co. in 1912 dissolved in 1915. In 1918 from New London he called himself Bacon Banjo Mfg. Co. around 1918, and formally the Bacon Banjo Co. Inc in 1920 with E.O Winship and wives. In 1922 his company gained business experience in David L. Day, formerly of Vega. Together they produced Bacon and Day banjos B.D. on the headstock, some of which have been considered worthy of display in museums, as showpieces of artistic impulse from the Jazz Age. Frederick and his wife Cassie were proponents of the classic banjo style of playing banjo, in which the strings are plucked with the fingers, without picks.  Musicianship  Across his career, Fred J. Bacon played a variety of musical styles on the five-string banjo and snare drum. His performances included his own compositions such as The Fascinator and The Conqueror march, classical compositions such as Minuette a lAntique by Paderewski, and arrangements of folk music or minstrel songs, including Massas in the Cold, Cold Ground. Known mainly as a banjo player, he also continued to bring his drum on stage throughout his career, doing drum solos, and in 1936 advertised as a teacher of banjo, guitar, drums and violin. Growing up in Connecticut, he took banjo lessons from Alfred A. Farland when he was 12-years old. Bacon began public performance at 16, in medicine shows, variety shows, and Wild West shows, playing the snare drum and swinging his banjo. His earliest acts included roles with Hornsbys Oats a stage show in Boston and with Broncho Johns Wild West Show as Nebraska Fred. A performance poster in Boston labeled him the Banjo Kid. Bacon began performing on his own, under his really name and teaching the banjo. He married Cassie Maria Bacon in 1890, and the two would travel the country and eventually perform together. By 1911, Bacon had learned to play in a duo style, playing two distinct airs at the same time. In 1918 Bacon was advertised for a concert representing the banjo before the American Guild of Banjoists, Mandolinists and Guitarists, alongside musicians such as concert Mandolinists Samuel Siegel mandolin and William Foden guitar. The trio performed together in concerts between 1904 and 1918. Besides his banjo, Bacon also continued to play his snare drum in concert as late as 1933. He played two solos, Battle Scene and Coming and Going of the Empire Express.  Bacon Banjo Company  Bacons performances became an opportunity to sell banjos as he gained name recognition across the country. By 1907 he was having banjos made for him by Vega to sell as his own. They were sold as far way as Los Angeles and New Jersey. While living in Hartford he started the F. J. Bacon and Company in 1902, with A. E. Squires and G. S. Masleu, selling musical instrument strings. Bacon banjo strings and Bacon violin strings, were sold in music stores in 1903. At the time, he also endorsed Fairbanks banjos in the music store advertisements. In the Cadenza magazine, 1910, he is picture holding a Fairbanks Whyte Laydie. Bacon experimented with musical instrument making. While visiting Brandon, Vermont in 1901 he sold his patent neverslip banjo bridge to W. H. Johnson of that town. Johnson had been making the bridges for the Bacon Banjo Bridge Company and invented machinery to automatically make them. That same year, he took out a patent on a tailpiece that allowed musicians to restring their instruments faster. In 1905, while still living in Hartford, Bacon applied for a patent for a new type of resonator for open-backed banjos. He was awarded the patent in June 1906, after he sold his Hartford house in April. Builders finished working on their house and barn in Forest Dale part of Brandon, Vermont in 1907. He moved into the home with his wife by 1907, calling it Stonehurst. In 1908 they bought a second, large place as an investment, that they intended to turn into a hotel. They began touring together as an act about 1910, having two Vermont homes for summer and winter. Bacon advertised his banjos in the July 1909 issue of Cadenza magazine, as the Bacon Mfg. and Pub. Co of Forestdale, Vermont. Although Bacon was contracting with Vega to make his early banjos, photos in a magazine article show th",

    "text": "Tartagal Spanish pronunciation: taɾtaˈɣal is a tropical city in northern Argentina, in the province of Salta. It is located in the northeast of the province, within the General José de San Martín Department, of which it is the capital. It is located in the Yungas jungle, at the foot of the sub-Andean mountain ranges to the west and the Salta plains to the east. This location gives it a wide variety of flora and fauna, and its territory is home to eight indigenous communities. It stands out for the large density of large trees in its streets and squares, such as mangoes, algarrobos and lapachos. It is one of the few places in the world where the green macaw is not extinct in the wild. Due to its economy, it is the third most important city in the province, after Orán. It stands out as a center for oil and gas extraction, and also has strong activity in the forestry and agricultural sectors. It is located 365 km from the provincial capital, Salta, 57 km from the border with Bolivia so it is considered a border city, 103 km from the border with Paraguay, and 1736 km from Buenos Aires. Tartagal is connected to the rest of the province and the country through National Route 34, National Route 86 and through the General Mosconi airport, although the latter does not receive commercial flights at present. Tartagal houses a regional headquarters of the National University of Salta and the Catholic University of Salta. It also has learning centers from the Siglo 21 and Blas Pascal universities.  History  Tartagal derives from the tártago plant Euphorbia lathyris, a kind of spurge. The area of modern Tartagal appears with this name in legal documents for the first time in 1853. At the time the area belonged to the Tarija Department, Bolivia. The foundation date of the town, however, is acknowledged as June 13, 1924; the municipality was created soon afterwards, and Tartagal attained city status only on September 22, 1949. The Argentine Army has the 17th Jungle Cazadores Company Compañía de Cazadores de Monte 17 based at Tartagal. At the beginning of the 20th century, important oil deposits were discovered which lead to the founding of Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales YPF. YPF was founded by Hipólito Yrigoyen in the 1922, and later privatized in 1992, was highly valued during the governmental terms of Juan Domingo Perón between the 40s and 50s. It was out-competing Standard Oil, in terms of production as well as in terms of social impact, since it ensured work, social security, education for the workers children and dozens of benefits that dignified the lives of workers, not counting the commercial flow that positively impacted the area. Petroleum was discovered here at the beginning of the 20th century. Since 1926 the state-owned oil company YPF employed or indirectly supported most of the local population. In 1992 the company was privatized becoming Repsol-YPF and 90 of its workers were fired, prompting violent social conflicts and, a few years later, the appearance of piquetero unemployed workers movements, similarly to what happened also in other oil-producing areas like Cutral-Co, Neuquén, and in the neighboring General Mosconi. On November 12, 1966, several sounding rockets were launched from Tartagal during a solar eclipse. On February 9, 2009, heavy rains caused the Tartagal River to break its banks and flood much of the city, resulting in 11 casualties.  Tourism   Social Composition  The social composition of Tartagal is characterized by its cultural diversity. There are seven aboriginal ethnic groups that reside in Tartagal: wichís or weenhayek, chiriguanos, chanés, quechuas, chorotes, chulupíes and Aymaras. Another important element of its social structure is the migratory component that is added to its population. Because of it is so close to Bolivia, a high percentage of its inhabitants are of Bolivian origin. Tartagal was the main destination of immigration of the peasant-livestock population of the east commonly known as Chaco that settled, like the Aboriginals, in neighborhoods surrounding the city. It also has important foreign communities including: Christian Levantines of Syrian-Lebanese origin, Greeks with a Cypriot branch, Irish people, Paraguayans and Spaniards.  Population  The last census, in the year 2010, the city of Tartagal had a population of 64,530 inhabitants, becoming the third most populated city of its province, surpassed only by the provincial capital and by San Ramón de la Nueva Orán.

    "text": "The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification PEFC is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization which promotes sustainable forest management through independent third-party certification. As of 2006, it was considered the certification system of choice for small forest owners in Europe. Its 48 endorsed national forest certification systems represent more than 280 million hectares 690106 acres of certified forests. This makes it the largest forest certification system in the world, covering about two-thirds of the globally certified forest area. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland.  History  The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification was created in 1999 by a group of European forest owners and managers, led by the Confederation of European Forest Owners CEPF, to meet the growing demand for certification, particularly in developing countries where the costs of certification could be prohibitive. The main goal of the organization, initially called the Pan-European Forest Certification Council, was to develop a certification system that was flexible and could be adapted to different forest types and management practices, while still meeting rigorous environmental, social, and economic standards. In 2000, PEFC made its first endorsements of the national standards used by Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Austria. In 2004 it endorsed its first non-European national standards, used by Australia and Chile. As a consequence PEFC changed its name from Pan European Forest Certification to Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes. In 2005 the forest surface certified against PEFC standards reached 100 million hectares after joining of Canada. In 2007 the forest surface certified against PEFC standards reached 200 million hectares. In 2009 the first tropical countries became members of PEFC: Gabon and Malaysia and as of 2015 40 national organizations were members of PEFC. In 2017 the forest surface certified against PEFC standards reached 300 million hectares and as of 2022 there were 55 national organizations members of PEFC. PEFCs certification standards are based on the principles of sustainable forest management, which include protecting biodiversity, ensuring the rights and welfare of forest workers and local communities, and promoting responsible forest management practices.  Sustainable forest management criteria  PEFC International is the only international forest certification scheme that bases its criteria on internationally accepted intergovernmental conventions and guidelines, thereby linking its sustainability benchmark criteria with existing governmental processes. This includes: Pan-European Criteria, Indicators and Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe ATOITTO Principles, criteria and indicators for the sustainable forest management of African natural tropical forests ATOITTO ITTO guidelines on sustainable forest management ITTO PEFC requires adherence to all eight core ILO conventions, even in countries which have not ratified them. These conventions are No 29: Forced Labour 1930 No 87: Freedom of Associations and Protection of the Right to Organise 1948 No 98: Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining 1949 No 100: Equal Remuneration 1951 No 105: Abolition of Forced Labour 1957 No 111: Discrimination Employment and Occupation 1958 No 138: Minimum Age for Admission to Employment 1973 No. 182: Worst Forms of Child Labour 1999  National forest certification systems  PEFC only recognizes forests certified to standards that have been reviewed and endorsed by PEFC. National forest certification systems that wish to be recognized by are required to set standards keeping with the requirements of ISOIEC Guide 59:1994 Code of good practice for standardization. National standards must be developed by so-called National Governing Bodies, and meet requirements for transparency, consultation and decision-making by consensus. These guidelines also outline processes for revising and amending standards, and provide those who utilise the standard with the security of future certainty.  Endorsements  All PEFC-endorsed standards have been subjected to public review during their development. National forest certification systems wanting to obtain PEFC endorsement are subject to an independent assessment to ensure that it meets the PEFC requirements for the standards development process, public review and forest management requirements. The consultants report is reviewed by an independent Panel of Experts and the PEFC Board, and if satisfactory, the new standard is approved by the PEFC members as a PEFC-endorsed standard. To ensure the independence of the certification bodies, they are not accredited by PEFC itself, but by a national accreditation agency. In line with its commitment to transparency, PEF",

The 312th Military Intelligence Battalion is stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Texas where it conducts all-source, signals intelligence, geospatial intelligence, open source intelligence, counterintelligence and human intelligence operations in support of US Army South and United States Southern Command requirements.  Unit history   23rd Signal Construction Battalion 1943-1953  The 312th Military Intelligence Battalion traces its origins to December 31, 1943, when it was constituted as the 23rd Signal Construction Battalion. Activated on February 10, 1944, at Camp Pickett, Virginia. It was redesignated the 23rd Signal Light Construction Battalion on Apr 24 and the 23rd Signal Heavy Construction Battalion Aug 21.  WWII 1945  The battalion deployed to the ChinaBurmaIndia Theater in WWII in April 1945 until 24 December 1945. The battalion sailed on the USS General LeRoy Eltinges maiden voyage on their way to Burma. The battalions primary mission was to construct and maintain vital communication lines along Ledo Road near Myitkyina, Burma. This included tasks such as laying telephone and telegraph lines, establishing communication centers, and ensuring reliable communication for military operations. The battalions work was crucial for coordinating troop movements, artillery support, and other critical aspects of combat operations. After its deployment, the unit returned to the United States and was inactivated at Fort Lawton, Washington, on January 22, 1946.  Korean War 1951-1953  During the Korean War, the battalion was redesignated as the 23rd Signal Construction Battalion on September 27, 1951, and activated in Korea on November 2 and assigned to the Eighth Army. The battalion was inactivated on May 15, 1953 in Korea. A company predecessor, Company B as the 191st Counter Intelligence Corps Detachment, was also activated in Korea in 1950 in support of the 1st Cavalry Division.  312th Communications Reconnaissance Battalion 1955-1956  On May 19, 1955 the battalion was converted to a signals intelligence unit and redesignated the 312th Communications Reconnaissance Battalion and assigned to the Army Security Agency ASA Europe Command coinciding with the commands relocation of Hq ASA Austria. The Battalion was organized with a Headquarters and Headquarters Company HHC and 4 Detachments along with some subordinate units. On June 25, The HHC was activated at the Bad Aibling Station in Germany along with Detachment A. Detachment B was located near Landshut, Germany. Detachment C was located at Weiden, Germany until its inactivation on April 1, 1956. Detachment D was activated February 17, in Campoformido, Italy. The 328th Communications Reconnaissance Company and its 7 Detachments, as well as the332d ASA Company and 22d ASA Detachment, fell under the battalions operational control. The primary mission of the battalion was to perform communications intelligence COMINT and communications security COMSEC functions directed by ASA, Europe.  312th Army Security Agency Battalion 1956-1957  The battalion was redesignated the 312th Army Security Agency Battalion on July 1, 1956. The battalion consisted of several detachments and subordinate units that carried over the previous designation including HHC, 328th and 332d ASA companies later the 180th and 181st USASA companies, Detachment A in Bad Aibling, Detachment D One in Verona, Italy that supported the Southern European Task Force SETAF, Detachment D Two in Udine, Italy, and Detachment L which was operated by the 332d ADA at a forward intercept site in Nottau, Germany. The battalion continued its mission to provide, operate, and control designated intercept facilities. The battalion was responsible for wo significant intelligence gathering missions. It gathered intelligence on the 1956 Poznań protests, and intelligence on Soviet Forces in Hungary SFH and the Hungarian Army during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The 312th ASA HHC was inactivated on October 15, 1957, at Bad Aibling Station in Germany and subordinate units were assigned to the 320th USASA Battalion taking over operations.  Vietnam War 1965-1972  In July 1965, two company predecessors, Company A as the 10th Radio Research Unit and the 371st Radio Research Company, and Company B as the 191st Military Intelligence Company, deployed to the Vietnam War with the 1st Cavalry Division Airmobile.  312th Military Intelligence Battalion Electronic Warfare Combat Provisional 1977-1981  On April 6, 1977, the 312th Military Intelligence Battalion EWC Provisional CEWI was organized.

    "text": "Katrin Juliet Cartlidge 15 May 1961  7 September 2002 was an English actress. She first appeared on screen as Lucy Collins in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside 19821983, before going on to win the 1997 Evening Standard Film Award for Best Actress for the Mike Leigh film Career Girls. Her other film appearances included Leighs Naked 1993, Before the Rain 1994, Breaking the Waves 1996, and From Hell 2001.  Early life  Cartlidge was born in London, to Derek, an English father and Bobbi, a German-Jewish refugee mother. She was educated at the Parliament Hill School for Girls in Camden.  Career  Cartlidges work in the Milcho Manchevski film Before the Rain 1994 and in No Mans Land 2001 made her well known in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkans. Her first leading role was playing Sophie in Mike Leighs Naked 1993. Cartlidge worked in two more Leigh films: in Career Girls 1997 she played one of the lead roles, Hannah, at the ages of both 20 and 30, and in Topsy Turvy 1999 she was a madam in a Paris brothel. She was due to play the lead role in Polish director Lech Majewskis 2004 film The Garden of Earthly Delightsthat of an art historian dying of cancerbut she left shortly before production began. Cartlidge won a role in 21 Grams but was replaced by Charlotte Gainsbourg due to her death. Cartlidge was also filming Dogville at the time of her death and was replaced by Patricia Clarkson.  Death and legacy  Cartlidge died at the age of 41 on 7 September 2002, of complications arising from pneumonia and septicaemia caused by a pheochromocytoma. The impact of Cartlidges sudden death saw the creation of the Katrin Cartlidge Foundation by the trustees Mike Leigh, Peter Gevisser, Simon McBurney, Chris Simon, and Cat Villiers. The patrons include Lars von Trier and Cartlidges sister Michelle. Established at the Sarajevo Film Festival, an annual bursary is awarded by an elected curator, chosen by the Foundation Trustees from a wide and eclectic number of Katrin Cartlidges friends and colleagues...to a new creative voice... While the new talent nominated each year will be a filmmaker, it is anticipated that the choices will be as varied and extraordinary as Katrins own choice of filmmakers and friends from across the arts. Mike Leigh wrote: She took to the improvisation and character work instantly, easily and with extraordinary commitment and imagination. Other than in the Royal Court Young Peoples Theatre, she had had no formal training, but you would never have guessed it. Drama Centre London turned her down, and that put her off. ... She often talked to me about a move into directing. I am in no doubt that we have lost not only one of our greatest actors but also one of the most interesting new directors of the future. Following her death, British singer Morrissey dedicated a performance of his song Late Night, Maudlin Street at the Royal Albert Hall to Cartlidge, describing her as a brilliant person and fantastic actor. Tracy Letts dedicated his 2003 play Man from Nebraska to Cartlidge, stating Man from Nebraska is dedicated to the memory of my dear friend Katrin Cartlidge.

    "text": "Kaliaganj is a community development block that forms an administrative division in Raiganj subdivision of Uttar Dinajpur district in the Indian state of West Bengal.  History  Historically the western frontier of ancient Pundravardhana kingdom, bordering ancient Anga of Mahabharat fame, the Dinajpur area remained somewhat obscure in the major empires that held sway over the region and beyond till the rise of the Dinajpur Raj during the Mughal period. Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the British in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the Permanent Settlement in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas police stations and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 196061, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district. In 1992, West Dinajpur district was bifurcated and Uttar Dinajpur district was established.  Geography  Kaliaganj is located at 2538N 8819E. Uttar Dinajpur district has a flat topography and slopes gently from north to south. All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger Barind Tract. The soil is composed of different varieties of alluvium. The main rivers are: Nagar, Mahananda, Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati Srimati and Tangon. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during monsoon, overflow the banks. The Tangon river flows through the upper portion of western part of Kaliaganj CD Block. The Chhiramati river touches the south-eastern edge of the CD Block and the Gamari river touches the south-western edge of Kaliaganj CD Block. Approximately 206 km of the India-Bangladesh border is in Uttar Dinajpur district. It covers the eastern boundary of the district. On the western side Uttar Dinajpur district has 227 km boundary with Bihar. Kaliaganj CD Block is bounded by Pirganj Upazila in Thakurgaon District and Bochaganj Upazila in Dinajpur district, both in Bangladesh, on the north, Biral Upazila in Dinajpur District of Bangladesh on the east, Kushmandi CD Block, in Dakshin Dinajpur, and Itahar CD Block on the south and Raiganj and Hemtabad CD Blocks on the west. Kaliaganj CD Block has an area of 301.90 km2. It has 1 panchayat samiti, 8 gram panchayats, 148 gram sansads village councils, 192 mouzas and 191 inhabited villages. Kaliaganj police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Kaliaganj. Uttar Dinajpur district is one of the smaller districts in the state and stands 15th in terms of area 3,140.00 km2 in the state. Gram panchayats of Kaliaganj block panchayat samiti are: Anantapur, Baruna, Bhandar, Bochadanga, Dhankoil, Malgaon, Mostafanagar and Radhikapur.

    "text": "Oldfieldthomasia is an extinct genus of notoungulate, probably related to the suborder Typotheria. It lived during the Middle Eocene, in what is today South America.  Description  This animal was approximately the size of a marmot, and probably superficially resembled a rodent. The 10 centimeters long skull was rather low and had an elongated muzzle; the orbits, of large dimension, were posteriorly opened and located in the posterior area of the skull. The zygomatic apophysis was rather slender. The posterior part of Oldfieldthomasia debilitata was closely studied by George Gaylord Simpson in 1936, through the realization of 55 very thin sections; the study highlighted numerous cranial characteristics, such as the relationships between the various cavities. The tympanic and hypotympanic cavities were not separated and were devoid of spongy tissue; the path of the pneumatic orifice can be followed between the epitympanic recess and the epitympanic sinus, filling free, and close to the size of tympanic cavity. The main sinuses of the veins and arteries were also visible : the carotid entered the tympanic cavity. As in all notoungulates, the cavity for the hyoid apophysis was quite large. The posterior jugular foramen and the median jugular foramen were notably external; the external portion of the first constituted the posterior carotid foramen. The mandible was long and thin. The teeth formed a continuous and progressive series, with a complete series of 22 low-crowned brachydont teeth, both in the maxilla and the mandible. The canines were incisor-shaped. The protocone and the hypocone were almost identical, with an oblique and elongated central dimple and a posterior dimple stopped by a sort of hook fused to the ectoloph. An anterior and a posterior cingulum were present; the molars had a mesostyle, while the premolars were triangular, with a fold on the metacone.  Classification  The genus Oldfieldthomasia was first described in 1901 by Florentino Ameghino, based on fossil remains found in terrains from the Middle Eocene of Argentina. Ameghino described several species, such as Oldfieldthomasia anfractuosa, O. debilitata, O. parvidens and O. traversa, but it may be possible that some of these forms represents intraspecific variations within a single species. Oldfieldthomasia is the eponymous genus of the family Oldfieldthomasiidae, a group of archaic notoungulates representative of the Eocene; this family, however, is considered paraphyletic by some researchers. Oldfieldthomasia may have been part of an early evolutionary radiation of the suborder Typotheria, a group of notoungulates who occupied during the Cenozoic various ecological niches comparable to those of rodents in other continents. Its closes relatives were Allalmeia, Colbertia and Dolichostylodon.  References and Bibliography  F. Ameghino. 1901.

    "text": "In quantum mechanics, a doublet is a composite quantum state of a system with an effective spin of  1  2 , such that there are two allowed values of the spin component,   1  2  and   1  2 . Quantum systems with two possible states are sometimes called two-level systems. Essentially all occurrences of doublets in nature arise from rotational symmetry. Spin  1  2  is associated with the fundamental representation of the Lie group SU2.  History and applications  The term doublet dates back to the early 19th century, when it was observed that certain spectral lines of an ionized, excited gas would split into two under the influence of a strong magnetic field, in an effect known as the anomalous Zeeman effect. Such spectral lines were observed not only in the laboratory, but also in astronomical spectroscopy observations, allowing astronomers to deduce the existence of, and measure the strength of magnetic fields around the Sun, stars and galaxies. Conversely, it was the observation of doublets in spectroscopy that allowed physicists to deduce that the electron had a spin, and that furthermore, the magnitude of the spin had to be  1  2 . See the history section of the article on spin physics for greater detail. Doublets continue to play an important role in physics. For example, the healthcare technology of magnetic resonance imaging is based on nuclear magnetic resonance. In this technology, a spectroscopic doublet occurs in a spin  1  2  atomic nucleus, whose doublet splitting is in the radio-frequency range. By applying both a magnetic field and carefully tuning a radio-frequency transmitter, the nuclear spins will flip and re-emit radiation, in an effect known as the Rabi cycle. The strength and frequency of the emitted radio waves allow the concentration of such nuclei to be measured. Another potential application is the use of doublets as the emitting layer in light-emitting diodes LEDs. These materials have the advantage of having 100 theoretical quantum efficiency based on spin statistics whereas singlet systems and triplet systems have significantly lower efficiencies or rely on noble metals, such as platinum and iridium, to emit light.

    "text": "On The Red Carpet OTRC is an American syndicated show which carries celebrity news, Hollywood events and features about celebrity style produced by ABC Owned Television Stations for KABC-TV and DisneyABC Domestic Television.  History  On the Red Carpet was originally launched in 2002 as an effort by KABC to brand their local coverage of the Academy Awards leading into the national coverage from ABC. They decided to continue the site and build the traffic. On March 14, 2010, the Sunday after the Academy Awards, On the Red Carpet was launched as a weekly series for KABC. Seven other ABC Owned Television Stations soon carried the show, with San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV San Diego also following. The show began to be carried by the national digital subchannel, the Live Well Network, also owned by AOTS, in the fall of 2010, with the addition of Chris Balish, as co-host. Balish left the show in 2012. The series produced their live Oscar special in 2012, which featured the college journalist winners of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencess Red Carpet Journalist Contest assisting in the interviews. The show moved from the Live Well Network to national syndication on September 14, 2013 with a return to a single host, mainly on ABC affiliates and usually airing on Saturday or Sunday afternoons against sports on other networks. On June 27, 2014, the OTRC.com website was shut down with the show using social media instead for content releases. The syndicated program ended production with their September 13, 2014 edition, but the On the Red Carpet banner will remain for KABCs Oscars coverage in the future. In recent years, OTRC has expanded to include coverage of other awards shows and film festivals.  Format  In its form, On The Red Carpet aired for half an hour every Sunday evening at 6:30 p.m. on KABC and is designed as a weekend slotted show with stations scheduling it in the access hour and late-fringe time-slots. The series was sold on an all-barter basis to stations with the ad split, 4 minutes local and three three-and-a-half minutes national per episode. It was hosted by Miss USA 2007 winner Rachel Smith and produced by KABC-TVs news department. The episodes are shot on location instead of in studio. The show is composed of celebrity news, exclusive set visits, first looks at upcoming film and television projects, and one-on-one interviews with Hollywood talents and celebrities.  References",

    "text": "Marie Louise Andrews née, Newland; October 31, 1849  February 7, 1891 was an American author and editor from Indiana. She was a founder of the Western Association of Writers, and served as its secretary from its founding until June 1888, when she retired. She was prolific in both verse and prose, but she never published her works in book form, and little of her work has been preserved.  Early life and education  Mary later Marie Louise Newland was born in Bedford, Indiana, on October 31, 1849. She was the second daughter of Dr. Benjamin Franklin Newland 18211889 and Louisa Ann Curry Newland, who were educated and considered to be intellectuals. Her early life was spent in Bedford, where she was mainly educated in private schools. She was a student at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, in St. Agnes Hall, Terre Haute, Indiana, and at Hungerford Collegiate Institute, Adams, New York, which was destroyed by fire shortly before commencement, so that Andrews was not formally graduated. Andrews spoke French and German, and was familiar with Latin and modern language literature.  Career  In the winter of 188586, while working as an editor at the Indianapolis Herald, Andrews and other contributors to the paper, including John C. Ochiltree, Dr. James Newton Matthews, Richard Lew Dawson, and Dr. Henry William Taylor, became the founders of the Western Association of Writers movement, discussing the idea of a writers association publicly through the Heralds columns. Andrews, a co-founder of the association, served as its secretary from its organization until June, 1888, when she retired from the office. Among her acquaintances were many of the prominent writers of the Western United States, and at the annual conventions of the association, she was always a conspicuous member. She was also remembered as a brilliant conversationalist and an effective impromptu speaker. The Western Association of Writers owed its organization and establishment largely to Andrews indefatigable efforts. Andrews was not an author in the technical sense of having written a book, yet she gained a well-merited reputation as a ready and versatile writer of poems, essays, and sketches, contributing to various periodical publications. Her interest in literary work was much broader than a purely personal matter. The development of western literature, and its recognition by the country and the world at large, had been on her mind for some time before she was given the opportunity to demonstrate the practicability of her ideas in the association with which her name was closely identified. She foresaw the growth of literature in the west, and her ideas regarding that growth and of the best means of fostering it were embodied in the association. It served as a means of introducing scores of talented writers to the public. She was one of the most active promoters of the organization in its inception, and was one of its most steadfast friends through the years when its continuance seemed questionable.  Personal life  On May 15, 1875, she married Albert M. Andrews, then of North Vernon, Indiana. Soon afterwards, they moved to Connersville, Indiana where he worked in the pharmaceutical business. She was in Indianapolis for several winters, supervising the education of her son, Albert Charlton Andrews, who was her only child. Marie Louise Andrews died at Connersville on February 7, 1891.

    "text": "The Oriental greenfinch Chloris sinica, also known as the grey-capped greenfinch, is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae that breeds in broadleaf and conifer woodlands of the East Palearctic.  Taxonomy  In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Oriental greenfinch in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in China. He used the French name Le pinçon de la Chine and the Latin Fringilla sinencis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the oriental greenfinch. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Fringilla sinica and cited Brissons work. The type locality was subsequently restricted to Macau in eastern China. The specific name sinica is Medieval Latin for Chinese. The greenfinches were later placed in the genus Carduelis but when molecular phylogenetic studies found that they were not closely related to the other species in Carduelis, the greenfinches were moved to the resurrected genus Chloris. The genus had been introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800. The word Chloris is from the Ancient Greek khlōris for a European greenfinch; the specific epithet sinica is Mediaeval Latin for Chinese. Five subspecies are now recognised: C. s. ussuriensis Hartert, 1903  Eastern Manchuria to South Ussuriland and Korea C. s. kawarahiba Temminck, 1836  Kamchatka Peninsula, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin and Hokkaido, KoreaUlleung Island, winters to Japan C. s. minor Temminck  Schlegel, 1848  South Japan Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu and Korea Cheju-Do Island C. s. sinica Linnaeus, 1766  Western China Gansu to South Manchuria C. s. chabarowi Stegmann, BK 1929  Inner Mongolia to North Manchuria The Bonin greenfinch from the Bonin Islands including Iwo Jima, formerly C. s. kittlitzi, is nowadays usually considered a distinct species.  Description  The Oriental greenfinch is a medium-sized finch 12.5 to 14 cm 4.9 to 5.5 in in length, with a strong bill and a short slightly forked tail. It nests in trees or bushes, laying 35 eggs.

History  The album was produced by Duke Ellington with financial support from Frank Sinatra. Powell played the tune Satin Doll by ear after Ellington sang it to him during the session. Alternates and outtakes from the session were released by Mythic Sound on Earl Bud Powell, Vol. 6: Writin for Duke, 63.  Reception  In a review for AllMusic, Ron Wynn noted Powells uneven but often astonishing piano work, and wrote: the vast majority of selections are performed with flair and conviction. Writer Ira Gitler commented: this album stands far above the painful Victors and Verves of the 19541956 period and is more like early Powell than the Blue Notes of the late fifties. A writer for Billboard stated that Powell plays smoothly and most brightly, and is capable of conveying the subtlest of jazz moods.

Buck died in the Civil War in 1865, aged 24 or 25, while fighting for the Union Army. In 1860, Holt designed the Central Parish Church in Yarmouth, Maine, which still stands on the towns Main Street, at the head of Portland Street, and is now on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of only four surviving examples of his work on churches in Maine. Between 1871 and 1876, he served as chief engineer of the Maine Central Railroad, for whom he designed bridges and buildings, in addition to undertaking surveys for potential new lines. In 1876, he moved to California, where he continued in architecture but also branched into mining and lumbering.

    "text": "South River is located in the community of South River in Ontario as a railway station. The station was originally constructed by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, a subsidiary of the Northern and Northwestern Railway, in 1884. It was subsequently owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway 1888 - 1919 and Canadian National Railways 1919 - 1986. It was a significant station stop along the historic route connecting Toronto to North Bay, and the Canadian Pacific Railway 1885. Transcontinental trains traveling between Toronto and Vancouver once frequented the station. It is likely the oldest wooden railway station in north-eastern Ontario. It is now a community heritage building in the town of South River.  History  The Northern Railway of Canada had reached Gravenhurst by 1875, which was its northernmost terminal at the time. The section between Barrie and Gravenhurst was initially built by the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway, circa 1870, before being acquired by the Northern Railway in 1875. The Northern and Northwestern railway network consisted of the former Northern Railway of Canada, and Hamilton and Northwestern Railway, which merged in 1879. Due to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Mattawa valley, and along the north shore of Lake Nipissing beginning in the summer of 1881, the Toronto-based Northern and Northwestern wished to provide a direct connection to the new C.P.R. transcontinental line that would ensure Torontos economic involvement. A new company was formed, the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway which was then leased to and operated by the parent Northern and Northwestern Railway, circa 1883. The new line was to extend the existing railhead at Gravenhurst to the C.P.R. mainline at the La Vase River, just east of Lake Nipissing. This location was subsequently named Nipissing Junction. The line was referred to as The Callander Extension at the time, as the village of Callander was the closest existing establishment to the junction point. Construction began in 1884 and was finished in 1886. Regular-schedule, revenue service commenced in the spring of 1887. One year later in 1888, the Grand Trunk Railway bought out the Northern and Northwestern Railway, including the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. From that time on, until the insolvency of the G.T.R. circa 1918-1919 the line was owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway. From that time until the present day, the line has been owned and operated by Canadian National Railways. The South River Station is one of the first generation, original wooden stations built by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. It is also the last surviving station originally built along the line, all of the others having been demolished or replaced. This ranks it among the oldest railway stations in northern Ontario, and likely the oldest wooden station still existing in the region. The South River station was built on the east side of the mainline and situated between Ottawa Avenue and Montreal Avenue. It featured a hip roof over the operators bay, and two gable dormers over the freightexpress section. It was later moved by the Grand Trunk to the west side of the mainline, opposite to its original location, likely around 1907-1908 Requires confirmation. At this time, a new operators bay was constructed and finished with a new gable roof to face the mainline. The freightexpress section was also altered with the addition of one shed-roof dormer, which was also added to face the mainline. The station featured a combination of painted wood siding finishes: tongue and groove infill along the base course, doors, and soffit; and board and batten in the mid and upper courses. The original roof was cedar shingle. Heating was provided by pot-belly stoves using wood andor coal. Initial interior and exterior platform lighting was provided by kerosene lanterns. While the original Northern and Pacific Junction Railway paint scheme is unknown, the standard Grand Trunk Railway paint scheme of hunter green, burgundy and yellow cream was used thereafter. Sometime in the post-war era after 1945 a gray asphalt siding product Insulbrick was applied by Canadian National Railways over the wall sections. Asphalt roll and shingles later replaced the initial use of cedar shingles. Consistent with the treatment of their historic railway stations, Canadian National Railways made numerous unsympathetic alterations to the building over the years, diminishing its original architectural elements and finishes. General neglect and lack of investment in these types of stations rendered most of them beyond repair, in which case they were demolished or left to decay. The community of South River, however, established a restoration group which has overseen a concerted effort to save and re-establish the original paint scheme and wood finishes of the structure. Restoration work on the station was undertaken in th",

    "text": "St. Michael is a Lutheran chapel on a hill near Kaubenheim, part of Ipsheim, Bavaria, Germany. The building is named after Michael the Archangel. The building is also called Bergkirche Mountain church for its prominent location. The chapel had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1687. It is a listed monument, where services are held in summer and for Christmas.  History  The chapel probably began as a cemetery chapel in the 11th or 12th century on a hill near Kaubenheim, because swampy grounds in the valley did not permit burials. The building is named after Michael the Archangel, who is considered to be the guardian of the Christian church. The chapel is documented first by Lutheran church records Kirchenbücher in 1533. In the present building, only interior features in the tower date back to the medieval chapel, which was damaged by fire caused by lightning on 21 March 1687. The building was restored from 1695 to 1702, with the nave completed in 1696. Interior features were installed until 1717. The pulpit was bought around 1699, probably from the parish in Ipsheim. Christoph Rösler created 18 paintings on canvas in 1701 and 1702. They depict Biblical topics and were installed at the balustrade of the balcony. A third bell was acquired with a donation from Martin Dennler, the school master, in 1745. At the same time, a new organ was built. The interior was remodelled in 1862. The chapel was equipped with electricity around 1980. The interior was restored between 1986 and 1988, and the exterior from 2014 to 2016. The building is a listed monument. Services are usually held from Easter to Kirchweihe in October, and for Christmas and New Years Eve.

    "text": "Macandrew Bay Māori: Te Roto Pāteke is located on the Otago Peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand. It is situated on the edge of Otago Harbour, and is named for pioneer Scottish settler James Macandrew who lived here during his later life. The Te Reo Māori name for the bay, Te Roto Pāteke, refers to the Brown teal Māori: Pāteke formerly prevalent in the area. Early European residents of the area called the bay The Hundreds, due to the large number of boulders which covered the foreshore. Macandrew Bay is a suburb of Dunedin, but has the feel of an isolated coastal settlement and is often regarded as a separate township, even though the heart of the city is visible 10 kilometres away at the head of the harbour. It is both a commuter and a harbourside retreat from the city. The settlement centres on an area around the junction of Portobello Road and Greenacres Street, the latter a narrow road which rises steeply towards the interior of the Peninsula. Greenacres Street roughly follows the valley of the small Rodgers Creek. The community hall lies on the lower part of Greenacres Street close to its junction with Portobello Road, and the settlements few shops lie immediately to the southwest of the junction. Behind these shops lie the communitys primary school and cemetery, the latter of which includes the grave of James Macandrew. The bay has a small beach opposite the shops, which is well-used by the public. The beach was created artificially, with sand brought to the bay from the nearby Pacific coast. The area around the beach has been turned into a small public park, and landscaping of this was completed in 1979. Macandrew Bay is the largest of several settlements which lie on the harbour coast of Otago Peninsula. Between it and Dunedin lies Glenfalloch, a private gardens open to the public. Beyond Macandrew Bay to the northeast lie Company Bay and Raynbirds Bay and to the southwest is Colinswood, the latter named for James Macandrews house. These small settlements could be considered suburbs of the Macandrew Bay. Beyond Raynbirds Bay lie Broad Bay and Portobello. These settlements are connected to each other and to Dunedins city centre by Portobello Road, a winding road which runs along the harbour coast of the peninsula, and by the Otago Harbour Cycleway, which runs alongside it Both the road and the sea wall which lies along the harbour edge were constructed by prison labour in the 1860s. A second route, Castlewood Road, rises from Company Bay to meet with Highcliff Road, which runs along the ridge of the peninsula from Dunedin to Portobello. Castlewood Road also connects with Camp Road, which leads to the stately home Larnach Castle, situated above Broad Bay.

    "text": "Louis Ortiz also known as Bronx Obama is an American impressionist of Barack Obama. A former field technician for Verizon, Ortiz is the subject of Bronx Obama, a Kickstarter-financed documentary produced and directed by Ryan Murdock. He also played several background characters in the Star Trek franchise, notably Ensign Culhane in Star Trek Voyager; he also has one credited appearance in Star Trek as a Klingon warrior.  Career beginnings  In August 2008, Ortiz was unemployed, collecting workers compensation, and playing in pool tournaments for money. Friends jokingly told Ortiz that his picture was on the front page of the New York Daily News. When Ortiz looked at the newspaper he failed to see the resemblance. Ortiz went to play pool at the Williamsbridge Tavern in the Bronx when Pat, his friend and bartender, noted the similarity to Obama. Ortiz, who had facial hair, still couldnt picture the similarity. While many people commented to Ortiz about his likeness to Obama, Pat was the first to mention and encourage Ortiz to use the likeness as a financial opportunity. Ortiz, who was unemployed for a year and in desperate need of money, was intrigued by the possibilities. He shaved his facial hair, and was dumbfounded by the similarity. Pat, who had some experience in modeling, helped Ortiz develop a plan to capitalize on his likeness to the Democratic presidential nominee. Ortiz managed to gather enough money for head shots and a new suit. With the help from friends at the bar, he contacted agents and sent resumes and head shots. He practiced his impersonation in the mirror for several weeks then decided it was time to make his first public appearance. September 21, 2008 was the date of the last game to be played at the old Yankee Stadium. Ortiz, costumed in his suit, ascended into the bleachers with several friends, many of whom were retired policemen who pretended they were escorting the actual Barack Obama. Ortiz said it wasnt long before he drew attention from the crowd and grabbed the attention of the audience.  Career highlights  Ortiz contracted with a talent agency, William Gold Entertainment, that has increased his status. He was also on an episode of This American Life. He had a New York Times feature and a segment on The Jeff Probst Show on the CBS television channel. He also appeared in the Japanese feature film Saraba Itoshi no Daitouryou Good Bye Dear President. He has done commercials for Netherland-based Rabobank, South Korean satellite television provider, Skylife, and appeared in a Times Square billboard campaign for the car manufacturer, Hyundai. Ortiz has been a guest star in myISHs The Hillywood Show, The Onion, MTVs Matts Apartment, Four Shaw Entertainments Tomorrow: The Film, and Australian web series, The Nobel Funk Off. Ortizs career as an Obama impersonator was the subject of the 2014 documentary film Bronx Obama by Ryan Murdock. The film was developed under the name The Audacity of Louis Ortiz; however, the film was re-titled before its release.  References",

    "text": "Bruce Wayne Campbell December 14, 1946  August 3, 1983, known by his stage name Jobriath, was an American rock musician and actor. He was the first openly gay rock musician to be signed to a major record label and one of the first internationally famous musicians to die of AIDS.  Biography   Early life and career  Born Bruce Wayne Campbell in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Jobriath showed early musical talent for playing the piano, and soon played organ in his local church. It was during this time his talents led him to being introduced to Eugene Ormandy as a child prodigy. While he was a high school student, he became further interested in classical music, and favored composers such as Sergei Prokofiev. He wrote the first two movements of his first symphony by his senior year in high school, but for reasons unknown chose not to complete it. After graduating from Upper Merion High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1964, Jobriath took an interest in folk music, partly inspired by seeing Peter, Paul and Mary in concert several times. He briefly formed a folk group with the help of his music teacher who arranged for identical twins Marty and Grace to join him. As a trio they named themselves The Last Three, and played several regional shows in the PA area before Marty and Grace departed for college. While Jobriath attended Temple University for one semester in the music program, he soon dropped out. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in the mid-1960s and went AWOL within months. Renaming himself Jobriath Salisbury, he relocated to Los Angeles.  Casting in Hair and early recordings with Pidgeon  After accompanying a friend to the audition for the musical Hair as a piano player, he impressed the producer and director with his singing and talents on the piano. He was soon cast by the director Tom OHorgan into the leading role of Woof, a character implied to be gay. He appeared in the legendary West Coast production at the Aquarius Theater on Sunset Boulevard. Despite receiving positive reviews for his performances, he was fired from the production for upstaging the other actors. After leaving the production in 1969, he joined the folk-rock band Pidgeon, which was then signed to Decca Records, as their lead singer, pianist and guitarist. The band recorded a debut album originally titled First Flight From the Forest which was re-titled by their label as the self-titled Pidgeon, andshortly after the albums releasethe band released the single Rubber Bricks bw Prison Walls before disbanding. Both were produced by Stan Farber. At this time he was traced by the Military Police and arrested, spending nearly six months in a military psychiatric hospital after suffering a breakdown. During this period he began writing the songs that would lead to his next musical incarnation.  Jerry Brandt, the hype and Jobriath Boone  In mid-December 1972, Jerry Brandt, Carly Simons former manager, overheard a demo tape being played by Clive Davis at Columbia Records. Davis rejected the tape as mad, unstructured and destructive to melody, but Brandt was quick to step in. Jobriath later remarked that coming from a man who discovered both Patti Smith and Barry Manilow...so much for sanity and structure! Brandt located Jobriath in California, where he was living in an unfurnished apartment and working as a prostitute. Brandt: In walked this beautiful creature dressed in white. I said, Why dont you come out to Malibu and hang out? This became a feature of the mythology used to promote Jobriath, and helps to explain the acrimony that followed the dissolution of their professional and personal relationship. Brandt signed Jobriath, now calling himself Jobriath Boone, to Elektra Records for a reported 500,000, in what was allegedly the most lucrative recording contract of its time. Jobriath was signed to a two-album deal. A huge marketing campaign and media blitz ensued, including full-page advertisements in Vogue, Penthouse, and Rolling Stone magazines, full-length posters on over 250 New York City buses and a huge 41 ft 12 m by 43 ft 13 m billboard in Times Square. All featured the forthcoming debut album sleeve design by noted photographer Shig Ikeda, which featured a nude Jobriath, made to resemble an ancient Roman statue. Plans were announced for a lavish three night live debut at the Paris Opera that December, at a cost of 200,000 and a subsequent tour of European opera houses. Jobriath informed the press that the show would feature him dressed as King Kong being projected upwards on a mini Empire State Building. This will turn into a giant spurting penis and I will have transformed into Marlene Dietrich. Elektra, concerned about spiraling production costs, postponed the Paris Opera shows until February, later canceling them due to expense. Amidst this barrage of promotion, the debut album Jobriath was released on June 15, 1973, garnering mostly positive reviews. Rolli",

    "text": "Revelation 19 is the nineteenth chapter of the Book of Revelation or the Apocalypse of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The book is traditionally attributed to John the Apostle, but the precise identity of the author remains a point of academic debate. In this chapter, heaven exults over the fall of Babylon the Great.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 21 verses.  Textual witnesses  Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: Codex Sinaiticus 330-360 Codex Alexandrinus 400-440 Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus ca. 450; extant verses 1-4  Old Testament references  Revelation 19:15: Psalm 2:89  New Testament references  Revelation 19:9: Matthew 22:1 Revelation 19:10: Revelation 22:9 Revelation 19:15: Revelation 2:26,27; 12:5 Revelation 19:16: Revelation 17:14  Structure  In the Jerusalem Bible, verses 1 to 10 conclude the section in chapters 17 and 18 dealing with the Punishment of Babylon, and verses 11 to 21 concern the first battle of the End.  The Fall of Babylon 19:18   Verse 1  After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God! A full range of voices in heaven give praise to God for his judgment of Babylon.  John and the Angel 19:910   Verse 9  Then he said to me, Write: Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb! And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God. In place of he said, many English translations infer that the speaker is an angel, because in verse 10 he forgoes being worshipped and calls himself your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges assumes that this angel and the one who came forward in Revelation 17:1 are the same.  The Rider from Heaven and his Victory 19:1121   Verse 11  Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. According to the Jerusalem Bible, the white horse symbolises victory. According to Methodist writer Joseph Benson, it was intended to denote Jesus justice and holiness, and also that victory and triumph should mark his progress. The horse may be contrasted with the colt or ass on which Jesus rode into Jerusalem Matthew 21:17 etc. and the biblical prophecy underpinning the gospel accounts Zechariah 9:9. The ass is for peace, but the horse was used for war.  Verse 12  His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.  Verse 13  He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. The person of Jesus, as the truth and the one who has supremely witnessed to the truth of God in his life and his death, comes to earth and is the Word of God in person.  Verse 15  Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. Sharp or sharp two-edged.  Uses   Literature  M. R. James 1904 short story The Treasure of Abbot Thomas quotes from Revelation 19:16 and 19:12 to give the text They have on their raiment a writing which no man knoweth: a clue to the hidden location of the titular treasure.

    "text": "The Marquisate of Fosdinovo was a small fiefdom, led by a Marquess, that existed in the Italian peninsula between 1355 and 1797. It was based around Fosdinovo, a city east of La Spezia, and was ruled by the Malaspinas, a prominent Italian family, throughout its existence.  Founding of the Marquisate  The Marquisate of Fosdinovo was established around 1355 when Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg visited the area and granted the rank of Marquisate to Galeotto I Malaspina. The area Galeotto I took control of had been owned by the Bishops of Luni and had been occupied by Lucca not long before this. In 1393, Galetto I died, and his sons split the Marquisate into small territories for themselves. Under Gabriele II 1467 - 1508, the Marquisate developed and expanded significantly. in 1468, an oratory was built, followed by several other religious buildings in the next few decades.  End of the Marquisate  Carlo Emanuele became the ruler of the Marquisate in 1759, thirty years before the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars began. Eventually, the fiefdom was occupied by the Republic of France. With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars and the establishment of the Congress of Vienna, Fosdinovo was put under the control of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. Towards the end of the 19th century, descendants of the Marquises that formerly ruled over the country regained possession of the towns castle. They still own it to this day.

It occupied a growing industrial base by the railway station, Salfords, on the Brighton Main Line from London and men in its workforce founded the club on an informal basis before World War II. The patent-based technical printing business with a large library of type faces was known variously under brand names Monotype or Monotype Typography. The club qualified and contributed as one of the founding clubs of the Surrey Premier League in 1982. The business was divided up in 1992: the hardware sold to IPA Group; the type department, having produced the TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1 with Microsoft, continued as Monotype Typography, integrated into the Agfa part of Monotypes parent business in 1998. Its typefaces included Albion, Goudy Old Style and Times New Roman.

    "text": "The United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS is a non-profit scientific and educational organization that administers the only Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network OPTN in the United States, established under the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 by Gene A. Pierce, founder of United Network for Organ Sharing. Located in Richmond, Virginia, the organizations headquarters are situated near the intersection of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64 in the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park.  Activities  United Network for Organ Sharing is involved in many aspects of the organ transplant and donation process: Managing the national transplant waiting list, matching donors to recipients. Maintaining the database that contains all organ transplant data for every transplant event that occurs in the U.S. Bringing together members to develop policies that make the best use of the limited supply of organs and give all patients a fair chance at receiving the organ they need, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, religion, lifestyle, or financialsocial status. Monitoring every organ match to ensure organ allocation policies are followed. Providing assistance to patients, family members and friends. Educating transplant professionals about their important role in the donation and transplant processes. Educating the public about the importance of organ donation.  History  United Network for Organ Sharing was awarded the initial Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network contract on September 30, 1986, and it is the only organization to ever manage the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. United Network for Organ Sharing provides the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network with a functional, effective management system incorporating the Board of Directors, committees and regional membership to operate OPTN elements and activities. In late December 2013, it was announced that United Network for Organ Sharing had developed new policies and regulations governing the new field of hand and face transplants like it does standard organ transplants, giving more Americans who are disfigured by injury or illness a chance at reconstruction. In July 2014, government regulations went into effect making hand and face transplants subject to the same oversight by United Network for Organ Sharing as heart or kidney transplants. The rules mean potential transplant recipients will be added to the United Network for Organ Sharing network, for matching of donated hands and face tissue to ensure correct tissue type and compatibility for skin color, size, gender and age. Transplants and their outcomes will be tracked. In 2020, the Senate Finance Committee launched a bipartisan investigation into UNOS, seeking information into various abuses and patient harms. In 2022, the committee published a bipartisan report concluding that From the top down, the U.S. transplant network is not working, putting Americans lives at risk.. UNOS has also come under intense scrutiny for issues related to outdated and insecure technology, as well as failing to address fatal patient safety risks and anti-patient misinformation. An investigation by the United States Senate Committee on Finance published in August 2022 catalogs over a thousand complaints from the previous decade, including patient deaths and injuries caused by failures to check for disease and match blood type. At an oversight hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out that UNOS is 15 times more likely to lose or damage an organ in transit as an airline is to lose or damage your luggage. Temperature regulation during transport can also be problematic.  Regions  United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network operate by grouping states into several different regions throughout the country. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Eastern Vermont Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the part of Northern Virginia in the Donation Service Area served by the Washington Regional Transplant Community DCTC Organ procurement organization Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Puerto Rico Oklahoma and Texas Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wyoming New York and Western Vermont Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and most of Virginia  Allocation  United Network for Organ Sharing uses a set policy to remove as much subjectivity as possible from the process of matching organs with recipients referred to as a match run. There are several factors that are involved, including, but not limited to: Age Ability of the patient to recover ABO though very young recipients are often considered for",

It is 970 metres 3,180 ft long and has a vertical range of 33 metres 108 ft. The entrance is normally dry, but in flood it becomes an impressive resurgence. Its name derives from the north country word for badger. It consists of three main passages. From the entrance a stooping height passage heading south-east reaches a large 6 metres 20 ft deep pool after 330 metres 1,080 ft from which a stream emerges. This flows down a low passage to the north for some 270 metres 890 ft where a sump is reached. The third main passage continues south underwater from the pool for 225 metres 738 ft at a depth of 27 metres 89 ft where it reaches a junction and becomes too restricted. The cave is formed in Carboniferous limestone, and is thought to drain the Great Asby Scar area 3 kilometres 1.9 mi to the south-west. The resurgence is presumed to be St. Thomass Well in Great Asby. The main part of the cave has been known for a long time, and it was an object of curiosity in the nineteenth century. A brief foray into it was described in The Gentlemans Magazine in 1791, and a description appeared in The Monthly Magazine in 1802. The first full description complete with passage lengths appeared in 1813. The first account of an exploration by cavers was in 1941 by members of the Yorkshire Ramblers Club, and in November 1946 it was surveyed by a group from Appleby Grammar School led by Brian Price. The upstream sump was first dived for about 10 metres 33 ft to a descending rift in 1960 by members of the Cave Diving Group, at which time the main part of the cave was re-surveyed by Warburton et alia. Further exploration took place in 1975-1976 by members of the same group to reach the current limit.  References",

She tells him her name is Isabella and that she is an exchange student staying there while the Cusamanos are away. Tony takes her out to lunch and she describes the beauty of Avellino, where Tonys grandfather came from. He has a daydream about Isabella in a rocking chair in a village house, nursing a baby named Antonio. One day, Isabella is no longer there. When the Cusamanos return, Tony asks about her and realizes he has been hallucinating. Dr. Melfi instructs him to stop taking lithium and theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure. Mikey, acting through Donnie Paduana, contracts two gunmen to carry out the hit on Tony. Uncle Junior cannot bear to hear the details of the plan when Mikey tries to report. Meanwhile, Christopher is concerned about Tonys emotional state and secretly follows him; he unknowingly prevents the hit when he pulls his car up next to the assassins, blocking their view of Tony. Mikey and Donnie urgently meet about the failed attempt, with Junior hiding in the backseat of Mikeys car. Donnie promises to try the hit again the next day and casually remarks that even Tonys mother wants him dead. Junior, fearing Donnies big mouth, has Mikey kill him. The next day, the assassins make their move while Tony is running errands, only for one hitman to accidentally kill the other. After a ferocious struggle, Tony leaves the other gunman on the street and drives away, but crashes into a parked car. At the hospital, Tony says that his injuries occurred in an attempted carjacking, a story that not even A.J. believes. FBI Agent Harris comes to his bed and offers a deal, including immunity from prosecution, which Tony scornfully rejects. The next day, Livia and Junior visit Tony at home. Livia appears not to know who Meadow is; Junior later comments on the good timing of this apparent memory loss.  Reception  Alan Sepinwall has lauded Isabella as one of the greatest episodes of The Sopranos.

    "text": "Drew: The Man Behind the Poster is a 2013 American documentary film about the career of film poster artist Drew Struzan. It is directed by Erik Sharkey and premiered on July 19, 2013 at San Diego Comic-Con.  Synopsis  The documentary features interviews with a number of people, including Struzan himself, his wife, Dylan Struzan, his son, Christian Struzan, directors Steven Spielberg, Guillermo del Toro and George Lucas, and actors Harrison Ford and Michael J. Fox. The film follows Struzans career painting movie posters for films such as Star Wars, The Thing, Back to the Future, the Indiana Jones franchise, and the Harry Potter franchise. The film delves into Struzans art for Alice Coopers album Welcome to My Nightmare, and also how his artwork for Guillermo del Toros Hellboy, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, and Pans Labyrinth, though greatly admired by del Toro, was rejected by the studio in favor of more photographic posters. This leads the documentary in a direction about how film studios are interested more in profit rather than quality, how film posters are more often photographs of the actors rather than paintings of them. The documentary concludes with footage of Struzan at San Diego Comic-Con in 2010, wherein he receives the Inkpot Award for his illustrations. This is then followed by footage of Struzan talking about and showing his personal paintings not related to film, and how he spends his time painting not for someone else, but for himself, and how he often plays outside with grandson, Nico.  Critical reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44 based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 5.810. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews. Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film becomes a mildly taxing torrent. And Mr. Struzan, while an agreeable presence, is not an especially engrossing speaker. Peter Debruge of Variety called the documentary sophomore effort that is no masterpiece, although noting that he owned a Struzan poster himself and admired Struzans impressive oeuvre. Nick Schager of The A.V. Club appreciated that the documentary makes a valid case for the artist as not simply an all-time great, but as a casualty of a business that prizes bottom-line cost management above unique creativity; however, he disliked the films focus on lavishing adulation on Struzan.

    "text": "Veerateeswarar Temple also called Vazhuvur Veerateeswarar temple is a Hindu temple located at Vazhuvur in Mayiladuthurai district of Tamil Nadu, India. The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Bala Gujambigai. The village is mentioned in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Vaippu Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished the elephant taking the form of Gajasamhara. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty during the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam.  Legend  According to Hindu mythology, once, some sages doubting the omnipotence of the god Shiva created an elephant and challenged the god to a duel. Shiva took the form of Gajasamharamurti or slayer of the elephant and killed the elephant and wore its skin as a garment. As per another version, the sages residing in Tharukavana wanted Shiva to repent for his act of coming as Bhikshatana and inducing their wives to get them into conjugal mood. They created an elephant to fight against Shiva. Shiva tore open the elephant, whose skin started burning. The elephant fell in the Panchamuga tank opposite to the temple. Shiva is believed to have dipped in the northeast part of the tank and emerged from the southwest part of the tank. The aspect of Shiva is also known as Kirthivasa or one who wears an elephant skin as garment. Vazhuvur is also one of the places where Siva danced his cosmic dance to crush the demon of ignorance. Since the demon Taraka inhabited this place, the forest is named Tharuka Vanam the forest of Taruka. The place has other names like Parakayilayam, Gananbumi, Suyathapuri and Piplaraynam. During the great deluge, the village alone was not affected, leading to the Tamil name of Vazhuvur the place which is not affected.  Architecture  The temple is located in Vazhuvur, a village 2 km 1.2 mi away from manganallur in Mayiladuthurai - Thiruvarur road. The temple faces the East and has a five-tiered rajagopuram. The temple tank, the Panchamuga Theertham is located outside the main entrance. The sanctum houses the image of Veeratneeswarar in the form of lingam. The sanctum has ardhamandapa before it and a Mahamandapa, the worship hall. The Mahamandapa houses the metal image of Gajasamharamurthy sported with six hands holding six different weapons and shown emanating out of elephant with elephant skin at his foot. The image is in the form of Om. The Mahamandapam also houses other metal images of Murugan, Somaskanda and Vinayagar. The shrine of Ambal in the form of Gnangmigai faces South. The image is sported in standing posture with four hands. The temple has two precincts and all the shrines in the temple are enshrined in rectangular granite walls. The temple has other important sculptures in the panels around the sanctum. The temple dates from the time of the Medieval Cholas. The Gajasamharamurti idol was sculpted in the 11th century. The temple is built in the Dravidian style of architecture and is known for its exquisite bronze icons. Some of the popular bronze idols are those of Gajasamharamurti and Bhikshadana Shiva as mendicant. Most of the inscriptions in the temple are dated from the period of Medieval Cholas from 1160 to 1276 CE. The image of Parvathi holding Murugan is a notable sculpture in the temple.  Religious significance  As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andakasuran, Gajasuran, Jalandasuran, Thirupuradhi, Kaman, Arjunan, Dakshan and Taaragasuran. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury. The eight temples are: Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Vazhuvur or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. It is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Appar.  Festival and religious practices  The temple priests perform the pooja rituals during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva tem",

    "text": "KUSI-TV channel 51, cable channel 9 is an independent television station in San Diego, California, United States. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside Fox affiliate KSWB-TV channel 69. The two stations share studios on Viewridge Avenue near I-15 in the Kearny Mesa section of San Diego; KUSI-TVs transmitter is located southeast of Spring Valley. After a 15-year dispute over permit ownership that almost derailed the launch of the station on multiple occasions, KUSI began broadcasting in 1982 as a partnership between United States International University and McKinnon Broadcasting Company. It was the first independent station built in San Diego proper. Financial and accreditation problems at USIU led to the sale of its stake to McKinnon in 1990, with McKinnon exercising veto power to block any sale to another entity. McKinnon then started KUSIs news department, which has since grown to produce newscasts throughout the day. In 2023, McKinnon sold KUSI to Nexstar. The stations transmitter broadcasts KUSI and KSWB-TV in ATSC 3.0 NextGen TV format.  History   15 years of fighting  The construction permit for a channel 51 television station in San Diego was first issued on June 23, 1965, to Jack O. Gross, who had previously founded KFMB-TV channel 8, as KJOG-TV. The permit was issued after applications by Gross and California Western University of San Diego were filed the year before; Gross proposed a conventional independent station, while the private university planned a station with a high educational and cultural content. In October 1967, with the station still unbuilt, California Western filed to have the station transferred to it, stating that Gross was refusing to abide by an agreement reached that April to sell the station to CWU for 16,000 in expenses. However, a complication arose when Gross informed the Federal Communications Commission FCC that he had reached another deal to sell the station to the Broadmoor Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Michael and Dan McKinnon alongside local radio stations KSON 1240 AM and KSEA 97.3 FM and television station KIII of Corpus Christi, Texas, for 15,000. Under that agreement, Broadmoor would honor a deal brokered with the university, which had also applied for the channel, to acquire 50 percent. The situation, in which Gross reached sale agreements with two different buyers, prompted the FCC to designate an application to extend the life of the construction permit for hearing in late 1968, by which time the university had changed its name to United States International University USIU. FCC administrative law judge Basil P. Cooper in 1970 ruled that Gross had trafficked in the permit, by retaining an interest without the obligation to make further funds available, but granted the time extension. However, the FCCs review board, later joined by the full commission, reversed the initial decision in 1972 and denied the application for more time to build the station. A year later, however, the commission granted authority to extend the permit in order to consider the 1967 application to sell it to USIU, finding that Grosss actions did not merit immediate disqualification and would unfairly harm USIU. Broadmoor continued to challenge any authority by USIU to build KJOG-TV, and in 1975, the FCC designated the universitys acquisition of the construction permit for hearing, this time over concerns about whether USIU was financially qualified to construct the station and whether financial issues at the university itself, spurred by a long-delayed and complicated land sale in the early 1970s and the collapse of one of the universitys major lenders, weighed on its capacity. A religious group, Christian Communications Network, intervened in the proceeding in a bid to seek the use of the channel; it provided Christian television programming on local cable. On June 7, 1977, administrative law judge David I. Kraushaar ruled against the proposed transfer to USIU and its affiliate University Television, Inc., concerned over the financial issues and by cost estimates that were extremely low during a period of major inflation.  Early years and sale to McKinnon  In October 1980, administrative law judge James F. Tierney finally adjudicated the matter for good and granted the transfer application to University Television, dismissing Christian Communicationss complaints as unfounded.

    "text": "The Passion of Dionysus is the fifteenth album by New York heavypower metal group Virgin Steele, released via SPVSteamhammer worldwide on June 30, 2023. The concept album tells the story of the Greek god Dionysus and his coming to Thebes to avenge the slander of his mother how it is described in Euripides tragic play, The Bacchae. It explores the duality of the human emotional world between the rational and the irrational, thus taking up one of the most important themes of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The album received mostly positive reviews, but was also met with some criticism. While many critics praised the complex compositions as well as the innovative songwriting, the production was often criticized for being too artificial. Paul Hutchings of Metaltalk.net called The Passion of Dionysus a creative masterpiece. With a duration of almost 13-minutes, The Ritual of Descent is the longest single track the band has ever released.  Track listing  All music and lyrics by David DeFeis  Reception  For those who have followed VIRGIN STEELE all these years, this will not be unfamiliar terrain at all. This will be what they were expecting. High quality music brought to us by an extremely dedicated David DeFeis, who did all of it, except for the guitar parts. And I for one applaud him, because he has made The Passion Of Dionysus into a very good record, making sure that VIRGIN STEELE is once again noticed as a force to be reckoned with.

    "text": "The Quesnel River is a major tributary of the Fraser River in the Cariboo District of central British Columbia. It begins at the outflow of Quesnel Lake, at the town of Likely and flows for about 100 kilometres 60 mi northwest to its confluence with the Fraser at the city of Quesnel.  History  Just downstream from the outlet of Quesnel Lake, at the confluence of the Cariboo River, is the historically important ghost town of Quesnel Forks, a.k.a. the Forks, which was a junction point of the Quesnel and Cariboo Rivers. Various trails and wagon roads leading to the Cariboo goldfields lay across the low-hill range north of Quesnel Forks in the basin of the Cottonwood River. Both the Lillooet to Fort Alexandria wagon road and the later Cariboo Wagon Road came by Quesnel Forks but preferred to follow the valley of the Quesnel River to Quesnel and then east from there to the gold towns of Barkerville and Wells. The river took its name from Jules-Maurice Quesnel, who explored this region with Simon Fraser in 1808.  Natural history  The Quesnel River supports a number of fish species, the most significant of which are Sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Largescale sucker Catostomus macrocheilus, Longnose sucker Catostomus catostomus, Redside shiner Richardsonius balteatus, Northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis, Peamouth chub Mylocheilus caurinus, and Lake chub Couesius plumbeus. The salmon run of sockeye salmon experienced a major recovery in the late 20th century, sometimes surpassing the Adams River as the greatest sockeye producer in the Fraser basin. However, the river, wildlife, and nearby water sources is threatened by 10 million cubic meters of contaminated mine waste that escaped in August 2014.

Administration  The district has 6 communes, 34 villages as of 2019.  History  This ancient city was an important settlement of the Kingdom of Funan and may have been its capital. It may have been the Thinae, or Sinae Metropolis located by Claudius Ptolemy as the farthest known city to the east in his Geography. The site was first excavated in 1996 and was again excavated in 1999 as part of the Lower Mekong Archaeological Project. During the 1996 excavation, the University of Hawaii and the Royal University of Fine Arts initiated the excavation and focused on the sociopolitical complexity from 500 BC to 500 AD. This first excavation, however, was just preliminary research. The first objectives were: 1 Documentation of the sites layout and the range of its archaeological features 2 Evaluation of the integrity of subsurface materials and description of the sites stratigraphy 3 Collection of samples for dating portions of the archaeological site 4 Reconstructing the hydrology and natural environment of the early historic period in this region In this site various archaeological methods were used such as surface survey and mapping, test excavations, auger sampling and coring, and trenching with a backhoe. Unfortunately, the archeological project was disturbed by looting and illicit trafficking of Khmer antiquities, which continues as a serious problem into the 21st century.

    "text": "The Marsh Arabs Arabic: عرب الأهوار ʻArab al-Ahwār Arabs of the Marshlands, also referred to as Ahwaris, the Maʻdān Arabic: معدان dweller in the plains or Shroog Mesopotamian Arabic: شروگ those from the eastthe latter two often considered derogatory in the present dayare indigenous inhabitants of the Mesopotamian marshlands in the modern-day south Iraq, as well as in the Hawizeh Marshes straddling the IranIraq border. Comprising members of many different tribes and tribal confederations, such as the Āl Bū Muḥammad, Ferayghāt, Shaghanbah, Ahwaris had developed a culture centered on the marshes natural resources. Many of the marshes inhabitants were forcibly displaced during the Ahwari Genocide when the wetlands were drained during and after the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.  History   Origin theories  The origins of the Ahwari people are still a matter of some dispute. British colonial ethnographers found it difficult to classify some of Ahwaris social customs and speculated that they might have originated in Indus Valley Pakistan. They may have descended from the Zuṭṭ Jat people, who moved to the region of lower Iraq in the 8th and 9th centuries and followed similar customs and traditions. Some scholars such as Ali al-Wardi have claimed they are descended from the Nabataeans of Iraq, the Aramaic-speaking people who inhabited Lower Mesopotamia in the Middle Ages, and some of their clans even follow their ancestry to Islamized Mandaeans. Other scholars have proposed historical and genetic links between the Marsh Arabs and the ancient Sumerians due to shared agricultural practices, methods of house-building and location. There is, however, no written record of the marsh tribes until the ninth century and the Sumerians lost their distinct ethnic identity by around 1800 BCE, some 2700 years before. Links to Sumerian genetics can be traced back to the Arabization and assimilation of indigenous Mesopotamians. Others, however, have noted that much of the culture of Ahwaris is shared with the desert bedouin who came to the area after the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate.  19912003  The marshes had for some time been considered a refuge for elements persecuted by the government of Saddam Hussein, as in past centuries they had been a refuge for escaped slaves and serfs, such as during the Zanj Rebellion. By the mid-1980s, a low-level insurgency against Baathist drainage and resettlement projects had developed in the area, led by Sheik Abdul Kerim Mahud al-Muhammadawi of the Al bu Muhammad under the nom de guerre Abu Hatim. During the 1970s, the expansion of irrigation projects had begun to disrupt the flow of water to the marshes. However, after the First Gulf War 1991, the Iraqi government aggressively revived a program to divert the flow of the Tigris River and the Euphrates River away from the marshes in retribution for a failed Shia uprising. This was done primarily to eliminate the food sources of the Marsh Arabs and to prevent any remaining militiamen from taking refuge in the marshes, the Badr Brigades and other militias having used them as cover. The plan, which was accompanied by a series of propaganda articles by the Iraqi regime directed against the Madan, systematically converted the wetlands into a desert, forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. Villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned. The majority of Ahwaris were displaced either to areas adjacent to the drained marshes, abandoning their traditional lifestyle in favour of conventional agriculture, to towns and camps in other areas of Iraq or to Iranian refugee camps. Only 1,600 of them were estimated to still be living on traditional dibins by 2003. The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes had become completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes had dramatically shrunk. The Marsh Arabs, who numbered about half a million in the 1950s, have dwindled to as few as 20,000 in Iraq, according to the United Nations. As of 2003, an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 have fled to refugee camps in Iran. However, following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover, and many have returned to their native lands. The Observers Middle East correspondent Shyam Bhatia who spent two weeks with the Marsh Arabs in 1993 wrote the first eyewitness account of Iraqi army tactics at the time of draining the marshes, bombing Marsh villages and then sowing mines in the water before retreating. Bhatias extensive reportage won him the title of International Reporter of the Year, al",

    "text": "Augustinerkloster was one of the eight monasteries within the medieval city of Zürich in Switzerland. It was founded around 1270 as an Augustinian Order priory on the site of the present Augustinerkirche Zürich on Münzplatz, and was abolished in 1524.  Geography  Situated on todays Münzplatz that is named after the later mint, the street Augustinergasse is named after the abbey. The area of the convent was west of the St. Peterhofstatt square towards the then Fröschengraben moat. The Augustinerkirche Zürich, like the street with the same name, is named after the former Augustinian monastery, meaning the church of the Augustinian order. In the high European Middle Ages, the abbey was part of the fortifications of Zürich, situated on the lower slope of the Lindenhof hill, at the location of the so-called small Kecinstürlin gate at the southern Fröschengraben moat, the Augustinertor gate. The inner moat was enforced by the 16th-century Schanzengraben.  History  The city of Zürich supported the popular mendicant orders of the times by attributing free plots in the suburbs, requiring them to assist with the construction of the city wall in return. In the west of the area, the citys fortification was not yet built in the late 11th or 12th century, and the Augustinian monks were allowed to settle there. The monastery consisted of the present Romanesque church, and a building complex attached to the north of the church. The important late medieval city fortifications, namely the Augustinertor and the Augustinerturm tower gates, are mentioned as its western section. Until the 14th century memorial measurements in Zürich, as a basis for the increasing income, had to be held at Grossmünster. By 1524 all income obtained from funerals had also to be given to the Grossmünster abbey. Hence, like the other mendicant orders, the Augustinians were reduced to the status of area pastors within the medieval city. As a result, the order supported the Brun regime of the Guilds of Zürich and may therefore not have lost as much influence as its brother convents within the city walls, namely the Predigerkloster which even had to leave the city for one decade. During the Reformation in Zürich, the convent was abolished in 1524, worship in the church was discontinued, and the buildings and income of the monastery were assigned to an Amt, conducting administration for the city government Rat. In 1525 a wine press was installed, an alms institution established, and thereafter the administration was integrated in the so-called Rütiamt, the former Rüti Abbey. In 1841 the Roman Catholic community of Zürich planned to build a church to commemorate the old Augustinian church. But, as the majority of the Catholic community rejected the decisions of the First Vatican Council of 1870, the whole community was expelled from the Catholic church, forming the present Christkatholische Kirche der Schweiz. This explains why Augustinerkirche is still its Parish church.  Buildings  There was considerable construction activity, when the mendicant order, near the present Strohof Augustinergasse 3 from Werner Strouhmeier acquired the estates of that name in 1270. The order had to build the section of the town wall, south of the Lindenhof hill and St. Peterhofstatt towards the Fröschengraben moat. The monastery complex consisted of a rectangular four bay wing, housing the later Rütiamt, where the Augustinerturm gate was erected. On both sides of the lower edge of the roof of the tower, there were the two wings of the so-called Almosen office of 1524. The transverse wing was used as the refectory, the monks dining hall. The monastery area was separated by a wall from the urban environment. On the northwestern narrow side of the monastery, there is the present Augustinerkirche, the nave and chancel under one roof. The present roof skylights disappeared in 1692, and were rebuilt in 193637.  Stained glass windows  In 1519 the Augustinian community petitioned the governments of the thirteen members of the Old Swiss Confederacy for chapter house windows. The canton of Fribourg approved and one of the windows showed the attached coat of arms, marking a community foundation of Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen and Appenzell. The art dealer Martin Usteri acquired 32 glass panes in 1796, which were sold from his legacy in 1829, and came into the Gröditzberg in Silesia. From there, six of the former stained glass windows were bought by the Gottfried Keller Foundation in 1894, exhibited in the cloister of the Fraumünster cathedral, and then entrusted to the Swiss National Museum on deposit.

Enemies come in the form of insects, mollusks, reptiles, amphibians, and arachnids. Enemies are defeated by jumping on them, as well as utilizing power-ups which include damage dealing spittle and electrical strikes. Each level ends when the player jumps on a Bug Stop, which will then make the player proceed to the next level. Every level contains collectable items: 1-UPs supply the player with an extra life, collecting a heart will restore one hit point to the player whereas Bug Juice will fully replenish it, and a coin will allow the player to take part in a bonus round whereby they are given the chance to win more lives. If the player runs out of Bug Juice, they lose a life. The game will end once the player runs out of continues. Collectable items in the form of blue crystals are found scattered throughout the games levels. If the player collects 100 of them, they will earn an extra life along with a dragonfly icon, in which three icons are needed for the player to take part in a special bonus round involving a dragonfly ring chase. In addition, the player can collect power ups which will enable them to defeat enemies instantly. These come in the form of spit and zap attacks; the former allows Bug to fire missiles made out of saliva, and the latter unleashes a bolt of electricity. The levels featured in Bug! are linear  the player may only move in four directions despite the game appearing in full 3D. In addition to walking on a grid axis, the player-character can also walk up walls and upside down.  Plot  The games plot centers around the titular character, Bug, who is a Hollywood actor hoping to make his biggest break. Bug decides to sign up for the lead role in an upcoming action film, in which his family - composed of his pet, Maggot Dog, his younger brother, his girlfriend, his mother and his father - is captured by the villainous spider Queen Cadavra and must set out to rescue them. After traversing through insect infested grasslands, a reptile ruled dessert, a dangerous swamp, the bottom of the sea, a frozen tundra wasteland, and a volcanic mountain; he rescues his family one by one, defeating those Queen Cadarva left to hold them before facing the spider queen herself. Despite it being part of a movie, Cadarva was an actual villain who was aiming to take Bug out for real, even bringing in real monsters to aid her a cybernetically-enhanced snail, a giant reptile, a deadly sea snake, a monstrous octopus, and an abominable snow-bug. After a fierce fight, Bug manages to defeat her by pushing her into the volcano revealed to be real which destroys her. Afterwards, a movie is made of the events with no one knowing that what happened on it was real as Bug and his family attend its premier.  Development and release  Sega of America contracted Realtime Associates to create a Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Sega Saturns North American launch. When Sega of Japan rejected the use of Sonic, the Bug character, originally from a shelved Sega Genesis game, was chosen instead. Bug! was conceptualized as one of three candidates for mascots for Segas upcoming Sega Saturn console in 1994. The other candidates were 2.5D platformers Clockwork Knight which came out shortly before Bug! at the Saturns North American launch and Astal, which was released later in 1995. Realtime Associates developed the game using Silicon Graphics workstations, which were then used to pre-render the games characters and then convert them into sprites  in similar vein to the process used in Donkey Kong Country. According to producer Steve Apour: Once we were working on Bug!, wed meet twice a week to talk about gameplay, just to plow through it and decide what the system could do. Some ideas we werent able to include, such as the wait anima",

The film was presented at the Horizons section of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, where it received the Best Screenplay Award.  Plot  One day in Ostia, a charismatic watch seller manages to cheat the elderly Ines Vismara by selling her a faulty watch for 1,000 euros. This incident enrages Claudio, Ines son, a fascist proprietor of a gun shop, and destabilizes Ines to the point that she is run over by a van while crossing the street. Ines is saved and brought to the hospital by Dr. Pierpaolo Pavone, the head of an intellectual radical chic family. Pierpaolos wife, Laura, is an uncompromising film director, and their 25-year-old son, Federico, is a scholar passionate about Friedrich Nietzsche. Federico becomes upset when his professor, Nicola, informs him that he cannot join him in exhuming Nietzsches body. Pierpaolo is having an affair with Gaia, the young girlfriend of Bruno Parise, a colleague who enjoys playing pranks on him. One day, Federico manages to purchase a bomb from Claudio to destroy Nietzsches grave. Federico completes his mission despite being injured during the explosion. Flavio, Claudios uncle, informs him that after being arrested, Federico will reveal where he acquired the bomb. Because Federico is the son of a medic and a director, he wont be sent to jail. However, if the police discover Claudios guns, Claudio will surely be imprisoned. Consequently, Flavio orders Claudio to kill Federico. When Claudio confronts Federico, he discovers that Federico is the son of Pierpaolo, the medic who saved his mothers life, and aborts the mission. When Flavio demands an explanation, Claudio brings his 12-year-old gun-loving son, Cesare, to the meeting. Cesare shoots and kills Flavio with a shotgun. Claudio is arrested but retains his parental rights. A few months later, Bruno dies from brain cancer, which Pierpaolo had diagnosed. Gaia manages to find a new boyfriend in the very watch seller who triggered the entire series of events.

    "text": "See Template:Non-free Parliamentary copyright for Wikipedias image licensing tag. Parliamentary copyright is a form of copyright in works made by either of the two Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: the House of Lords or the House of Commons. It also applies to bills proposed in either House and to the devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom: the Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly or Senedd Cymru  the Welsh Parliament.  History  Parliamentary copyright was first created in the United Kingdom by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Prior to this legislation being passed, what is now covered by parliamentary copyright was Crown copyright. Parliamentary works produced prior to 1 August 1989 are therefore Crown, rather than parliamentary, copyright.  Application  Parliamentary copyright applies where a work is made by or under the direction or control of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Where parliamentary copyright applies, the work qualifies for copyright protection even though the usual requirements relating to qualifications for copyright protection may not apply. The House by whom, or under whose direction or control, the work is made is the first owner of any copyright in the work, and if the work is made by or under the direction or control of both Houses, the two Houses are joint first owners of copyright. Copyright in such a work is referred to in this Part as parliamentary copyright, notwithstanding that it may be, or have been, assigned to another person. Parliamentary copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work lasts for 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was made. Works made by or under the direction or control of the House of Commons or the House of Lords includes work made by an officer or employee of that House in the course of his duties, and any sound recording, film or live broadcast of the proceedings of that House, but a work is not regarded as made by or under the direction or control of either House simply because it has been commissioned by or on behalf of that House. In the case of a work of joint authorship where Parliamentary copyright applies, Parliamentary copyright only extends to the portion that it applies to and not the whole work. For the purposes of holding and enforcing copyright, the two Houses of Parliament, which otherwise only exist during the lifetime of a Parliament and not during a dissolution or prorogation are treated as having the legal capacities of a body corporate. The copyrights created by the act are enforceable by and in the name of the Speaker of the House of Commons, or the Clerk of the Parliaments in respect of the House of Lords.  Legislation   Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom  Copyright in bills introduced into Parliament belongs to one or both of the Houses of Parliament. A bill is normally introduced into one of the two Houses first, and once it is approved by one it goes to the other. Copyright in public bills belongs to the House into which the bill is introduced, and if it is passed by that House, it is then shared by both Houses jointly. The copyright starts from the time when the text of the bill is handed in to the House in which it is introduced. Copyright in private bills belongs to both Houses jointly and starts from the time when a copy of the bill is first deposited in either House. Copyright in a personal bill belongs in the first instance to the House of Lords, and if it is passed by that House, it is then shared by both Houses jointly. This copyright only starts when the bill has First Reading in the House of Lords. This form of parliamentary copyright ceases when a bill is granted royal assent, or if the bill does not receive royal assent, on the withdrawal or rejection of the bill or the end of the session. However, copyright in a bill continues even if rejected by the House of Lords if, by virtue of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, it remains possible for it to be presented for royal assent in that session. Once parliamentary copyright starts to apply in relation to a bill, it removes any other form of copyright which might have applied.  Bills in other legislatures  The same principles apply in respect of bills introduced into the Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly or the Senedd Cymru  Welsh Parliament, from the point a bill is introduced until it is either given royal assent, or withdrawn or rejected. In these cases, the copyright belongs to the corporate body of the respective legislature: the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission or the Senedd Commission.  Acts  When a bill of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or one of the devolved legislatures is given royal assent by the King, it becomes an act. Royal assent is also given to Church of England measures. Parliamentary copyright ends on royal assent and instead",

Description  The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society Centre aims to contribute to the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical and inclusive automated decision-making ADM. It was established at RMIT in 2020 with funding from the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council ARC and other partners. The Centre examines the social and technical aspects of ADM, seeing automated systems as the outcomes of interactions between people, machines, data and institutions. It has a particular focus on the domains of news and media, transport and mobility, social services and health.  Projects and initiatives  Research projects at the ADMS Centre range across automated systems, from autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles to the recommendation systems deployed in digital media. Researchers work on technologies from machine learning to blockchain. Projects are concerned with a wide spectrum of problems from digital inclusion to disinformation, addressing developments primarily in Australia and the Global South. Centre projects include:  Australian Search Experience project  This research project is investigating if and how search results on Google differ for different people using a crowd-sourcing process recruited from Australian internet users. It follows on from a similar project run by Algorithm Watch in Germany in 2017. As of August 2020, the results indicated that search personalisation is limited; however for some topics, such as COVID-19, there might be a high level of curation.  Considerate and Accurate Multi-party Recommender Systems for Constrained Resources  This project aims to develop a next generation recommender system that enables equitable allocation of constrained resources. The project will produce novel hybrid socio-technical methods and resources to create a Considerate and Accurate REcommender System CARES, evaluated with social science and behavioural economics lenses. CARES aims to transform the sharing economy by delivering systems and methods that improve user and non-user experiences, business efficiency, and corporate social responsibility.  Automated decision-making and the law  Centre researchers Dan Hunter and Kimberlee Weatherall are investigating the role of artificial intelligence, natural language processing and other technologies which are having a major impact on decision-making and administration across the legal system.

It was founded in October 2005 by Greg Costikyan and Johnny L. Wilson, former editor of Computer Gaming World, and is based in New York City. The company was announced September 29, 2005. Costikyan was the companys CEO while Wilson was executive vice president for community and content. On June 23, 2009, Costikyan announced that Manifesto was closing its doors, citing the 2008-2009 economic downturn, a lack of venture capital, and problems successfully marketing the company as a destination for independent games. According to Manifesto Games manifesto, the company aimed to avoid the narrowness of conventional retail channels by selling a large number of games taking advantage of The Long Tail, and allow developers to experiment technically and artistically. An example of Manifesto Games willingness to take risks is its support of Super Columbine Massacre RPG!. The Manifesto Games website was originally designed in ironic imitation of the Soviet Union in its early years; some of its content still reflects this choice.  Play This Thing  Initially, Manifesto Games also provided reviews of indie games, including games it does not sell, and discussion forums. In September 2007, Manifesto Games created a new game review website, Play This Thing. A team of reviewers including Greg Costikyan and Emily Short posted one review per day at the website, covering independent, alternative reality and big urban games, interactive fiction, and mods. Most of the games reviewed had no relation to Manifesto Games. The site carried reviews of non-computer games on Tabletop Tuesdays. The site was shut down in 2014.

    "text": "Teatro della Concordia Theatre of Union, is located in Monte Castello di Vibio, of the Umbria region in Italy. It is the smallest theatre allitaliana in the world.  Design  The architectural plan of Teatro della Concordia is a bell shape, with deep narrow hall opening to a proscenium and stage, which is a typical Italian theater design. The theatre has only 99 seats, which are distributed in 62 seats in boxes and 37 seats in the stalls. The auditorium has an area of 68 square metres 730 ft2, the stage 50 square metres 540 ft2 and the entrance hall 29 square metres 310 ft2. The theatre has public performances, and is regularly played.  History  19th century The Teatro della Concordia was built at the beginning of the 19th century, during the epoch of the Napoleonic Wars invasion, by nine prosperous Umbrian families. They wanted to support cultural ideals beyond the French Revolutions goals, including: the spirit of freedom, equality and brotherhood. The new theatre was opened in 1808. The interior of the theatre was later decorated in 1892 with frescos by Luigi Agretti. 20th century Due to a post-war WW II deteriorated condition, the building was closed in 1951. Thirty years later, in 1981, the municipality of Monte Castello di Vibio purchased the theatre and restored it under the direction of the architects Paolo Leonelli and Mario Struzzi. The Teatro della Concordia was reopened in 1993. In the same year the association Società del Teatro della Concordia was founded. In 1997 the Teatro della Concordia started a partnership with the Teatro Farnese of Parma. In 2008 the exhibition area Sala Espositiva Nello Latini was opened in the basement of the Teatro della Concordia on the occasion of its 200 Year Jubilee. Edoardo Brenci, the president of the Società del Teatro della Concordia, organizes every year series of events with stage productions, concerts, expositions and other events.  Performances  Among the known artists who have given performances at the Teatro della Concordia are, inter alia, the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, as well as the Austrian musician Johanna Beisteiner.

Biography  Edmund Trebus was born in Ostrowo, near Danzig Gdańsk, in what was then the newly established Weimar Republic now Poland, on 11 November 1918, the day of the Armistice. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 Trebus was conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He was then captured and served with the Allied forces in Italy, in an anti-tank unit of the II Corps of the Polish armed forces, which was under British command. After moving to England just after the Second World War, Trebus married Jozefa Noga in 1949. They had five children. Trebus had been a collector all his life and he was often seen pushing a handcart filled with his latest acquisitions, which he carefully sorted into separate piles in his garden and home. One of Trebuss major loves was Elvis Presley, and he managed to collect and store away a copy of almost every single Elvis record. In his eighties, living alone in a run-down house in Crouch End in North London, Trebus was constantly in trouble with the environmental health department of the London Borough of Haringey because of complaints about the rubbish surrounding his home. He lived in a tiny area on the ground floor of his house, surrounded by piles of rubbish, because he never threw anything away. In the BBC documentary series A Life of Grime, Trebus was repeatedly shown arguing with council workers who had been instructed to clear his house of the 515 cu yd 394 m3 of rubbish it contained. He was eventually rehoused at the Trentfield Nursing Home in Southgate, where he died at the age of 83. Following his death, the BBC broadcast an hour-long tribute, Mr Trebus: A Life of Grime.

Biography  Yudovin was born into a family of artisans in Beshenkovichi, Vitebsk Governorate of the Russian Empire now Belarus. He studied art from 1906 to 1910 at the School of Drawing and Painting in Vitebsk, under Yehuda Pen. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1910, to study at the School of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts from 1910 to 1911 and with artists Mstislav Dobuzhinsky and Moisey Bernstein from 1911 to 1913. From 1912 to 1914, Yudovin participated in the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition organized by S. An-skys Jewish Historical and Ethnographic Society, documenting and copying examples of Jewish folk art and ornaments. This sparked his lifelong interest in Jewish artistic traditions. In 1920 he, together with M. Malkin, published the album Jewish Folk Ornament Yidisher Folks-Ornament featuring 26 of his linocut prints. From 1918 to 1923, Yudovin lived in Vitebsk, teaching at the Art School and Jewish Pedagogical Technical School. His prints from this period often depicted shtetl life and Jewish folk themes, combining stylized folk elements with realistic details. After moving to Petrograd St. Petersburg in 1923, Yudovin worked as a curator at the Jewish Museum, created in materials of S. An-skys expedition, until its closure in 1928. In the 1930s to 1940s his work became more narrative and detailed to conform to Socialist Realism, though still focused on Jewish subjects and folk imagery. He illustrated books by Jewish authors and created prints portraying Jewish life on collective farms. Yudovin had solo exhibitions in Vitebsk 1926, Yaroslavl 1944, Leningrad 1956 and Jerusalem 1991. His art blended Russian avant-garde influence with a commitment to documenting and celebrating Jewish cultural traditions through his prints, drawings and book illustrations.

    "text": "Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles UAVs are widely deployed across diverse applications due to their mobility and agility. Recent advances in Large Language Models LLMs offer a transformative opportunity to enhance UAV intelligence beyond conventional optimization-based and learning-based approaches. By integrating LLMs into UAV systems, advanced environmental understanding, swarm coordination, mobility optimization, and high-level task reasoning can be achieved, thereby allowing more adaptive and context-aware aerial operations. This survey systematically explores the intersection of LLMs and UAV technologies and proposes a unified framework that consolidates existing architectures, methodologies, and applications for UAVs. We first present a structured taxonomy of LLM adaptation techniques for UAVs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG, and prompt engineering, along with key reasoning capabilities such as Chain-of-Thought CoT and In-Context Learning ICL. We then examine LLM-assisted UAV communications and operations, covering navigation, mission planning, swarm control, safety, autonomy, and network management. After that, the survey further discusses Multimodal LLMs MLLMs for human-swarm interaction, perception-driven navigation, and collaborative control. Finally, we address ethical considerations, including bias, transparency, accountability, and Human-in-the-Loop HITL strategies, and outline future research directions. Overall, this work positions LLM-assisted UAVs as a foundation for intelligent and adaptive aerial systems.",

While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebras structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: i how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, ii how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and iii to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebras representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics.",

While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7 in AUROCAUPRC and 1.1-1.7 in accuracyF1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform rawimputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction PhysioNet, 2019, where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2 AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6 lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.",

We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair e.g. DPO or grouped policy optimization strategies e.g. DAPO.

Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of 0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement 0.041 F1. We distill three generalizable lessons: 1 domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; 2 multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and 3 deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search.

    "text": "The merit of Conformal Prediction CP, as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.",

Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested. We decompose this task into two phases: a domain-agnostic feasibility phase that iteratively repairs any LP using IIS-guided diagnosis, and a domain-specific validation phase that enforces five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory. We test 22 API models from seven families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models with self-taught reasoning and solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7 Rational Recovery Rate RRR -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2 for the best API model and 21.3 on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair, where API models average 27.6 recovery rate versus 97.2 for trained models. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction, as API models restore only 27.6 of infeasible formulations; and operational rationale, as roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory.

Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from frac14 to frac12. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8 in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.",

Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement.

In practice, even minor urban changes require substantial manual effort to redraw geospatial layouts, slowing the iterative planning and decision-making procedure. Motivated by recent advances in agentic systems and multimodal reasoning, we formulate urban renewal as a machine-executable task that iteratively modifies existing urban plans represented in structured geospatial formats. More specifically, we represent urban layouts using GeoJSON and decompose natural-language editing instructions into hierarchical geometric intents spanning polygon-, line-, and point-level operations. To coordinate interdependent edits across spatial elements and abstraction levels, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework that jointly performs multi-level planning and execution with explicit propagation of intermediate spatial constraints. We further introduce an iterative execution-validation mechanism that mitigates error accumulation and enforces global spatial consistency during multi-step editing.

Within this recurrent framework, we systematically study how depth-wise horizon allocations affect optimization, best-checkpoint perplexity, and efficiency. By allocating different history-window lengths across layers while keeping the total recurrent-state budget fixed, DSMR creates depth-dependent temporal receptive fields within a recurrent attention stack without reducing compute depth. Our main instantiation is a two-scale DSMR schedule that allocates long history windows to lower layers and a uniform short window to the remaining layers. Experiments on the piano performance dataset MAESTRO demonstrate that two-scale DSMR provides a practical quality--efficiency recipe for full-length long-context symbolic music modeling with recurrent attention under limited computational resources.",

Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance e.g., squared loss that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions.

In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size.

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context e.g., cell type and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coefficients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations.

Generic automatic differentiation VI ADVI, by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, confirming the value of model-specific derivations.

Effective generators must therefore balance support fidelity -- placing probability mass near the data manifold -- with sampling efficiency. Diffusion models often capture near-manifold structure but require many iterative denoising steps and can leak off-support; normalizing flows sample in one pass but are limited by invertibility and dimension preservation. We propose MAGT Manifold-Aligned Generative Transport, a flow-like generator that learns a one-shot, manifold-aligned transport from a low-dimensional base distribution to the data space. Training is performed at a fixed Gaussian smoothing level, where the score is well-defined and numerically stable. We approximate this fixed-level score using a finite set of latent anchor points with self-normalized importance sampling, yielding a tractable objective. MAGT samples in a single forward pass, concentrates probability near the learned support, and induces an intrinsic density with respect to the manifold volume measure, enabling principled likelihood evaluation for generated samples.

In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models Random Forest and XGBoost and one deep learning DL model TabNet were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance tree-based models and attention-based feature attribution TabNet revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features release height, stability category, and downwind distance, treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables.

However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer AAT, which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples to improve the attack performance.

Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agents observations and a model of the environment dynamics.

To address this limitation, we introduce DiffuNovo, a novel regressor-guided diffusion model for de novo peptide sequencing that provides explicit peptide-level mass control.

In this paper, we address this gap. Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used datasets.",

Yet fundamental questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we prove that the Echo-State Property wash-out of initial conditions together with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property geometric forgetting of remote inputs. Tight algebraic tests translate activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds, covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the textitedge of chaos. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully trained recurrent networks in practice.",

First, an encoder block converts the operands from a twos complement to a sign magnitude representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9 lower switching activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly smaller input range of -7 to 7, switching activity reductions can reach up to 33. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10 improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.",

While theoretical work has established the evolvability of specific function classes under idealized conditions, the framework remains largely untested empirically. In this paper, we implement a genetic algorithm that faithfully simulates Valiants model and conduct extensive experiments across six Boolean function classes: monotone conjunctions, monotone disjunctions, parity, majority, general conjunctions, and general disjunctions. Our study examines evolvability under uniform and non-uniform distributions, investigates the effects of fixed initial hypotheses and the removal of neutral mutations, and highlights how these constraints alter convergence behavior. We validate known results e.g., evolvability of monotone conjunctions, non-evolvability of parity and offer the first empirical evidence on the evolvability of majority and general Boolean classes. Our findings reveal sharp performance drops at intermediate dimensions and expose the essential role of neutral mutations in escaping fitness plateaus. We also demonstrate that evolvability can depend strongly on the input distribution. These insights clarify practical limits of evolutionary search and suggest new directions for theoretical work, including potential refinements to evolvability definitions and bounds.

Most existing SNNs are based on neural dynamics such as the leaky integrate-and-fire IFLIF models, which are described by first-order ordinary differential equations ODEs with Markovian characteristics. This means the potential state at any time depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network expressiveness. Empirical studies of real neurons, however, reveal long-range correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting non-Markovian behavior better modeled by fractional-order ODEs.Motivated by this, we propose a fractional-order spiking neural network f-SNN framework that strictly generalizes integer-order SNNs and captures long-term dependencies in membrane potential and spike trains via fractional dynamics, enabling richer temporal patterns. We also release an open-source toolbox to support the f-SNN framework, applicable to diverse architectures and real-world tasks. Experimentally, fractional adaptations of established SNNs into the f-SNN framework achieve superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, and improved robustness to noise, underscoring the promise of f-SNNs as an effective extension of traditional SNNs.",

    "text": "Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called impulse control, is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks SNNs have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.",

However, it is unclear the extent to which these algorithms fully explore the space of possible spiking solutions to problems. We investigated whether spiking networks trained with surrogate gradient descent can learn to make use of information that is only encoded in the timing and not the rate of spikes. We constructed synthetic datasets with a range of types of spike timing information interspike intervals, spatio-temporal spike patterns or polychrony, and coincidence codes. We find that surrogate gradient descent training can extract all of these types of information. In more realistic speech-based datasets, both timing and rate information is present. We therefore constructed variants of these datasets in which all rate information is removed, and find that surrogate gradient descent can still perform well. We tested all networks both with and without trainable axonal delays. We find that delays can give a significant increase in performance, particularly for more challenging tasks. To determine what types of spike timing information are being used by the networks trained on the speech-based tasks, we test these networks on time-reversed spikes which perturb spatio-temporal spike patterns but leave interspike intervals and coincidence information unchanged. We find that when axonal delays are not used, networks perform well under time reversal, whereas networks trained with delays perform poorly. This suggests that spiking neural networks with delays are better able to exploit temporal structure.

As large language models LLMs have demonstrated superior code generation abilities, recent MILP works are devoted to leveraging the evolutionary computation approaches with LLMs to generate effective primal heuristics. Although the generated heuristics have achieved better solving performance than the hand-crafted ones with little adaptability, the advantage of current LLM-based methods is limited to few MILP instances in one problem class, as they fail to capture the instance characteristics in the problem class the MILP instances generated from the same mathematical model are defined as a problem class. Since MILP instances often differ significantly in structure and feature distribution, the neglect of their characteristics in the evolution process results in poor generalization within the same problem class. To overcome this challenge, we propose a data-algorithm co-evolution framework DHEvo that iteratively selects representative instances and evolves corresponding heuristics. With the initial instance distribution, we develop an LLM-based multi-agent system to generate data-code pairs simultaneously. These data-code pairs are iteratively refined based on their fitness scores, leading to the identification of the most effective heuristic over the entire problem class.

The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image. This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced crack detection networks.

    "text": "Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution SCOPE. SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform DCT to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20 increase in efficacy. SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98 decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.",

We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored neural-architecture-search NAS procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16 on CIFAR-10, 76.48 on CIFAR-100, 43.42 on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51 top-1 on ImageNet.

We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations.

We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure.

The proposed approach comprises a population of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units NHUs, each combining spiking neuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve candidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimisers coordination arises through native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local information sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration. We implement this framework on Intels Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2 chip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We deploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly considering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking neural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for spike-triggered heuristics. Although these configurations are implemented as a proof of concept, we document and outline further extensions and improvements to the framework implementation. Results show that the proposed approach exhibits structured population dynamics, consistent convergence, and milliwatt-level power feasibility. They also position spike-native MHs as a viable path toward real-time, low-energy, and decentralised optimisation.",

Overcoming this limitation without relying on nonlinear optical materials could unlock unprecedented opportunities for ultrafast and parallel optical computing systems. Here, we demonstrate that large-scale nonlinear computation can be performed using linear optics through optimized diffractive processors composed of passive phase-only surfaces. In this framework, the input variables of nonlinear functions are encoded into the phase of an optical wavefront, e.g., via a spatial light modulator SLM, and transformed by an optimized diffractive structure with spatially varying point-spread functions to yield output intensities that approximate a large set of unique nonlinear functions, all in parallel. We provide proof establishing that this architecture serves as a universal function approximator for an arbitrary set of bandlimited nonlinear functions, also covering multi-variate and complex-valued functions. We also numerically demonstrate the parallel computation of one million distinct nonlinear functions, accurately executed at wavelength-scale spatial density at the output of a diffractive optical processor. Furthermore, we experimentally validated this framework using in situ optical learning and approximated 35 unique nonlinear functions in a single shot using a compact setup consisting of an SLM and an image sensor. These results establish diffractive optical processors as a scalable platform for massively parallel universal nonlinear function approximation, paving the way for new capabilities in analog optical computing based on linear materials.",

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems.

Recent data, for example, shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a low power mode in which they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate ATP use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties resting potential and leak conductance which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been observed empirically.",

Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI 4DF. This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics CFD simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications.

We take an indirect approach to this question: rather than analyzing the model architecture or training dynamics, we ask why a pretrained Bayes estimator, trained under a prespecified training distribution, can adapt to arbitrary test distributions. Focusing on Poisson EB problems, we identify the existence of universal priors such that training under these priors yields a near-optimal regret bound of widetildeOfrac1n uniformly over all test distributions. Our analysis leverages the classical phenomenon of posterior contraction in Bayesian statistics, showing that the pretrained transformer adapts to unknown test distributions precisely through posterior contraction.

For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the τ-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order tilde Odvarepsilon, with d the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size S and improving existing bounds by a factor of d; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified τ-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by d log S but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs.

In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints emphe.g., via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum. We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and emphpositive constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints. Specifically, under emphfull feedback we propose an algorithm attaining widetildemathcalOsqrtTC regret and widetildemathcalOsqrtTC positive violation, where C quantifies the amount of non-stationarity in the constraints. We then show how to extend these guarantees when only bandit feedback is available for the losses.

Given a query light curve, we identify similar simulated light curves from the simulation bank by measuring similarity in the learned embedding space produced by pretrained U-Net encoder, yielding an initial empirical approximation to the posterior over parameters. This initialization is then refined using a local optimization procedure using hill-climbing updates, guided by a forward simulator, progressively shifting the empirical posterior toward higher-likelihood parameter regions. Experiments on the observed light curve of PSR J00300451, captured by NASAs Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer NICER, show that our method closely matches posterior estimates obtained using traditional MCMC methods while achieving 120 times reduction in inference time from 24 hours to 12 minutes, demonstrating the effectiveness of learned representations and simulator-guided optimization for accelerated posterior inference.",

First, we consider sampling from a target distribution with density proportional to exp-fx supported on a convex set K subset mathbbRd, where f is convex. The main challenge is enforcing feasibility without degrading mixing. Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in mathbbRd1. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for K and a subgradient oracle for f, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set. Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to exp-fx-hx with closed and convex f and h. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with f modeling data fidelity and h encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of h to constrained sampling in mathbbRd1, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in mathbbRd2, on which we apply a proximal sampler. By keeping f and h separate, we further demonstrate how different combinations of oracle access such as subgradient and proximal can be leveraged to construct separation oracles for the lifted problem. For both sampling problems, we establish mixing time bounds measured in Rényi and χ2 divergences.",

To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes CMDPs are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance.

We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an varepsilon-optimal policy with varepsilon-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring tildeOleftfracSAH3varepsilon2right learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs.

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: 1 a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, 2 a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and 3 a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.",

Personalized Federated Learning PFL mitigates this issue by considering client-specific models. A widely adopted approach in PFL decomposes neural networks into a shared feature extractor and client-specific heads. While effective, this design induces a fundamental tradeoff: deep or expressive shared components hinder personalization, whereas large local heads exacerbate overfitting under limited per-client data. Most existing methods rely on rigid, shallow heads, and therefore fail to navigate this tradeoff in a principled manner. In this work, we propose a boosting-inspired framework that enables a smooth control of this tradeoff. Instead of training a single personalized model, we construct an ensemble of T models for each client. Across boosting iterations, the depth of the personalized component are progressively increased, while its effective complexity is systematically controlled via low-rank factorization or width shrinkage. This design simultaneously limits overfitting and substantially reduces per-client bias by allowing increasingly expressive personalization. We provide theoretical analysis that establishes generalization bounds with favorable dependence on the average local sample size and the total number of clients. Specifically, we prove that the complexity of the shared layers is effectively suppressed, while the dependence on the boosting horizon T is controlled through parameter reduction. Notably, we provide a novel nonlinear generalization guarantee for decoupled PFL models.

Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law FSL framework introduced in Li et al. 2025a provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model LLM pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions.

In the high-dimensional regime, we derive deterministic-equivalent recursions for the prediction risk and effective noise across iterations, and prove that the empirical quantities concentrate sharply around these limits. The recursion separates two competing forces: a systematic component that grows with iteration due to progressive signal forgetting, and a stochastic component that decays due to denoising via repeated data-dependent projections. Their interaction yields a U-shaped test-risk curve and an optimal early-stopping time. In spiked covariance models, iteration further acts as an iteration-dependent spectral filter that preserves strong eigendirections while suppressing weaker ones, inducing an implicit form of soft feature selection distinct from ridge regression. Finally, we propose an iterated generalized cross-validation criterion and prove its uniform consistency for estimating the risk along the self-training trajectory, enabling fully data-driven selection of the stopping time and regularization.

While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of distilled models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble. An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model superclusters, as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state.

However, when hazards are non-proportional, the hazard ratio can lose a stable causal interpretation and become study-dependent because it effectively averages time-varying effects with weights determined by follow-up and censoring. We consider the average hazard AH as an alternative causal estimand: a population-level person-time event rate that remains well-defined and interpretable without assuming proportional hazards. Although AH can be estimated nonparametrically and regression-style adjustments have been proposed, existing approaches do not provide a general framework for flexible, high-dimensional nuisance estimation with valid sqrtn inference. We address this gap by developing a semiparametric, doubly robust framework for covariate-adjusted AH. We establish pathwise differentiability of AH in the nonparametric model, derive its efficient influence function, and construct cross-fitted, debiased estimators that leverage machine learning for nuisance estimation while retaining asymptotically normal, sqrtn-consistent inference under mild product-rate conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves small bias and near-nominal confidence-interval coverage across proportional and non-proportional hazards settings, including crossing-hazards regimes where Cox-based summaries can be unstable. We illustrate practical utility in comparative effectiveness research by comparing immunotherapy regimens for advanced melanoma using SEER-Medicare linked data.",

We apply generalized degrees of freedom GDF to measure model complexity in FFNNs with binary outcomes, adapting the algorithm for discrete responses. We compare GDF with both the effective number of parameters derived via log-likelihood cross-validation and the null degrees of freedom of Landsittel et al. Through simulation studies and a real data analysis, we demonstrate that GDF provides a robust assessment of model complexity for neural network models, as it depends only on the sensitivity of fitted values to perturbations in the observed responses rather than on assumptions about the likelihood. In contrast, cross-validation-based estimates of model complexity and the null degrees of freedom rely on the correctness of the assumed likelihood and may exhibit substantial variability. We find that GDF, cross-validation-based measures, and null degrees of freedom yield similar assessments of model complexity only when the fitted model adequately represents the data-generating mechanism.

    "text": "Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler KL divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the coding rate -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the firing rate -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder P-VAE -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of sparse coding as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient β and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing β monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation.",

We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters.

Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an ellp penalty.

Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for ellp regularizers where p ge 2.

These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: 1 The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. 2 Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles and to preserve layout-specific distinctions e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content. 3 Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document. To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree CCTree to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports 1 layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and 2 LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97-61.07 in accuracy. The code is at",

While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner. We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models.",

We propose ReMix Rejection Mixing, a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a tokens representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding.

Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs KG with chains of thought CoT. TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned SFT LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning.

As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control.

NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P.

Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees Tries incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators TPUsGPUs. In this work, we introduce STATIC Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding, an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUsGPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row CSR matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead 0.033 ms per step and 0.25 of inference time, achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval.

Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models MDLMs. TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model.

Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance.

    "text": "Stereotype repositories are critical to assess generative AI model safety, but currently lack adequate global coverage. It is imperative to prioritize targeted expansion, strategically addressing existing deficits, over merely increasing data volume. This work introduces a multilingual stereotype resource covering four sub-Saharan African countries that are severely underrepresented in NLP resources: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. By utilizing socioculturally-situated, community-engaged methods, including telephonic surveys moderated in native languages, we establish a reproducible methodology that is sensitive to the regions complex linguistic diversity and traditional orality. By deliberately balancing the sample across diverse ethnic and demographic backgrounds, we ensure broad coverage, resulting in a dataset of 3,534 stereotypes in English and 3,206 stereotypes across 15 native languages.",

    "text": "Internet memes have become a dominant form of expression on social media, including within the Bengali-speaking community. While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign, a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model, a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members. Viewer discretion is advised.",

    "text": "ElI5 how does the existence of lead directly disprove the earth isnt only 4000 years old?. I recently saw a screenshot of a Facebook post of someone declaring the earth is only 4000 years old and someone replying that the existence of lead disproves it bc the halflife of uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years old. I get this is a setup post, but I just dont understand how lead proves its not. The only way for lead to exist is to decay from uranium-238? Like how do we know this? Just because it does eventually decay into lead means that all lead that exist HAS to come from it? Edit: I am not trying to argue the creationist side of the original screenshot of a post I saw. Im trying to understand the response to that creationist side. I have since learned that the response in the oop conveniently leaves out that its not the existence of all lead but specific types of lead that can explain that the earth is not only 4000 years old through the process of radioactive decay and the existence of specific types of lead in specific conditions. Its also hilarious to see the amount of people jumping in to essentially say creationist are dumb and you are dumb to even interact with them and completely ignoring the fact that Im questioning a comment left on a post that I saw in a screenshot of on a completely different platform. And also thank you to everyone taking the time to explain that the commenter in oop gave a less than truthful explanation and then explaining the truth.",

    "text": "ELI5 What does the second law of thermodynamics actually mean, and how does it relate to evolution?. My chemistry class is just me and my teacher, and we only meet like once a week. She wants me to write a paragraph on my own personal thoughts about evolution since it is from a Christian academy I already know how people on this site feel about religion, please dont rant about it, so naturally the idea of how evolution works is something that would get brought up. She wants to know my personal thoughts on it, but I dont really understand it enough to write one as of right now. The books say the second law suggests that things only remain the same amount of disorder or get more disordered, but I dont really understand what that means. Ill hopefully look more into the second law before reading comments, but I am curious on what the second law actually means since she expected me to look into it. My teacher brought up how the second law of thermodynamics could disprove the current ideas we have of evolution. She also said that evolution still could be plausible, but the existing theories are mainly disproven by the second law. Is evolution really disproven by thermodynamics? I feel like with how heavily discussed the idea is that it wouldnt make sense. We already know creatures relate to each other and that creatures adapt to environments. I dont understand how this law relates to the idea of evolution or how it disproves the idea. Another thing that she said that confused me was that it wouldnt make sense if humans came from chimpanzees since chimpanzees still exist. I said I heard that they actually came from a common ancestor. Is the fact that there is more primitive versions of a species that exist proof they couldnt have had a common ancestor or come from one another?",

This means you can have millions of independent databases: one for each agent, tenant, user, or document.pUseful for:p- AI agents: per-agent DB for message history, state, embeddingsp- Multi-tenant SaaS: real per-tenant isolation, no RLS hacksp- Collaborative documents: each document gets its own database with built-in multiplayerp- Per-user databases: isolated, scales horizontally, runs at the edgepThe idea of splitting data per entity isnx27;t new: Cassandra and DynamoDB use partition keys to scale horizontally, but youx27;re stuck with rigid schemas quot;single-table designquot; 3, limited queries, and painful migrations. SQLite per entity gives you the same scalability without those tradeoffs 2.pHow this compares:p- Cloudflare Durable Objects amp; Agents: most similar to Rivet Actors with colocated SQLite and compute, but closed-source and vendor-lockedp- Turso Cloud: Great platform, but closed-source  diff use case. Clients query over the network, so reads are slow or stale. Rivetx27;s single-writer actor model keeps reads local and fresh.p- D1, Turso the DB, Litestream, rqlite, LiteFS: great tools for running a single SQLite database with replication. Rivet is for running lots of isolated databases.pUnder the hood, SQLite runs in-process with each actor. A custom VFS persists writes to HA storage FoundationDB or Postgres.pRivet Actors also provide realtime WebSockets, React integration useActor, horizontal scalability, and actors that sleep when idle.pGitHub: a href relnofollow a href",

I built iunfi after I pasted a prompt into the wrong agent terminal and it overwrote hours of hand-edits across a handful of files. Git couldnx27;t help because I hadnx27;t finishedx2F;committed my in progress work. I wanted something that recorded every save automatically so I could rewind to any point in time. I wanted to make it difficult for an agent to permanently screw anything up, even with an errant irm -rfipiunfi is a background daemon that watches directories you choose via CLI and snapshots every text file on save. It stores file contents in an object store, tracks metadata in SQLite, and gives you a CLI to query and restore any version. The install includes a UI, as well to explore the history through time.pThe tool skips binaries and respects .gitignore if one exists. The interface borrows from git so it should feel familiar: iunf logi, iunf diffi, iunf restorei.pI say quot;UN-EFquot; vs U.N.F, but thatx27;s for yx27;all to decide: I started by calling the project Unfucked and got unfucked.ai, which if you know me and the messes I get myself into, is a fitting purchase.pThe CLI command is unf and the Tauri desktop app is titled quot;Unfudgedquot; kids safe name.pHow it works: a href relnofollow summary belowpThe daemon uses FSEvents on macOS and inotify on Linux. When a file changes, unf hashes the content with BLAKE3 and checks whether that hash already exists in the object store  if it does, it just records a new metadata entry pointing to the existing blob. If not, it writes the blob and records the entry. Each snapshot is a row in SQLite. Restores read the blob back from the object store and overwrite the file, after taking a safety snapshot of the current state first so restoring is itself reversible.pThere",
