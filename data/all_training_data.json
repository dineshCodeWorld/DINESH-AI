    "text": "The 2011 Omani protests also called the Omani Spring were a series of protests in Oman that occurred as part of the revolutionary wave popularly known as the Arab Spring. The protesters demanded salary increases, lower living costs, the creation of more jobs and a reduction in corruption. Protests in Sohar, Omans fifth-largest city, centered on the Globe Roundabout. One of the responses of the then Sultan Qaboos bin Said was the dismissal of a third of the governing cabinet.  Issues  Protesters demanded salary increases and lower costs of living. On 20 February 2011, protesters welcomed a move by the government to increase the minimum wage. The wage increase targeted Omani workers in the private sector. Public sector Omani employees have received wage increases in the past, but the private sector was so far overlooked. The Government of Oman raised minimum wages for an estimated 150,000 private sector employees to 520 from 364 a month. As protests continued in Sohar the demands were still jobs and political reforms. The protesters also want more jobs, freedom of expression, less government control over the media, political reforms, better living conditions, an abolition of taxes and the trial of all ministers. Protesters in Muscat also demanded cabinet ministers not serve more than four years. In several other protests, Omanis furthered their demands by calling for a reduction of foreign workers in order to provide more jobs for Omani citizens by private companies.  Anti-government protests   Muscat protests  About 200 protesters marched on 17 January demanding salary increases and lower costs of living. The protest surprised international observers, who have viewed Oman as a politically stable and sleepy country. Renewed protests termed as the Green March, occurred on 18 February, inspired by the serious unrest in fellow Persian Gulf state Bahrain. 350 people took part in the march, demanding an end to corruption and better distribution of oil revenue. The protesters also carried signs with slogans of support for the Sultan. Police did not intervene in the gathering, and later after the protest took place, Sayyid Ali bin Hamoud bin Ali Al Busaidi, minister of the Diwan of Royal Court, announced that he had handed over the petition calling for reforms submitted by those who participated in the Green March to Sultan Qaboos bin Said. On 1 March, about 50 protesters held a sit-in as well outside the Consultative Assembly to demand political reform and an end to corruption. The group later grew to over 400 people. Protesters also continued to demand the Consultative Assembly be turned into a real parliament. The protests were reported to be peaceful, well-organised and very disciplined. Tents had been set up with separate accommodations for men and women. Placards with protest slogans had also been translated into English, French and German for the international media. On 2 April, dozens of protesters staged a sit-in in Muscat, outside the chief prosecutors office, to demand probes into alleged state abuses after clashes with security forces a day earlier.  Sohar protests  On 26 February, nearly 500 protesters gathered around a shopping mall in the industrial city of Sohar, 230 kilometres from the capital Muscat. The protesters stopped traffic and shoppers around the mall premises. The shops in the area including the mall remained closed on 27 February as well. On 27 February, protesters returned in Sohar for a second day, hurling stones at security forces who had cordoned them off. The Royal Oman Police eventually used tear gas and rubber bullets to contain and disperse the protesters. According to witnesses, two protesters were killed. On 28 February, protesters looted and burned a hypermarket in Sohar. The demonstrators also blocked the entrance to Sohar port, where 160,000 barrels of oil derived products are exported. On 1 March protests continued for a fourth day as crowds in Sohar congregated at the Globe Roundabout. Eventually, the Omani army, backed by tanks, peacefully dispersed protesters blocking the Sohar port and cleared them from the main coastal highway linking Muscat to Sohar. The troops later pulled back, though five armoured vehicles continued to watch the square. The Globe Roundabout had been the site of up to 2,000 demonstrators over the past three days. After reports of multiple deaths, the minister of health of Oman claimed only one person had been killed and 20 wounded. A Facebook page entitled March 2 Uprising for Dignity and Freedom called for further protests in all parts of Oman, beginning on 2 March, and it attracted more than 2,300 users. However, protests only occurred at the Globe Roundabout in Sohar with a smaller crowd of 50 protesters who blockaded the area. Some people had organised community policing groups to prevent more damage. The army also issued a red alert to vacate the area or threatened action. The Sohar Citizen Committee",

In addition to the domestic league, the club participated in the FA Cup, Football League Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup.  Season summary  In the 199192 season, Terry Venables became chief executive, with Peter Shreeves again taking charge of first-team duties. Tottenham were competing in Europe that season, in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, reaching the quarter-final where they were edged out by Dutch side Feyenoord.

The home arena of Tromsø Storm is Tromsøhallen, which has an official capacity of approximately 2,500 spectators, though it has been known to hold more.  History  Tromsø Storm has been playing in the BLNO since the Norwegian league was officially revitalized in the year 2000. Prior to this, the club was playing in the Norwegian top division under the name Tromsø Basketball Klubb TBBK. TBBK won the play-offs in the Norwegian top division in 1997 and lost the finals in 1998. The club has not been able to copy this achievement under its new name, even though it has come close on several occasions. Initially Tromsø Storm performed in the low and mid-range of the league table, but since the 200607 campaign the team has had only winning seasons. It has also won the regular season series three times. Despite these achievements, the club has not been able to make it through to the play-off finals. Tromsø Storm has been one of the two clubs in the league with the highest attendances on average, with an all-time high in the final match of the 20062007 season when a full packed arena saw the team beat the arch rival Harstad Vikings in the final match of the regular season, bringing the team to the top of the league table and winning the league championship.

    "text": "Corinne Orr born January 6, 1936 is a Canadian actress. She is best known for her work on the English version of the anime series Speed Racer.  Biography  Orr became involved in childrens theatre beginning at the age of 10 with her first role being in Alice in Wonderland after she began taking elocution lessons due to her French accent, and started to develop her repertoire of voices. By the age of 14, she was working at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC, as well as acting in stage theaters at the Mountain Playhouse in Montreal and the Crest Theatre in Toronto, working for the Montreal Shakespearian Company and alongside such notables as William Shatner, Christopher Plummer, and Barry Morse. With her solid background on the stage, Orr was hired by CBC Radio for roles in their radio dramas such as Laura Limited. She then moved to CBC Television to portray the character of Suzie the Mouse in the childrens soap opera Chez Helene, a bilingual program devoted to teaching children English and French. Following her move to New York City, Orr began working regularly on radio and television, and as a voice artist, having been credited over 200 voice-over roles. One of her first jobs was a continuing role in the daytime soap opera The Nurses; others included voice acting roles in several CBS Radio Adventure Theater and CBS Radio Mystery Theater programs.

    "text": "The Perry County Courthouse is a government building for Perry County that lies on the main square in Perryville, Missouri, United States.  Early Structures  Four structures have served as the home of Perry Countys courts and administration since Perry Countys creation. The first structure was a temporary home for the court, while the latter three structures were constructed solely to house the county courts and administration. The first structure was a two-story log building which served as the site of the county court after the creation of Perry County in 1821, and housed the court until a courthouse building could be built in 1826. The first building solely built to serve as the county courthouse was constructed in 1826 at a cost of 1,486.25. No known photos exist of this building. The first courthouse building of 1826 was replaced in 1861 with a new two-story stone building at a cost of 8,000. The second courthouse building constructed in 1861, however, had eventually fallen into disrepair and was replaced with the third and present brick courthouse in 1903 at a cost of 31,819.  History  In the early days before statehood, court sessions took place in private homes or the parish houses. By 1821, the population of the Barrens and surrounding area warranted the separation of the southeastern portion of Ste. Genevieve County into a new county, Perry County. After Perry County was organized in 1821, the county court was established on May 21, 1821 in the home of Bede Moore, located two and half miles north of Perryville, by Lewis Cissell, D.L. Caldwell, and Samuel Anderson. County officials used a two-story log building for conducting county business. At first, there was a delay in building a court house as the population of Perry County had also been obliged to help fund the courthouse in Ste. Genevieve County, as they had been a part of that county. Commissioners were appointed to locate a seat of justice somewhere in the county, but no move was made toward the erection of a courthouse until 1825. Because of its centrality, population, and location on the historic road between Ste. Genevieve and Cape Girardeau, the area just east of the Barrens was chosen to be the seat of Perry County. Bernard Layton donated fifty-one acres of his land one-half miles east of St. Marys Seminary for the site of a county-seat town, Perryville. In 1825, it was decided that a more permanent building was needed to house the county court and administration, so a contract was let for the first courthouse. Funding of the 1,486.25 1825 dollars project came from the sale of 55 lots of property deeded to the county by Bernard Layton. No known illustrations of the structure exist. By 1859, a growing county created a need for more space. The court appropriated 8,000 1859 dollars for construction and appointed John E. Layton as superintendent of the construction. The two-story building was completed in 1861. The site of the building was on the northeast corner of the square. The building continued in use until after the turn of the century. Grand jury reports from that time indicated the condition of the building was beyond repair. After county residents presented a petition calling for an election on September 1, 1903, voters approved a proposition for a 30,000 bond issue to finance a new courthouse. From several plans submitted in November, the court selected the proposal of Caldwell and Drake, Columbus, Indiana, who were then contracted for construction. Construction began in February, 1904. The cornerstone ceremonies were conducted on June 4, 1904. The total cost on the red brick, 65-by-92-foot building was 31,819. The county continues to use the courthouse for county court and administration purposes. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.  Circuit Court  The Perry County Court House is home to Perry County, Judicial Circuit 32.  Courthouse Square  The courthouse is located on the main square in Perryville, and is complete with a chiming clock tower. On the grounds are a war memorial, civil war memorial, a Camino Real Marker and a number of other markers. Around the courthouse is the courthouse lawn which features a brick paved plaza, landscaped seating areas, park benches, a sundial, a directional marker and a gazebo.

Involvement in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974  After completing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, Card became a legislative fellow with Senator Bill Brock of Tennessee. Cards own experience in being denied a credit card and home mortgage fueled her desire to work on legislation prohibiting discrimination in granting credit to women. Senator Brock served on both the National Commission on Consumer Finance and the Senate Banking Committee, but he and others had to be convinced that a problem existed before supporting federal legislation to address the discrimination. Card coordinated with womens organizations including the National Organization of Women to compile a report on gender-based discrimination in the banking industry that was supported by thousands of letters from women throughout the United States who had been denied credit.

Playing career   Northern Arizona  Baumann played college football for the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision FCS from 2010 to 2013. He was considered one of the top running backs in the FCS that year. While at Northern Arizona, he rushed for at least 1,000 yards for all four years of his eligibility, including 1,456 yards and 10 touchdowns as a senior.

He was signed on December 16, 2014. On May 5, 2015, he was released by the Cardinals. In the preseason of 2014, Bauman scored a touchdown on what was called the most bizarre TD of early NFL preseason in a game against the Minnesota Vikings. The play highlighted the rule that the centers snap to the quarterback is considered a backward pass and not a handoff, therefore the dropped ball was not a fumble and could be advanced. Bauman picked up the ball from the turf and ran it six yards for a touchdown. Bauman participated in The Spring League in 2017.  References",

    "text": "Youngs operation is a surgery designed for the treatment of atrophic rhinitis, first described by Austen Young in 1967.  Procedure  The surgical procedure involves closure of the nasal cavity affected with atrophic rhinitis by creating mucocutaneous flaps. These flaps are sutured together in two layers: first the mucosal layer, then the skin layer. The nasal cavity is kept closed for a period of 6 monthseach; then an examination is done - if the crusts have disappeared, a revision surgery is performed and the nasal cavity is reopened. The theory behind this procedure is that the closed nasal cavity has time to heal.  Outcome  The first patient to undergo Youngs operation specifically to treat Atrophic Rhinitis was in Sheffield in 1963, by Austen Young, when both nostrils were closed. The patient had a chronic condition causing social ostracism due to the strong odour. Both nostrils were re-opened in 1965 and the patient has had no problem since then current as at October 2020. However, the patient has no sense of smell and inhibited taste i.e. cannot taste spicesherbs.  References",

    "text": "The 2002 Giro dItalia was the 85th edition of the Giro dItalia, one of cyclings Grand Tours. The Giro began with a 6.5 km 4 mi prologue that navigated through the streets of the Dutch city Groningen. The race came to a close with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Twenty-two teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Paolo Savoldelli of the Index Alexia team. Second and third were the American Tyler Hamilton and Italian Pietro Caucchioli. In the races other classifications, Ceramiche PanariaFiordo rider Julio Alberto Pérez won the mountains classification, Massimo Strazzer of the Phonak team won the intergiro classification, and Acqua  Sapone rider Mario Cipollini won the points classification. Alessio finished as the winners of the Trofeo Fast Team classification, ranking each of the twenty-two teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the Trofeo Super Team classification, where the teams riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was also won by Alessio.  Teams  A total of 22 teams were invited to participate in the 2002 Giro dItalia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists. Out of the 198 riders that started this edition of the Giro dItalia, a total of 140 riders made it to the finish in Milan. The 22 teams that took part in the race were:  Route and stages  The route for the 2002 Giro dItalia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 17 November 2001 in Milan. It contained three time trial events, all of which were individual. In the stages containing categorized climbs, four had summit finishes: stage 5, to Limone Piemonte; stage 11, to Campitello Matese; stage 13, to San Giacomo; and stage 17, to Passo Coe. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous years race, the race was 1.5 km 1 mi shorter, contained one more rest day, and one more individual time trial. In addition, this race had an opening prologue like the year before.  Classification Leadership  In the 2002 Giro dItalia, five different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclists finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro dItalia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro. Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints. There was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro called the Cima Coppi, which in 2002 was the Passo Pordoi, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs. The fourth jersey represented the intergiro classification, marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. There were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points 20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th for their team. The rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.  Final standings   Minor classifications  Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Italian Massimo Strazzer won the Most Combative classification. The Azzurri dItalia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage.

Early life  MacDonald was born in Springs outside Johannesburg, but grew up in Rhodesia, attending Milton High School.  Rugby career  While farming in Northern Rhodesia, MacDonald represented Rhodesia as a tighthead prop from the late 1950s, with future Springbok Ronnie Hill as his hooker. He was known as a strong scrummager and his appearances for Rhodesia included matches against the 1962 British Lions and 1963 Wallabies. In 1964, MacDonald captained Rhodesia on a tour of South Africa, after which Northern Rhodesia became independent, and he caught the attention of Springboks selectors. He represented the Springboks on their 1965 tour of Australia and New Zealand, debuting against the Wallabies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, then playing all four Test matches in New Zealand. After the tour, MacDonald retired to his tobacco farm in what was now Zambia.  Lion attack  MacDonald was seriously injured in a lion attack on his farm in 1966. A wounded lion MacDonald had been tracking leapt on him, tearing off part of his ear while it tried to crush his head in its jaws. He had three fingers bitten off when he attempted to grab the lions tongue to protect his head, before the lion died of its own injuries. Reports vary on how the lion was killed. One account suggests the lion choked on blood from MacDonald grabbing at its throat, rather than having succumbed to wounds received earlier. After being rushed to hospital, MacDonald required over 400 stitches during a six-hour operation.  Murder  In 1987, MacDonald and his wife Netta were murdered in an ambush at the entrance of their farm near Bulawayo.  See also  List of South Africa national rugby union players  References",

    "text": "Affirmation: LGBTQ Mormons, Families,  Friends is an international organization for individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, queer, intersex, or same-sex attracted, and their family members, friends, and church leaders who are members or former members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints LDS Church.  History   1970s  Under the name Affirmation: Gay Mormons United, the first Affirmation group was organized on June 11, 1977 in Salt Lake City by Stephan Zakharias formerly Stephen James Matthew Price and a group of other Mormon and former-Mormon gays and lesbians at the conference for the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights. Stephan organized the group in response to the suicides of two Brigham Young University students who had undergone shock aversion therapy on the campus. The original organization struggled to survive until 1978, when Paul Mortensen, inspired by an article on the group in The Advocate, formed the Los Angeles chapter. Through the influence of the Los Angeles chapter, Affirmation groups began appearing in many cities around the US.Signs saying BYU alumni and Gay Mormon were held aloft by the Affirmation group at the 1979 Los Angeles Pride Parade in what was called the first out gay Mormon presence at a pride parade. One of the participants was interviewed on camera wearing a BYU jersey.  1980s1990s  Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, it was a common LDS Church practice to excommunicate individuals who identified as gay, without distinguishing between attraction and behavior. A book by former LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, counseled individuals with same-sex attraction that they could overcome same-sex oriented sexuality through faithful living. Because of the strong emphasis in Mormon theology on marriage of a man and a woman as a requirement for exaltation in heaven, it was common for LDS leaders to encourage members who confessed feelings of same-sex attraction to ignore their feelings and marry a member of the opposite sex based on the belief that this would overcome homosexuality. In the 1980s and 1990s, Affirmation increasingly became an organization for ex-Mormons. Members and leaders of Affirmation tended to assume that activity in the LDS Church was psychologically damaging, and believed that the focus of the organization should be on helping people to transition out of Mormonism and to protest policies and doctrines of the LDS Church that were seen as harmful to gay people. 1980  The name was changed to Affirmation: Gay  Lesbian Mormons. 1980  Affirmation leaders sought to engage LDS Church leadership but these early attempts at dialog were rebuffed by LDS Church leadership. 1985  A small number of members of Affirmation formed a Latter Day Saint church for gays and lesbians known as the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ. 1998  In the late 1990s, then-current LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley spoke publicly about gay and lesbian issues in a different way than his predecessors, most famously in an interview on Larry King Live. He used the terms gay and lesbian and refrained from using harsh rhetoric. He also distinguished between gay or lesbian orientation and behavior, and suggested that gay and lesbian individuals could be members of the church in good standing, so long as they refrained from same-sex sexual activity.  2000s  With a softening of the churchs positions on homosexuality, increasing numbers of Affirmation members were choosing to stay active in and engaged. In the early 2000s, chapters of Affirmation formed in Mexico and in Chile. With the resurgence in the 2010s, Affirmation began to experience new growth in Latin America, with chapters opening in Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Brazil. Affirmation quadrupled in active membership. Large numbers of parents and other family members and allies of LGBT individuals began to get involved in the organization. With the participation of entire families, LGBT Mormon teens and youth were a growing segment of the groups membership. Affirmation increasingly took advantage of social media to create community for LGBT Mormons. 2004  Hinckley acknowledged the possibility that sexual orientation could be innate and determined at birth in another interview. 2006  LDS apostle Dallin H. Oaks and member of the Quorum of the Seventy Lance Wickman acknowledged that sexual orientation might not be amenable to change through therapy or personal righteousness, distanced the LDS Church from reparative therapy, and counseled against heterosexual marriage as a therapeutic step.  2010s  2011  Affirmation held its annual international conference in Kirtland, Ohio, an important Mormon historic site, and many Affirmation members experienced the Kirtland conference as a kind of Mormon spiritual revival. 2012  Randall Thacker was elected president of Affirmation, emphasizing the idea that individu",

    "text": "The Kneisel Quartet was a string quartet founded in 1885 by violinist Franz Kneisel, then concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It continued to perform until 1917, and was generally considered the leading string quartet of its time in the United States.  Origin and history  The Kneisel Quartet was founded in 1885, soon after Franz Kneisel arrived in Boston as concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The original members of the quartet were all members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and this remained true, in spite of changes in personnel, until 1903, when the players resigned from the orchestra in order to devote their time and energy exclusively to chamber music. In 1905 they moved from Boston to New York City, where Kneisel had accepted a position at the recently created Institute of Musical Art now the Juilliard School of Music. The quartet gave its final performance on 3 April 1917 in New York. In a statement announcing their retirement, Kneisel explained that henceforth he planned to devote himself to teaching and he wanted to avoid any decline in the quality of their performances.  Personnel  First Violin: Franz Kneisel 18851917 Second violin: Emanuel Fiedler 18851887 Otto Roth 18871899 Karel Ondříček 18991902 Julius Theodorowicz 19021907 Julius Röntgen 19071912 Hans Letz 19121917 Viola: Louis Svećenski 18851917 Cello: Fritz Giese 18851889 Anton Hekking 18891891 Alwin Schroeder 18911907 Willem Willeke 19071917  Repertoire and reputation  The Kneisel Quartet played an important role in the growth of appreciation for chamber music in the United States, and in the spread of European standards of performance and programming. The quartet adopted an uncompromisingly serious approach in their playing and choice of repertoire, making no concessions to public ignorance. In place of the popular selections and excerpts from larger works that many audiences were familiar with, they regularly played complete quartets by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and they introduced to American audiences many compositions that are now part of the classical repertoire, but were then new and unfamiliar, including works by Brahms, Dvořák, Smetana, Franck, Debussy, Ravel, and Schoenberg. They also played many contemporary works by American composers, such as Edward MacDowell, Arthur Foote, and George Chadwick, and were exceptionally supportive of the work of women composers and musicians, such as Amy Beach and Bertha Tapper, with whom they sometimes performed. The quartet toured widely and gave concerts in small towns across North America that had rarely, if ever, heard a professional instrumental ensemble playing serious works from the chamber repertoire. It was occasionally criticized for not playing more accessible music, and even in Boston and New York its concerts were not always well attended, but by the time of its retirement the Kneisel Quartet was widely credited with having created a more educated and appreciative audience for chamber music in the United States. As the New York critic Richard Aldrich wrote in 1917, The interest in chamber music, the appreciation of the highest possibilities of its performance, the knowledge of many of the greatest compositions in this form of art were cultivated to the highest point by the Kneisel Quartet. There were earlier workers in the field, pioneers to whom honor and credit are due, and who shall not be forgotten. But the Kneisel Quartet reached a higher level than was attained by any of them, and has exercised a correspondingly greater influence. It has been one of the greatest forces for good in the musical history of this country.  Selected first performances  Brahms, String Quintet No. 2. First American performance, 6 November 1891.

History  It was first gazetted as the Kwinana Land District on 13 June 1906. It was renamed on 22 August 1956 to Easton in order to avoid confusion with the new Kwinana industrial development south of Perth. The new name honoured William Easton, who in 1921 was the first European to traverse the Mitchell Plateau and led a state government expedition into the North Kimberley area.  References",

    "text": "Information activism at libraries and among librarians began in the 1960s, when many libraries advocated for the information rights of their clients. Their activism projects thereafter extended beyond library walls to advocate for issues such as tenancy and labour rights. With the advent of new information technologies and the information explosion of the late 20th century, information activism expanded in scope to include people who utilize information in the service of advocacy. An information activist is someone who works to make information available to the general population. According to Anthony Molaro, An information activist is a vigorous advocate of knowledge gained through study, communication, research or instruction. Tactical Technology Collective has proposed a definition of information activism as the strategic and deliberate use of information within a campaign which specifically refers to the use of publicly available information in activist projects. Information activists take on many projects to work to remove barriers and provide access to knowledge for all people. Information activism can take on many different forms and be used in many different fields including in librarianship, in archiving, and in activist projects.  In librarianship  Carla Hayden was quoted describing librarians of today as people who are activists, engaged in the social work aspect of librarianship ... Now we are fighters for freedom, and we cause trouble! We are not sitting quietly anymore.  Library Juice Press  Library Juice Press is a publisher that specializes in theoretical and practical issues in librarianship from a critical perspective, for an audience of professional librarians and students of library science. They began as the webzine and blog Library Juice and still hold no affiliations to an academic institution. Some topics they investigate are: library philosophy, information policy, library activism, and in general anything that can be placed under the rubric of critical studies in librarianship. Library Juice Press is an imprint of Litwin Books, LLC.  In archiving  Interference Archive is a collectively-run archive in Brooklyn, New York that opened in December 2011. The Archive explores the relationship between cultural production and social movements. They are a volunteer driven archive whose mission is to bring attention to and honour the history of activist movements, which are often ignored by mainstream institutions. Their collection includes books, prints, music, moving images, and ephemera that were produced by various social movements. Since 2011, Interference Archive has expanded their collection of activist materials, hosted sixteen public exhibitions, written four publications, given over one hundred talks and workshops, and held various film screenings.  In activist projects  The Tactical Technology Collective is an nongovernmental organization that works to advance the use of information and digital technologies by advocates and activists worldwide The organization runs a number of information activism projects including the 10 Tactics for Turning Information into Action, 10 Tactics Revisited, and the Info Activism Camp. Their two 10 Tactics campaigns are both a film and a project which aims to link the ways in which information and information technologies have been used in social movements. In particular, information is used to monitor the state, corporations, and powerful social institutions, hold them accountable, and promote local and global activism. The Info Activism Camp exists as space to bring together activists from around the world to develop information activism techniques.

The text, written on purple dyed vellum in silver ink as are codices a b e f i, is a version of the old Latin. Dated by paleographists to the beginning of the 6th century, the manuscript is formed by 72 sheep leather scrolls with parts in gold or silver characters, and precious miniatures realized in Tyrian purple dye, firstly scanned as a whole in 2018. The best conserved sections contain Luke 24 and 292 verses of John 1:38-3:23; 3:33-5:20; 6:29-49.49-67; 6:68-7:32; 8:6-9:21, written two columns on a page, in round letters. John 18:36-20:14 was written by another hand. It has numerous lacunae. The manuscript was discovered in 1872 in the Church of Sarezzano, near Tortona. It was edited by librarian of the Ambrosian Library in 1872 at Milan 2nd edition, 1885. It was edited by Jülicher. The codex is no longer housed at the Church of Saints Ruffino  Venanzio at Sarezzano, but is kept and displayed at the nearby Museo Diocesano dArte Sacra di Tortona Tortona Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art, in Tortona, Alessandria Province.

    "text": "The Dongfeng-26 or DF-26 simplified Chinese: 东风-26; traditional Chinese: 東風-26; lit. East Wind-26; NATO reporting name: CH-SS-18 is an intermediate-range ballistic missile of the Dongfeng series deployed by the Peoples Liberation Army Rocket Force and produced by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation CASC. Chinese sources claim the DF-26 has a range of over 5,000 km 3,100 mi and may conduct precision nuclear or conventional strikes against ground and naval targets. It is Chinas first conventionally-armed ballistic missile claimed to be capable of reaching Guam and the American military installations located there; this has led to the missile being referred to as the Guam Express or Guam Killer. The possibility that a DF-26 unit could have nuclear warheads makes it likely an adversary would target these missiles in a first strike. This weapon advances military goals from a brinkmanship policy to a calibrated escalation. The missile was officially revealed at the 2015 China Victory Day Parade. In April 2018, it was officially confirmed that the DF-26 was in service with the Peoples Liberation Army Rocket Force PLARF. The United States believes the missile was first fielded in 2016, with 16 operational launchers in 2017.  Tests and deployments  On 26 August 2020, along with a DF-21D, a DF-26B was launched into an area of the South China Sea between Hainan and the Paracel Islands, one day after China said that an American U-2 spy plane entered a no-fly zone without its permission during a Chinese live-fire naval drill in the Bohai Sea off its north coast the US confirmed a U-2 sortie but denied it was improper. and came as Washington blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military activities in the South China Sea. US officials subsequently claimed that the Peoples Liberation Army Rocket Force PLARF had fired four medium-range ballistic missiles in total. The missile tests drew criticism from Japan, the Pentagon and Taiwan and led to volatility in Asian markets. As of 2019, the DF-26 has not been tested against targets at sea. A missile test range located in Chinas Taklamakan Desert is used for the development of the DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missile. The facility, which is a component of the Peoples Liberation Armys anti-accessarea denial A2AD strategy, includes full-scale mock-ups of U.S. naval assets, such as a Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers . Some of these targets are mounted on rail systems to simulate movement. This test site is used to refine the DF-26s guidance systems and terminal-stage sensors, supporting its capability to engage and destroy naval vessels.

The town population was 12,968 at the 2020 census, up from 12,671 at the 2010 census.  History  A charter for a Township of Kingsbury was granted by King George III on May 11, 1762. It was named after a small parish on the western outskirts of London. Its first settler was James Bradshaw. Albert Baker arrived second, constructing a sawmill at what is today known as Bakers Falls. John Jones built a mill in the northwest corner of town. Following his death, Edward Patten purchased Jones land and renamed the settlement Pattens Mills, a name by which it is still known. During the American Revolutionary War, General John Burgoyne and his troops passed through the town after the Battle of Fort Anne. In 1780, Major Christopher Carleton led a raid that set fire to everything but the homes of Loyalists. Charlotte County, of which Kingbury was a part, was annexed by the Vermont Republic in 1781. The following year, it renounced its claim to Charlotte County, and New York officially recognized the town of Kingsbury. In 1810, the settlement near Bakers Falls incorporated as the village of Sandy Hill, though it changed its name to Hudson Falls in 1910. In 1823, the Champlain Canal was opened, followed in 1833 by the Glens Falls Feeder Canal. Major industry consisted of farming, milling, mining, and logging. Limestone was produced at Smiths Basin.

These 17 species of beetles are flightless, and are endemic to South Africa, each restricted to its own mountain range or peak within a range mostly between 1000 and 2000 m elevation. Dead specimens are highly prized by beetle collectors. As a result of commercial pressure, Colophon beetles have been placed on CITES Appendix III. This means international import and export of Colophon species is regulated. Limited reference specimens may only be collected for scientific purposes with the appropriate permit issued by the Department of Western Cape Nature Conservation.

    "text": "Ysbeidiau Heulog pronounced əsˈbəidiaɨ ˈhəɨlɔɡ; English: Sunny Intervals is the twelfth single by Super Furry Animals. It was the only single to be taken from the album Mwng and was released as a limited edition 7 vinyl on the bands own Placid Casual label on 1 May 2000. It was the bands first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. The Welsh language song has been described by singer Gruff Rhys as throwaway pop and likened to the music of ELO, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Critical reaction to the track was generally positive with some reviewers comparing the song to the work of Roxy Music. The track appears on 2004s singles compilation album Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1 but is not included on the DVD release as no music video was made.  Themes and recording  Singer Gruff Rhys has described Ysbeidiau Heulog as throwaway pop ... old time pop music, likening the song to the work of ELO and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 1960s pop bands such as The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment and that If theres any song that doesnt sum up Mwng its Ysbeidiau Heulog! The track was recorded in 1999 at Famous Studios, Cardiff and was engineered by Greg Haver. Overdubs were added at Ofn studios, Llanfaelog, Wales with the help of Gorwel Owen who also mixed the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. B-side Charge was recorded for an episode of BBC Radio 1s The John Peel Show, which aired on 1 March 2000. The track was produced for the BBC by Simon Askew and engineered by Nick Fountain.  Musical structure  Ysbeidiau Heulog is 2 minutes 51 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody, which plays twice, accompanied by drums, bass, distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone. The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines Fe gawsom ni, ysbeidiau heulog, ysbeidiau heulog with a vocoder being used on the second ysbeidiau heulog. This entire phrase is then repeated, with Rhys accompanied by harmony backing vocals. Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums. The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar, playing the chords B, B, A and E twice with little sustain, joining the drums and bass, which is no longer distorted. The track breaks down for the first chorus with Rhys singing ysbeidiau heulog four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional keyboard noises with the band rejoining on the last heulog, the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the words two syllables which are emphasised by cymbal crashes. After a drum fill an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds. This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once during the second half of the section, simply feedingback for the first half. The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhys vocals. A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing Oedd ein cariad ni, heulog tan ddaeth glaw yn llif. Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar, featuring flanging, playing several licks alongside bass and drums, which are heavily affected by flanging. The bridge leads into the third and last chorus, which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature flanging. The track ends with an instrumental outro similar to the intro. The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a wah-wah effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone. After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to fade out.  Release and critical response  Ysbeidiau Heulog was released as a limited edition 7 vinyl single on the Super Furry Animals own Placid Casual label on 1 May 2000. It was the bands first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. It received a generally positive response from critics. The track was awarded Single of the Week in the May 1016, 2000 issue of the Melody Maker by guest reviewers the Dum Dums who gave the song a perfect five-star rating and claimed that it is a summery, karaoke-pop hit. Pitchfork Media called Ysbeidiau Heulog the best track on parent album Mwng and described it as a decidedly retro number that combines the swingin sounds of the 60s with some high-tech vocal effects. In a 2006 feature on the Super Furry Animals back catalogue Incendiary Magazine called the track a clever slice of pop. In a play on words on the tracks meaning in English, Drowned in Sound stated that Ysbeidiau Heulog was Mwngs sunny interv",

    "text": "Chrispim Jacques Bias Fortes 25 October 1847  14 March 1917, often referred to as Bias Fortes, was a Brazilian politician and prosecutor who served as president of Minas Gerais in the early years of the First Brazilian Republic. During his administration the new state capital, Belo Horizonte, was inaugurated in 1897, replacing Ouro Preto.  Early life and education  The son of Francisco José de Oliveira Fortes, a captain in Brazils National Guard, and Carlota Benedita de Oliveira Fortes, Bias Fortes was born on 25 October 1847 in the Livramento currently the municipality of Olivera Fortes, Minas Gerais. His name is a homage to Saint Crispin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Greek philosopher Bias of Priene. Bias Fortes completed his first studies in Barbacena and later moved to São Paulo to study at the Faculty of Law, where he graduated in Legal and Social Sciences in 1870, alongside Joaquim Nabuco, Ruy Barbosa, Afonso Pena and Rodrigues Alves. After finishing his studies at the Faculty of Law, Bias Fortes returned to Minas Gerais, where he began to work as an attorney in Barbacena. In October 1871, he was appointed public prosecutor in the district of Parahybuna and later became a municipal judge in Barbacena. Bias Fortes married Adelaide de Araújo, who was the daughter of major João Manoel de Araújo, an important figure in the Liberal rebellions of 1842. Together they had 3 children: José Francisco, who would later become governor of Minas Gerais, Maria Alice, and Laurita.  Political career   Provincial deputy  In 1879, Bias Fortes requested his dismissal from his office as magistrate and began his political career, joining the Liberal Party. In 1881, he was elected provincial deputy of Minas Gerais for the remainder of the 23rd legislature 18801881, being successively reelected until the 27th legislature 18881889. During this period, he occupied the position of president of the Provincial Assembly several times, distinguishing himself in the defense of Minas Gerais interests and the moralization of public administration. Amidst the growing republican movement in the Brazilian Empire in the 1880s, Bias Fortes declared himself a republican and resigned his position as provincial deputy in 1888, before the end of the 27th legislature. The next year he once again ran for the position. However, despite receiving a considerable number of votes, he was prevented from taking office due to the coup détat that proclaimed the republic in Brazil. At that time, Bias Fortes had already joined the Republican Party of Minas Gerais PRM, founded in 1888.  President of Minas Gerais  With the republic in place, Bias Fortes was invited by state president João Pinheiro to create the draft for the states constitution. Shortly after, he was appointed provisional president governor of Minas Gerais by president Deodoro da Fonseca, serving consecutively from 24 July to 5 August 1890, 14 August to 3 October 1890, 18 October to 27 December 1890, and 7 January to 11 February 1891, being succeeded by Frederico Augusto Álvares da Silva. Bias Fortes was elected to the Minas Gerais Constituent Assembly on 25 January 1891, directly acting in the creation of the state constitution. He also served as president of the State Senate from 1891 to 1893. In 1894, Bias Fortes resigned his position in the Senate after being elected president of Minas Gerais on 7 March and taking office on 7 September, succeeding Afonso Pena. As president of Minas Gerais, Bias Fortes sought to promote agriculture, immigration, and the settlement of interior lands. He also reformed agricultural and veterinary teaching and invested in railway construction. On 12 December 1897, Bias Fortes inaugurated the new state capital, Belo Horizonte, replacing Ouro Preto.  Final years and death  Bias Fortes was succeeded by Silviano Brandão on 7 September 1898. That year he assumed the presidency of the PRMs executive committee, known as Tarasca, a position he held until 1917. Bias Fortes died in Barbacena on 14 March 1917 during his office as state senator.  Homages  Bias Fortes lends his name to several avenues and squares in Belo Horizonte and Barbacena. In Belo Horizontes Liberdade Square there is a monument in his honor. Likewise, in the citys Municipal Park there is a monument to the founders of Belo Horizonte, which includes Bias Fortes, alongside Augusto de Lima, Afonso Pena and Aarão Reis.

    "text": "Dream Away is a song by the English rock musician George Harrison written for the film Time Bandits 1981, and subsequently released on his tenth studio album Gone Troppo 1982. The song is featured over the end credits of Time Bandits, a production of Harrisons HandMade Films directed by Terry Gilliam. Dream Away was also issued as a single in Japan in February 1983.  Background  Dream Away was to originally appear on a planned Time Bandits soundtrack album. When that failed to materialise and Harrison was finalising the tracks for his Gone Troppo album, he decided to include Dream Away. In the documentary film George Harrison: Living in the Material World 2011, directed by Martin Scorsese, Gilliam recalled that late in the production of Time Bandits he came to see the songs lyrics as notes from Harrison on the things he liked and disliked about the film and on how Gilliam was too arrogant and not listening! Gilliam added: And I thought it was the most brilliant, subtle, clever thing a man could ever do, to write a song. Hes writing about things that he felt strongly about and yet hes too polite and decent and, I think, respectful of other artists, whatever form that takes, to interfere.  Release and critical reception  Although Gone Troppo was a commercial failure, Dream Away became a popular tune. People magazines reviewer paired it with Wake Up My Love as the albums two lovelies and commented that Because of his forays into the mystical, Harrisons penchant for whimsy often gets overlooked. But here the zany side gets no short shrift. Writing in Goldmine magazine shortly after Harrisons death in November 2001, Dave Thompson said that while Gone Troppo was a far from essential album by the artist, Dream Away was a track that stands alongside any number of Harrisons minor classics. In 2010, AOL Radio listeners voted Dream Away at number 8 on the stations list of the 10 Best George Harrison Songs.

    "text": "The music of Greenland is a mixture of two primary strands, Inuit and Danish, mixed with influences from the United States and United Kingdom. Greenlands musical character has been described as definitely a rock country, both musically and literally according to Greenlandic drummer Hans Rosenberg. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes all Greenlandic music except the drum dances as influenced by external styles.  Folk music  The Inuit and the Danish peoples of Greenland have both maintained their distinct styles of folk music. Country-wide folk traditions included storytelling, which declined greatly after the introduction of the South Greenland Printing Press in 1857. Traditional music which has best survived European contact can be found in the east and northeast of the island. It includes sacred drum dances played on an oval drum made of a wooden frame with a bear-bladder on top. Drum dances are the only truly indigenous music in Greenland, and are part of a roots revival in modern times. Shamans used drums as part of their religious affairs and sometimes organized singing duels between rivals in which the performer who got the most laughs from the audience won. Inuit drum dances were a declining tradition and in modern Greenland are being replaced by amateur theater groups like Silamiut, who used elements of indigenous music with masks, face painting and other techniques. Piseq are a form of personal song that comment on daily life; these are often handed down from generation to generation. Greenlandic Inuit folk songs are performed to tell stories, play games and tease or charm others.  Inuit music  The Inuit of Greenland share a musical tradition with related peoples across the Canadian territories of the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, as well as the US state of Alaska and part of eastern Russia. Greenlandic Inuit are part of the Eastern Arctic group; the Eastern Arctic Inuit of Canada and Alaska are part of the same music area as the Central Arctic Inuit, as opposed to the distinct styles of the Western Inuit. Greenlandic Inuit music is largely based around singing and drums, the latter being generally reserved for large celebrations and other gatherings. Though there is much folk vocal music, there is no Inuit purely instrumental tradition with no accompaniment by singing or dancing. Greenlandic drums are mostly frame drums made of animal skin stretched over a wooden frame and decorated with decorative and symbolic motifs by the drummer. Aside from drums, whistles, bull-roarers and buzzers are also widespread, and the jaw harp and fiddle are both found, most likely recent imports. Historical recordings of this music are done since 1905. This traditional Greenlandic music is performed also today.  Drum dances  Greenlandic drum dances are, like the relatives found in Eastern and Central Canada, based around a single dancer who composes songs sung by his family while he dances, usually in a qaggi, a snow-house built just for community events such as the drum dance. The mens drum dancing skills are evaluated by his endurance in his lengthy performance and the nature of his compositions. Drum dances are an important element of Greenlandic Inuit cultural cohesion, and function as personal expression, pure entertainment and social sanction. Many drum dances are competitive in nature, featuring two song cousins who humorously sing and dance, while pointing out the flaws in the other. This is generally a light-hearted, convivial event, but is also sometimes used to settle serious duels between warring families or individuals; the jokes are prepared ahead of time and the person who evokes the most laughter from the audience is considered the victor.  Other Inuit folk song traditions  Many Inuit folk games revolve around song as well, including string games, hide-and-seek, juggling and rhymes and riddles. The katajjaq tradition is also well-known; it is a vocal contest between two women, standing facing each other. They sing songs, using throat-singing and imitating animal cries or other sounds. Katajjaq is a game, but is often stopped because both women begin laughing. In addition to the drum dance and game songs, Greenlandic Inuit have a tradition of piseq piserk, personal song songs. These are expressive, spiritual, superstitious or narrative and may be composed for drum dances. Piseq and other vocal traditions aside from song games include a number of styles and tones, which vary depending on the social context of the performance. For example, a soft vocal tone is used both for character illustration in a narrative song and for personal songs in private settings. Many songs use only a few real words, interspersed among numerous vocables, or non-lexical syllables like ai-ya-yainga. Inuit songs are strophic and mostly use six different pitches; textual and melodic motifs are common. A songs word length and accentuation determines the rhy",

    "text": "Illegal Petes is a Colorado-based group of quick-service, fast-casual Mission Style burrito restaurants that takes inspiration from burritos popularized in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s.  History  The first Illegal Petes location was opened up by Pete Turner on August 15, 1995, on The Hill in Boulder; Turner said that starting the business nearly killed him. Since then, the business has grown to include seven locations in Denver, two in Boulder, one in Fort Collins, and two in Arizona, one in Tucson and one in Tempe. Turner seeks old, historic buildings to transform into his locations and has done so with places like Mamas Cafe, and the vintage shop at Main Gate. The corporate headquarters of Illegal Petes was in the historic Denver landmark, the Daniels  Fisher Tower in downtown Denver and now is located in a loft on Broadway near their S. Broadway restaurant. The restaurant has become popular with hipsters, college students, athletes, and musicians nationwide: in fact, international pop songwriter Jack Johnson first received the call saying Universal Records wanted to sign him while he was eating a burrito at Illegal Petes. In 2014, Illegal Petes attracted controversy from proponents of Race Forwards Drop the I-Word campaign, which seeks to eliminate the word illegal from American vernacular because of possible racial connotations. Two small groups of Latino activists demanded that the word illegal be dropped from the name of the restaurant, first in Fort Collins and again upon the opening of the Tucson location. Founder Pete Turner has refuted any possible racial connotations of his business name in the media and in a public statement defending the use of the word.  Culture  Illegal Petes is involved in several facets of community involvement, including charity fund raisers like the Smother Autism campaign in April 2012, which raised money for The Joshua School, a Colorado-based, non-profit educational therapeutic day treatment center for children with an autism spectrum disorder and related developmental disabilities, or the award-winning Petes Pints campaigns, which raise money for local bands. In September 2010, Illegal Petes started the Starving Artist program, which feeds out-of-town musicians for free at Illegal Petes when they come through Denver or Boulder to play a show. Illegal Petes was voted as the Best Place to Eat and Hang Out with Rock Stars by the annual Best of Westword of 2011. Illegal Petes began throwing Starving Artist SXSW showcases in Austin in March 2011. Pete Turner was featured in a front-page article of the Denver Post on businesses spending marketing money on representing Denver at SXSW. In July 2011, Illegal Petes launched Greater Than artist collective, a non-traditional record label that works with Colorado bands. The label was the brain child of Pete Turner and Suburban Home Records owner for 17 years, Virgil Dickerson. Bands signed to the label included Denver darkwave band Snake Rattle Rattle Snake, cello prog pop songwriter Ian Cooke, active rock Denver darlings The Epilogues, the belovedly crass comedian Ben Roy, and songstress Esmé Patterson. Travel Channels Food Paradise aired a segment August 26, 2014 about the restaurant.  References   External links  Official website",

    "text": "Elizabeth was an American psychedelic rockprogressive rock band that were active from 1967 to 1970. They were based out of Philadelphia and known for their unique musical and sonic blend of baroque, classical, folk, American rock, British rock, country, and ragtime. Elizabeths members were: Steve Weingarten lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, who died in 2007; Bob Patterson rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals; Jim Dahme flute, lead and backing vocals; Steve Paul Bruno bass, organ, backing vocals; and, Hank Ransome drums.  History  In 1968, the band recorded and released their self-titled album on Vanguard Records produced by Sam Charters. Vanguards artist roster at the time included Joan Baez, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Country Joe and the Fish. Elizabeth performed with Cream, Blue Cheer, Joni Mitchell, Ritchie Havens, The Chambers Brothers and many other musical luminaries of that era. Some of the bands many Philadelphia area performances included concerts and sets at: The Main Point, The Second Fret, The Electric Factory, and most Be-INs at Belmont Plateau in Philadelphias Fairmount Park. As the band was starting to come together nameless at that point, Steve and Robert Stewkey Antoni, bandmates from Newport, RI, made an unexpected stop in Philadelphia on their way to Florida. After a week in the City of brotherly love, they decided to forgo Florida and help form Elizabeth. Some interesting guitarists auditioned for the band, including future rock star Todd Rundgren who was with Woodys Truck Stop at the time; and, Nick Jameson, soon to be a founder and guitarist of The American Dream both were Philly bands. Within a month or so of landing in Philadelphia, Stewkey left Elizabeth to join Todds new band, The Nazz. Of note, Linda Cohen, a Philadelphia classical guitarist, was Elizabeths first drummer briefly. During the spring and summer of 1969, she teamed up with Michael Kac from Mandrake Memorial and, together, performed as a classical-pop fusion guitar-harpsichord duo. Linda died in 2009 of lung cancer. Mandrake Memorial and Elizabeth shared the stage many times.  Post-Elizabethan life  After Elizabeth disbanded in 1970, the bands members pursued various musical and non-musical endeavors. Hank went on to play with the group Good God. Steve began a recordingengineering career that kicked off at Vanguard and Electric Lady Studios. Bob moved to Florida and is quite active to this day as a Singer, Songwriter, Storyteller and Visual Artist. Linda Cohen recorded 3 albums 1971-1973 that were produced by Craig Anderton from Mandrake Memorial. Stewkey recorded 3 albums with The Nazz 1968-1971. The Elizabeth album was re-mastered from the original tapes and re-released on CD in 2000 by the Akarma Vanguard label. The release comes housed in a mini album-styled sleeve that perfectly reproduces the original records foldout cover graphics. The popular Elizabeth track, You Should Be More Careful, appears on the 2010 Vanguard album release 2-disk vinyl set entitled Follow Me Down: Vanguards Lost Psychedelic Era 1966-1970 along with tracks by The Vagrants, The 31st of February and other Vanguard artists.

    "text": "Herborn Dillkreis station is a railway station in the town of Herborn in the German state of Hesse on the Dill Railway built as part of the former DeutzGießen railway. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn DB as a category 4 station.  History  The station was built as a station on the DeutzGießen railway. Services over the whole line commenced on 12 January 1862.  Entrance building  The entrance building was built in the Renaissance Revival style and is built next to the post office and the two buildings together dominate the station forecourt. The design is by the architect Ludwig Hoffmann. The building was built in 1908 after a great fire in 1904 and replaced the original building of 1862. The station building of 1908 is thus a building of the second generation of structural engineering on the line. It had become necessary because the old station building was no longer sufficient with the opening of two branch lines. The station building is built to an asymmetrical floor plan. It is dominated by a rugged, slate-covered roof. On the street side is the facade with eccentrically mounted, large arched windows dominated by an outstanding Renaissance Revival gable. This is the location of the entrance from the street. The station building is now listed as a monument under the Hessian Heritage Act. The station building is still partly occupied by a restaurant and a retail kiosk. Tickets can be purchased at the kiosk and from vending machines. The station building has been extensively refurbished since 2015.  Operations  The station has a home platform next to the station building and an island platform with two faces. Another island platform together with two tracks, previously served traffic on two now disused branch lines, which were adjacent to the east. The tracks have been dismantled and the area now forms an industrial wasteland. Today, the station is served by Regional-Express trains on the SiegenGießenFrankfurt route Main-Sieg-Express, RE 99 and Regionalbahn services on the Dillenburg-Frankfurt route Mittelhessen-Express, RB 40, running as stopping trains between Dillenburg and Gießen. The public transport is operated under contract to the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV by DB Regio and Hessische Landesbahn. Previously the station was served by two other lines: services on the Aar-Salzböde railway from Niederwalgern started and ended here from 1902 to 2001, services on the Cross Westerwald Railway Westerwaldquerbahn to Montabaur started and ended here from 1906 to 1980. The station is no longer staffed.  Notes   References  Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Hessen, ed. 2005. Eisenbahn in Hessen. Kulturdenkmäler in Hessen.

    "text": "The Fazil examination is a government examination held in Aliya Madrasas in Bangladesh and India. The Fazil exam is an examination equivalent to a degree, sometimes equivalent to a bachelors degree, in Bangladesh, which is held in a Fazil Madrasa. However, in India, the Fazil exam is considered the standard of the higher secondary level 11th or 12th class. The Fazil exam is common in government-recognized Aliya Madrasas in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The Fazil exam in Bangladesh is held under the Islamic Arabic University and the Fazil exam in India is held under the West Bengal Board of Madrasah Education.  History  Before the transfer of Dhaka Aliya Madrasa to Dhaka in 1947, the Fazil examination of Bangladesh and India was held under the Calcutta Aliya Madrasa. The Fazil examination is currently held under the Islamic Arabic University. It was previously held under the Madrasa Board and the Islamic University. When Madrasa-e-Alia was transferred to Dhaka in 1948, the Fazil examinations of the Madrasa Board were accepted by the Dhaka University. On the recommendation of the Qudrat-e-Khuda Education Commission in 1975, the national curriculum and multi-faceted curriculum were introduced in the Aliya Madrasas controlled by the Madrasa Board. This curriculum was implemented in the Fazil examination held in 1980. According to this education commission, the Fazil examination was declared equivalent to the general higher secondary H.S.C. by including Islamic education in the Fazil category along with the general curriculum. In 1978, the Senior Madrasa Education System Committee was formed under the leadership of Professor Mustafa Bin Kasim. Under the guidance of this committee, the level of Alia Madrasa education controlled by the Bangladesh Madrasa Board was aligned with the general education level in 1984. The Fazil level was upgraded to a 2-year course, introducing a complete modern education system of Alia Madrasa lasting a total of 16 years. It was through this commission that the government declared the Fazil examination as the general degree standard.  University affiliation  Until 2006, all the examinations of all Aliya Madrasas in Bangladesh were controlled by the Bangladesh Madrasa Education Board. According to the Islamic Universities Amendment Act, 2006, the Fazil Bachelors Degree courses of Aliya Madrasas were planned to be of 2 to 3 years duration. 1,086 Fazil Madrasas Bachelors Degree in Bangladesh were affiliated to the Islamic University of Kushtia. And in some cases, both the Fazil and Kamil examinations are considered equivalent to a full bachelors degree in general education, in some cases only the Fazil examination is considered equivalent to a bachelors degree. Islamic University, Kushtia In 2010, a bachelors degree equivalent course was introduced in 31 notable madrasas in Bangladesh. As a result, students from these 31 madrasas had the opportunity to earn a full bachelors degree by completing only the bachelors degree. At that time, the bachelors degree course was still running in these madrasas. Then, in 2016, the Islamic Arabic University was established to further modernize madrasa education. And then the Alia madrasas were moved there. In 2016, the Islamic Arabic University introduced undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in 21 more madrasas.  References",

    "text": "Ibrahim of Ghazna b. 1033  d. 1099 was sultan of the Ghaznavid empire from April 1059 until his death in 1099. Having been imprisoned at the fortress of Barghund, he was one of the Ghaznavid princes that escaped the usurper Toghruls massacre in 1052. After his brother Farrukh-Zad took power, Ibrahim was sent to the fortress of Nay, the same fortress where the poet Masud Sad Salman would later be imprisoned for ten years. Following Farrukhs death, Ibrahim was recognized as the last surviving male Ghaznavid. A military escort was sent to fetch him from Nay and he entered Ghazna on 6 April 1059. Ibrahims reign was considered a golden age for the Ghaznavid empire, due to the treaties and cultural exchanges with the Great Seljuq empire.  Life  Ibrahim was born during his fathers campaign into Gurgan and Tabaristan c. 1033. He reportedly had 40 sons and 36 daughters. One of these daughters married the great-great-grandfather of the historian Juzjani. Ibrahims son, Masud, married Gawhar Khatun, daughter of Seljuq sultan Malik Shah, as a condition of peace between the Great Seljuq empire and the Ghaznavid empire. Every year Ibrahim would copy the Quran by hand and send it to the caliph in Mecca.  Reign  Ibrahim rebuilt towns and settlements and instituted a vigorous policy for the restoration of social peace and economic prosperity in the Ghaznavid empire, which had been initiated by his brother Farrukh-Zad. At an unknown time, Ibrahim also arrested his vizier Abu Sahl Khujandi for unknown reasons. In 1060, at the request of the nobles of Ghur, Ibrahim invaded the region and deposed its ruler Abbas ibn Shith. He then had the latters son Muhammad ibn Abbas placed on the Ghurid throne. Ibrahim sent his son, Mahmud, with an army of ghazis consisting of 40,000 cavalry to raid Doaba in the eastern Punjab, between 1063 and 1070. Following Mahmuds successful campaigns into India, Ibrahim initially appointed him governor of India. He occupied temporarily the cities of Agra and Kannauj. He also attacked and captured Malwa. However, for reasons unknown, Mahmud fell out of favor, was imprisoned in the fortress of Nay and his brother, Masud, took his place as governor of India. Shorn of its western land, it was increasingly sustained by riches accrued from raids across Northern India, where it faced stiff resistance from Indian rulers such as the Paramara of Malwa and the Gahadvala of Kannauj. After 14 years of peace with the Seljuks, Ibrahim, in January 1073, sent an army into Sakalkand. His army met with initial success, capturing Seljuk sultan Malik Shahs uncle, Usman Chaghri Beg, who was sent to Ghazna. However, an army led by the Seljuk Amir Gumushtegin Bilge Beg and Anushtegin Gharchai, drove out the Ghaznavid army that had devastated Sakalkand. In 10778, Ibrahim appointed Abd al-Hamid Shirazi as his vizier. In 1079, Ibrahim led a campaign into India, besieging a fortress in Pakpattan 120 Parasang 480 miles from Lahore, taking it on 13 August 1079. The military commander at Lahore, Abdul Najam Zarir Shaybani, carried out successful raids against the Hindu cities of Benares, Thanesar, and Kannauj. Another main achievement of Ibrahims reign was the rise of Lahore as a great cultural center under the viceroyalty of his grandson Shirzad.  Death  Ibrahim died on 25 August 1099 ending a reign of 40 years. His tomb lies in the northeastern part of medieval Ghazna near Shaikh Radi d-Din Ali Lalas tomb in the Palace of Sultan Masud III.

Unlike previous competitions, the tournament was divided into two conferences of three teams each, with no interconference matches. Samoa emerged as the winner of the Pacific Islands conference title ahead of Fiji and Tonga, while Japan took out the AsiaPacific conference remaining undefeated ahead of United States and Canada.  Format  Each team played each other once in their respective conferences, with no interconference matches. Four points were awarded for a win, two points for a draw and one point for a bonus point; the bonus point being awarded should a team score four or more tries in a match, or for a loss by seven points or less. The winner of each conferences was the team with the most log points, with tiebreakers being the head to-head results between teams equal on log points, followed points difference for-and-against.

    "text": "Cassius V. Cook 1879 March 1, 1950 was an American anarchist activist, writer and publisher.  Biography  Cook grew up in Iowa before moving to Chicago and then California. He studied pharmacy at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Francisco. He was an associate of Emma Goldman, raising her bond when she was arrested in San Francisco in 1909 after she came to the city for a series of lectures and debates organized by the San Francisco Social Science League, of which Cook was a member. He later accompanied her to Seattle as part of a lecture tour. When the San Francisco Free Speech League was formed after Goldmans arrest, he became its secretary. The involvement of Cook and others in Goldmans defense was said to have invigorated Goldman with a new sense of mission. He contributed writing to Mother Earth and was arrested for opposition to the First World War. He later settled in Vancouver, British Columbia where in 1913 he was secretary-treasurer of the Miners Liberation League and worked for the Dr. Bell Electro Appliance Company from 1913 to 1916 according to city directories. Later in the decade, he edited The Libertarian Magazine in Seattle. In 1919, Cook was head of the Chicago office of the International Workers Defence League and was involved in organizing to free or win a retrial for Thomas Mooney, who had been convicted and sentenced to deathcommuted to life in prisonfor the San Francisco Preparedness Day Bombing. Between the World Wars, Cook was a member of the anarchist Libertarian Society in Los Angeles. He was described as a large, florid, and bombastic man, who wrote resolutions for meetings and conventions. Later in life, he was an advertising executive and secretary of Rocker Publications, which printed and promoted the work of Rudolf Rocker. He was living in Los Angeles when he died on March 1, 1950, and was survived by his wife Sadie, a sister, and two brothers. His death was also noted by a short obituary in the London-based Freedom, an anarchist fortnightly newspaper. His papers are part of the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan.

    "text": "The Seyhan River formerly written Seihan, Sihun; ancient name: Ancient Greek: Σάρος, Sáros, alternatively known as Sarus or in Turkish as Sarus Su, is the longest river of Cilicia and the longest of Turkey that flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The river is 560 kilometres 350 mi long and flows southwest from its headwaters in the Tahtalı-Mountains in Sivas and Kayseri provinces in the Anti-Taurus Mountains to the Mediterranean Sea via a broad delta. Its main tributaries are Zamantı and Göksu, which unite in Aladağ, Adana to form the Seyhan River. The Zamantı River originates from the Uzun Plateau in Pınarbaşı, Kayseri and crosses Tomarza, Develi and Yahyalı districts in Kayseri. Its sources were reported being in the Taurus Mountains in Cataonia. It flowed through Cappadocia by the town of Comana, then through Cilicia. It is noted by numerous ancient authors including Livy, Xenophon, Procopius, Strabo, Ptolemy, Appian, Pliny the Elder, and Eustathius of Thessalonica who erroneously calls it Sinarus. At 50 kilometres 31 mi from its mouth, Seyhan River flows through the city of Adana, the only settlement situated on the river. Several bridges and footbridges cross the river in Adana including the Stone Bridge, a 2nd-century Roman bridge. Ancient city of Augusta was also situated on the river, corresponding today to the east side of the Çatalan reservoir. The river meets the Mediterranean Sea at Cape Deli. Its basin is the mountainous Seyhan Basin.  History  An ancient Greco-Roman legend mentions that the name of the city of Adana originates from Adanus, the son of the Greek god Uranus, who founded the city next to the river with his brother. His brothers name, Sarus, was given to the river. Originally, the River Sarus flowed from the mountains, became the Seyhan River whilst passing through Cilicia and then onwards to the Mediterranean Sea. In 2009, a total of 33 fish species were listed as being found in the Seyhan River, including 29 native, 3 introduced and 4 endemic species. Eight amphibians were listed and two of them Rana holtzi and Triturus vittatus cilicensis are known to be endemic to the river. The major Seyhan Dam upstream of Adana serves for irrigation, hydroelectric power, and flood control. Yedigöze, Çatalan and Kavşak Bendi are the other dams on Seyhan River which also serve the same purposes. The river is currently under extensive development for hydroelectric power and irrigation.

    "text": "Cold Harbor is the tenth episode and season finale of the second season of the American science fiction psychological thriller television series Severance. It is the 19th overall episode of the series and was written by series creator Dan Erickson and directed by executive producer Ben Stiller. It was released on Apple TV on March 20, 2025. The series follows employees of Lumon Industries, a biotechnology corporation that uses a medical procedure called severance to separate the memories of their employees: at work, Lumon employees, called innies, cant remember anything outside of work. Outside work, Lumon employees, called outies, cant remember anything about work. As a result, innies and outies experience two different lives, with distinct personalities and agendas. In the episode, Marks outie and innie move forward with their plan to rescue his wife Gemma from Lumon. Upon its release, Cold Harbor received acclaim for the performances especially Adam Scott, direction, twists, tension, emotional weight, and closure to the season. The episode is considered as one of the best episodes of the series. At the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, Stiller received a nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series whilst Scott submitted the episode to support his Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination.  Plot  In the birthing cabin, Marks outie and innie communicate with each other by recording messages with a camcorder and having Mark walk in and out of the severed room to respond. Marks outie, Devon and Cobel explain the plan to rescue Gemma from the testing floor and use the evidence of her kidnapping to take down Lumon. Marks innie argues that reintegration will result in him losing his identity and autonomy; he grows agitated when he realizes that since Helena would never reintegrate with her innie Helly, taking down Lumon would effectively mean ending Hellys life. Cobel reveals to Marks innie that every MDR file he completes creates a new innie for Gemma, and that Cold Harbor is the last, after which Lumon will extract Gemmas chip from her brain, killing her in the process. When she insists that Mark is merely being used by the Eagans and has no future with Helly, Mark storms off, demanding to reawaken on the severed floor. The next day, Dylan returns to find that his outie has deferred a decision on his resignation request to him, saying his existence makes him feel happy. Mark arrives on the severed floor and completes the Cold Harbor file with Helly by his side. Milchick and an animatronic statue of Kier Eagan congratulate Mark. During the congratulatory ovation to Mark S, Kier Egans Animatronic starts to demoralize Milchick, going as far as calling him Seth. Milchick performs with a marching band from the Choreography  Merriment department. Helly distracts Milchick and traps him in the bathroom while Mark searches for the elevator to the testing floor. Dylan arrives at MDR and helps Helly hold off Milchick by barricading the bathroom door with a vending machine. Gemma enters the Cold Harbor room, where her new innie is tasked with disassembling the crib Mark had built for their baby. To the delight of Dr. Mauer and Jame Eagan, this does not trigger any emotions in her innie. Meanwhile, Lorne brings a goat to a secret room across from the exports hall, where Mr. Drummond is waiting; the goat, chosen for how well it embodies Kiers core principles, is a sacrifice that will be buried alongside Gemma. Drummond provides Lorne with a cattle stunner to kill the goat but is distracted by the sound of Mark attempting to break into the exports hall. Drummond tries to strangle Mark but is stopped by Lorne, who threatens him with the cattle stunner. They fight until Lorne subdues Drummond. Holding Drummond hostage with the cattle stunner, Mark takes him to the elevator down to the testing floor; during the transition to his outie, Mark accidentally activates the cattle stunner, killing Drummond. Marks outie locates the Cold Harbor room, uses his tie soaked in Drummonds blood to enter the room via biometric authentication and frees Gemma. Upon exiting the room, Gemma reverts to her outie and tearfully reunites with Mark. They escape back up to the severed floor, transitioning again to their severed identities. Marks innie guides Ms. Casey to the exit stairwell where she transitions back to Gemma, but he decides not to join her, instead returning to Helly. Gemma cries for Mark as he and Helly run off into the hallways, holding hands.  Production   Development  The episode was written by series creator Dan Erickson, and directed by executive producer Ben Stiller. This marked Ericksons seventh writing credit and Stillers 11th directing credit.  Writing  Dan Erickson said that in an earlier version of the script, they would expand more about the content behind the Cold Harbor file. However, they decided to keep it unknown as the answer to its conte",

    "text": "McGill station is a Montreal Metro and Réseau express métropolitain REM station in the borough of Ville-Marie in the downtown core of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Metro station is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal STM and serves the Green Line. The REM station is operated by Pulsar, and is served by all REM branches. The Metro station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. Since November 2025, the station is also served by the Réseau express métropolitain REM. It is currently the second busiest station in the Metro network, as measured by number of passengers entering the system after BerriUQAM station. Prior to 2002, it was the busiest station in the network.  Overview  Designed by Crevier, Lemieux, Mercier and Caron, it is a normal side platform station built in open cut under boul. De Maisonneuve, with two ticket halls joined by corridors that surround the platforms. The station is named after, and is located adjacent to McGill University. The ticket halls are linked to the platforms by four stairways per platform, including the shortest escalators in the network. The station has large pillars, which were originally painted orange, but painted in beer bottle green colour in the late 1990s. In January 2010 the STM repainted the station in its original colours being orange pillars and yellow walls. As an important part of the underground city, the station has had its mezzanine level substantially enlarged since its opening, by construction of new buildings around the station: the western end of the mezzanine was added with the construction of the Tour BNP and Eaton Centre, while the southern corridor between the ticket halls was added to link the Promenades de la Cathédrale now known as Promenades Cathédrale with the station. No fewer than six buildings are directly connected to the station via underground city. The station has a further six direct street-level entrances, all of which are integrated into the façades of other buildings. A seventh entrance in a separate building was added in 2023 to provide elevator access, making the station accessible. Among this busy stations amenities include several shops and services directly in the station, including a Tim Hortons, Second Cup, a Scotiabank, two Pizza Shops, a web terminal, and MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train. This was second station after BerriUQAM to have them installed. At one time an open-concept branch of the Montreal Public Library was located next to the exit onto rue Université.  Renovation and upgrade works  In March 2012, the station underwent renovation work that included the replacement of Travertine tiles covering surfaces of the whole station, spanning over 1,835 square metres 19,750 sq ft. Other work included replacing the lighting system, fixing columns, beams, and concrete slabs and replacing granite staircases and handrails. By the end of 2016, modernized signage has been put in place, flooring has been completely replaced and the stained glass installation underwent a restoration and was put back in place. In 2020, work began on making the station universally accessible, ahead of the arrival of the REM. The project involves the construction of a new entrance building, two elevators, new public artwork and refurbishment of three of the other entrances. This was estimated to cost around 58 million. On April 3, 2023, McGill became the 26th accessible metro station in the network, with the completion of the refurbishment work.  Réseau express métropolitain station  In November 2016, CDPQ Infra announced that the proposed Réseau express métropolitain REM system would connect to the Green line at McGill. As with the 1980s Line 3 proposal, the REM uses the historic Mont Royal tunnel to head north from downtown. The REM station is located under McGill College Avenue, and a pedestrian tunnel connects it to the Green Line station concourse, as well as the wider Underground City. CDPQ Infra indicates that the station will be the 2nd busiest station on the REM, with over 25,000 passengers per day. Construction on the McGill REM station began in September 2018. In this location, the Mont Royal tunnel is not bored through solid rock, and therefore work to strengthen the historic tunnel was required. The REM station opened on 17 November 2025.  Entrances  The station has seven entrances: 690, De Maisonneuve Ouest 640, De Maisonneuve Ouest 811, De Maisonneuve Ouest 2055, Robert-Bourassa Boulevard 2021, Avenue Union 1445, Av.

    "text": "Hirschholm Palace, also known as Hørsholm Palace, was a royal palace located in present-day Hørsholm municipality just north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It was rebuilt in the Baroque style in the 1740s and, one of the finest buildings of its time, it became known as the Versailles of the North. It developed a notorious reputation in connection with its role in the affair between Johann Friedrich Struensee and Queen Caroline Mathilda in the 1770s. After that it fell into disrepair and was demolished in 18091813. The palace was designed by Lauritz de Thurah for King Christian VI and his consort Queen Sophie Magdalene, and was intended as their summer residence.  History   Early history  Hirschholm Palace was built on a site that had been used since the Middle Ages. From around 1100 there was a fortification at site known as Hørningsholm. In 1391 the estate became crown land when Queen Margrete I took possession of the property. At the end of the 16th century, Frederik II and Christian IV built a royal hunting lodge on the site. The estate, which covered a large area the present-day municipalities of Hørsholm, Karlebo, Birkerød and a part of Allerød was called the Noble Estate of Hørsholm adelsgodset Hørsholm, and was endowed to various noblemen and members of the royal court. By the middle of the 17th century, a royal tradition had developed whereby the ruling king bestowed Hørsholm Palace to his consort, and it was used as a summer residence. The estate was now being managed directly by the royal house, and income went to the Queen. Frederick IVs consort Queen Louise owned Hørsholm Palace between 1700 and 1721. She had it modernised and added a number of farm buildings to the estate.  The Baroque palace  Immediately after he became king in 1730, King Christian VI donated Hirschholm to his queen consort, Sophie Magdalene, as a life estate. Thus began a new phase in the history of the site. The queen decided that the old castle should be converted into a decent summer residence for the king and queen. Until the takeover, conditions at the place had been modest, in fact it was a medieval facility where only a few modernizations had been made. The de Thurah-designed baroque palace was completed in 1744 and was one of the most impressive building works of that period. It was referred to as The Versailles of the North. When the king died in 1746 it became Sophie Magdalenes residence as Queen Dowager. She carried out a number of changes on the estate that pointed towards the agricultural reforms that would come to play a big role in the country during the coming decades. Thurahs drawings of the palace were published in Den Danske Vitruvius in 17461749. The Dowager Queen Sophie Magdalene died in 1770, and the palace was taken over by King Christian VII who used it as a summer residence for his family and court. On 17 June 1771 the royal family and court took summer residence at the palace, and on 7 July Queen Caroline Mathilde gave birth to her second child, Princess Louise Augusta, whose father was almost certainly Johann Friedrich Struensee. That summer has come to be referred to as the Hirschholm Summer in Danish history.  Neglect and demolition  After that summer, and after the arrest of Struensee and the Queen on 17 January 1772, and the subsequent execution of Struensee, and the banishment and imprisonment of the Queen, the palace stood empty until 1810. At that time Frederik VI had the now dilapidated palace torn down for use as build materials for the rebuilding of Christiansborg Palace, which had burned to the ground in the fire of 1794.  The site today  In 1822-23 a small church designed by architect Christian Frederik Hansen was built on the grounds of the demolished palace. The park surrounding the church, which is located on a small island in a lake, still bears some evidence of the original palace garden. A number of the farm buildings Queen Louise had built in the early 18th century still exist. Some of them formerly housed the Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry. The Hørsholm Local History Museum has a permanent exhibit about the palace, the royal affair and its consequences.

    "text": "Hockey Club Ak Bars Russian: Ак Барс, Tatar: Ак Барс, English: Snow Leopard, also known as Ak Bars Kazan, is a professional ice hockey club based in Kazan, Russia. It is a member of the Kharlamov Division in the Kontinental Hockey League KHL.  History  Founded as Mashstroy Kazan in 1956, the name was later changed to SC Uritskogo Kazan when it entered the Soviet Class B league in 1958. It was promoted to Soviet Class A2, where it gained promotion to the top tier of Soviet hockey. Kazans performance was respectable, starting the season by winning 6 out of 19 games against the best of the Soviet teams before falling away in the second half of the season and was demoted. Twice they won the USSR League lower tiers, being named Champion of Russia in 1962 and 1976. SC Uritskogo Kazans most successful period occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Uritskogo Kazan became Itil Kazan in 1990 and participated in the IHL. Itil was only mildly successful, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Vysshaya Liga in 1991 and 1992. It was following the establishment of the Russian Superleague RSL in 1996 that the golden age of hockey in Tatarstan began. Renamed Ak Bars Kazan after the traditional symbol of the Tatars, the snow leopard. Benefiting from the resources boom in the Urals, Ak Bars began its history in fine form, finishing first in their respective divisions in 1997 and 1998 along with winning the RSL in 1998. In the 200405 season, Kazan signed 11 National Hockey League players, including Russian superstars Alexei Kovalev and Ilya Kovalchuk and Canadians Vincent Lecavalier and Dany Heatley, in an attempt to celebrate Kazans 10th anniversary with a championship. They did not succeed, however, as a lack of continuity and chemistry saw them finish in fourth place and were upset in the first round of the playoffs by Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. Since then, Ak Bars Kazan dominated the RSL, winning the league in 2006. In 2007, Kazan paced the league with 35 wins and 214 goals in 54 games before falling at the final hurdle to Metallurg Magnitogorsk. Ak Bars has been led in recent years by the dominant ZZM line of Sergei Zinovjev, Danis Zaripov, and Aleksey Morozov, who have established themselves as one of the most dominant lines in recent history. Combined with veterans such as Vitaly Proshkin and Vladimir Vorobiev, and imports, such as Ray Giroux, Petr Čajánek, and Jukka Hentunen, Kazan has remained one of the top teams in the league. However, they have been at times criticized for lacking consistency and relying too heavily on star players such as Morozov. Ak Bars Kazan are strong rivals with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl and the neighboring team of Salavat Yulaev Ufa. However, Ak Bars was the strongest rival with Dynamo Moscow in the 1990s.

    "text": "The Mariposa botnet, discovered December 2008, is a botnet mainly involved in cyberscamming and denial-of-service attacks. Before the botnet itself was dismantled on 23 December 2009, it consisted of up to 12 million unique IP addresses or up to 1 million individual zombie computers infected with the Butterfly mariposa in Spanish Bot, making it one of the largest known botnets.  History   Origins and initial spread  The botnet was originally created by the DDP Team Spanish: Días de Pesadilla Team, English: Nightmare Days Team, using a malware program called Butterfly bot, which was also sold to various individuals and organisations. The goal of this malware program was to install itself on an uninfected PC, monitoring activity for passwords, bank credentials and credit cards. After that the malware would attempt to self-propagate to other connectible systems using various supported methods, such as MSN, P2P and USB. After completing its initial infection routine the malware would contact a command-and-control server within the botnet. This command and control server could be used by the controllers of the botnet, in order to issue orders to the botnet itself.  Operations and impact  The operations executed by the botnet were diverse, in part because parts of the botnet could be rented by third party individuals and organizations. Confirmed activities include denial-of-service attacks, e-mail spam, theft of personal information, and changing the search results a browser would display in order to show advertisements and pop-up ads. Due to the size and nature of a botnet its total financial and social impact is difficult to calculate, but initial estimates calculated that the removal of the malware alone could cost tens of millions of dollars. After the apprehension of the botnets operators government officials also discovered a list containing personal details on 800,000 individuals, which could be used or sold for Identity theft purposes. The countries most infected by the botnet were India, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea.  Dismantling  In May 2009 the Mariposa Working Group MWG was formed as an informal group, composed of Defence Intelligence, the Georgia Tech Information Security Center and Panda Security, along with additional unnamed security researchers and law enforcement agencies. The goal of this group was the analysis and extermination of the Mariposa botnet itself. On 23 December 2009 the Mariposa Working Group managed to take control of the Mariposa Botnet, after seizing control of the command-and-control servers used by the botnet. The operational owners of the botnet eventually succeeded in regaining control over the botnet, and in response launched a denial-of-service attack on Defence Intelligence. The attack itself managed to knock out Internet connectivity for a large share of the ISPs customers, which included several Canadian universities and government agencies. On 3 February 2010, the Spanish national police arrested Florencio Carro Ruiz alias: Netkairo as the suspected leader of the DDP Team. Two additional arrests were made on 24 February 2010. Jonathan Pazos Rivera alias: Jonyloleante and Juan José Ríos Bellido alias: Ostiator were arrested on the suspicion of being members of DDP. On 18 July 2010, Matjaž Škorjanc alias: Iserdo, the creator of the Butterfly bot malware, was arrested in Maribor by Slovenian police for the first time, but released due to lack of evidence. He was arrested again in October 2011. In December 2013 Škorjanc was convicted in Slovenia of creating a malicious computer program for hacking information systems, assisting in wrongdoings and money laundering. He was sentenced to 4 years and 10 months imprisonment and fined 3,000 3,000. The court also ordered the seizure of Škorjancs property acquired with the proceeds of crime. After he appealed the verdict his fine was in February 2015 raised for additional 25,000 EUR. On 5 June, 2019, US law enforcement opened a new case in the operations of the Mariposa Butterfly Bot, BFBOT malware gang. FBI has moved forward with new charges and arrest warrants against four suspects including NiceHashs operator Matjaž Škorjanc.  References   External links  Analysis of the Mariposa botnet",

It flies General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned aerial vehicles. In 1995 the 11th became the first Remotely Piloted Aircraft RPA squadron in the Air Force.  Overview  The 11th Attack Squadron was the U.S. Air Forces first MQ-1B Predator formal training unit that conducts 5 basic and advanced training courses: Initial Qualification, Instructor Upgrade Training, Foreign Officer Course, Senior Officer Course, and Launch  Recovery Course. The 11th conducts intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operating MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft.  History   World War II  The squadron was first activated as the 11th Observation Squadron at Wheeler-Sack Field in early 1942. It initially operated in the southeastern United States under Third Air Force flying antisubmarine patrols along the Gulf Coast after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The unit was reassigned to Fourth Air Force in Southern California during early 1942, flying reconnaissance, mapping, artillery adjustment, bombing, dive-bombing, and strafing missions to support Army ground units in training at the Desert Training Center or on maneuvers. It trained personnel in aerial reconnaissance, medium bombardment, and fighter techniques. With the closure of the Desert Training Center in late 1943, the unit returned to Third Air Force becoming a reconnaissance training unit for Army forces at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Fort Polk, Louisiana, Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After the war it was assigned to Shaw Field, South Carolina, and was never fully equipped or manned. The unit inactivated March 1946.  Cold War  The 11th was reactivated at Langley Field, Virginia in 1947. It was equipped with Lockheed RF-80 Shooting Stars as a photo-reconnaissance squadron. It was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force and moved to March Air Force Base, California. Budget constraints, though, resulted in the units inactivation in March 1949. It was reactivated during the Korean War and equipped with Douglas RB-26 Invaders and deployed to Kimpo AFB K-14, South Korea. Their RB-26C Invader aircraft were painted all black and flew a number of standardized intelligence-gathering missions. There were four standard missionsone that ran along the border with North Korea, another that flew up the North Korean coast on the east side, and another on the west side, and the final missions, called E in phonetic parlance of the day, Easy was a long duration mission that headed down the coast of China to the Shantung Peninsula, gathering signals and electronics data from what was then called Red China. In the mid-1950s, the units RB-26C Invader aircraft were transferred to the French, who used them both in France and later in Indo-China. The squadron operated as part of Far East Air Forces after the Korean War, engaging in photographic and weather reconnaissance missions over South Korea as well as the Japanese Home Islands and the adjacent waters along the Korean peninsula and ChineseSoviet Pacific coasts until 1960. In 1957 the 11th Squadron received twelve Douglas RB-66C Destroyer electronic intelligence gathering planes.  Vietnam war  It was activated as a McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance squadron in 1966 under Tactical Air Command. The squadron deployed to Thailand shortly after formation, flying tactical reconnaissance missions primarily over North Vietnam and selected locations in Laos and Cambodia. The squadron provided much of the aerial photographic intelligence obtained during the Vietnam War, especially that from North Vietnam. In the fall of 1970 the squadrons parent wing was phased down as part of the overall American withdrawal from the Vietnam War, returned to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina where the unit was inactivated in early 1971. The unit was reactivated at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base later in 1971 as a Ryan AQM-34 Firebee unmanned tactical reconnaissance drone squadron. Performed photographic reconnaissance to support tactical air and surface forces with tactical drones manufactured by Ryan Aeronautical. It used AQM-34LMV drones, Lockheed DC-130 Hercules launch vehicles, and Sikorsky CH-3 recovery helicopters.

    "text": "Rockit is a composition recorded by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and produced by Bill Laswell and Michael Beinhorn. Hancock released it as a single from his twenty-ninth album, Future Shock 1983. The selection was composed by Hancock, Laswell, and Beinhorn. The track was driven by its deejay scratch style, performed primarily by DXT, and its music video created by Godley  Creme, featuring the robotic art of Jim Whiting, which was put in high rotation on MTV. Rockit won a Grammy Award for Best RB Instrumental Performance in 1983, and it won five MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. In 2022 and 2025, Rolling Stone and Billboard magazine included the song in their lists of the best dance songs of all time.  Recording  Rockit was constructed and composed during the recording process, first at BC Studio in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with additional overdubs at RPM Studios in Manhattan, then Hancocks home studio in West Hollywood, and finally at Eldorado studio in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The production duo of Material bassist Bill Laswell and synth player Michael Beinhorn were based at Martin Bisis BC Studio, recording experimental, no wave and underground club music. Hancocks 25-year-old manager, Tony Meilandt, approached Laswell to write a new track for Hancock, whose career needed a boost. To gauge this potential new direction for his career, Hancock accompanied Laswell to hear a set of popular club DJs including Afrika Bambaataa and D.ST spin at Roxy NYC in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Warily eyeing the crowd, which to him looked like a riot, Hancock needed more convincing by Meilandt before he contracted with Laswells team to deliver two tracks. Meilandt later said Herbie was very much ready to try a new kind of sound. At BC Studios, Beinhorn used a new Oberheim DMX drum machine to lay down a basic beat, and Laswell brought in Daniel Ponce to augment this with Afro-Cuban batá drums. Ponce played the three drums one at a time during three recording passes, to make it sound like three drummers invoking a Santería spirit. Grand Mixer D.ST came to the studio with two deejay friends from his group Infinity Rappers to scratch for the track, bringing his own vinyl which included Change the Beat by Fab Five Freddy, which had been recorded in the same studio. D.ST found an interesting portion of the 12-inch vinyl near the end  the voice of manager Roger Trilling saying Ahhh! This stuff is really fresh through the studios vocoder  and he scratched through that section. Trilling had been playing with the vocoder in the studio, mocking Elektra Records executive Bruce Lundvall who was in the habit of sitting back in his chair and declaring a song fresh if he liked it, without knowing that the word fresh was current in hip-hop subculture. This moment was captured on tape, and Laswell worked it into the conclusion of Change the Beat. The 2-inch 16-track master tape containing rhythm parts and scratching needed to be transferred to 24-track 2-inch in order for Hancock to work with it at his home studio. Laswell and Bisi took the tape to RPM Studios in Greenwich Village, but instead of simply transferring the format, they added some extra sounds, especially a stab of guitar taken from a Led Zeppelin song on the album Coda. Using the repeat hold function of a Lexicon Prime Time digital delay, they attempted to capture a Led Zeppelin snare drum sound, but a moment of inattention resulted in the guitar stab, which Laswell found better suited his purpose. Hancock first heard the work-in-progress in West Hollywood at his home studio, a former guest house in back of his main residence. Hancock determined that the track needed a melody line. Hancock, Laswell and Beinhorn composed one on the spot by humming out loud to each other. Then Hancock recorded his ideas on three different synthesizers, performing on them one at a time. When Hancock suggested performing some vocoder vocal scat, Laswell and Beinhorn said they could instead sample lyrics from a hit song, specifically the line Rock it, dont stop it from Planet Rock, which was at that time a hit for Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force. This lyric sample produced the title Rockit. A final recording session was convened at Eldorado Studios located at Hollywood and Vine, Hollywood, Los Angeles. To round out the turntablist sounds, D.ST flew out from New York along with his colleague Grandmaster Caz. Session engineer Dave Jerden remarked to Beinhorn that Hancock appeared hopeful about the track, but that he did not realize what he had. After the brief 90-minute session, the New York contingent went to a local stereo shop to pass the time before their flight home. Carrying a cassette tape of the final mix, they listened to Rockit on some loudspeakers at the shop, attracting the attention of children from the neighborhood who were amazed and curious. Judging their reaction, Laswell told D.ST, Thats a hit record.  Personnel  He",

    "text": "Lenovo Skylight was a small portable computer with mobile data capabilities sometimes called a smartbook designed by Richard Sappper for Lenovo. The project was announced in January 2010, but was cancelled less than six months later.  Design  Skylight was designed by Richard Sapper. After having a conversation with David Hill, Vice President of Lenovo Brand Management on November 12th, 2008 Sapper agreed to create a design for the device despite the short turn around needed. Sapper had to deliver his completed design by December 18th, 2008. This turnaround time was so short, Sapper began working on the design before Lenovo officially approved him as the designer. He was successful in delivering two complete models. The USB stick that was included on Skylight was originally designed as a removable telephone headset to be used with the wireless connectivity built into the device.  History  A Lenovo device was submitted to the FCC in October 2008, rumored to be the smartbook in question. Qualcomm was rumored to announce a smartbook at an analyst meeting on November 12, 2009. A Lenovo device concept was shown, and reported that it would be announced officially at the Consumer Electronics Show of January 2010. In early January 2010, it was announced that the Lenovo smartbooks name would be Skylight and more detailed specifications were made public. Skylight was expected to be sold through ATT carrier in the US for 499USD with no contract. Users would have purchased data plans to use the 3G connectivity while away from Wi-Fi. The planned release date was April 2010. Some of the design differences from a traditional notebook included a semicircular shape, relatively larger touchpad, and Universal Serial Bus connector which extends out from the keyboard surface. Skylight used the Snapdragon technology from Qualcomm with a custom Linux operating system. The primary function was to search the internet, message and consume content through the custom, widget-style interface called web gadgets. On May, 28 2010, the product was cancelled by Lenovo. They stated in a press release that it was focusing on Android-based mobile devices.  References   External links  Official website",

Released in the summer of 1970, the album is more blues-based hard rock than its predecessor, yet still contains the characteristic fuzz guitar sound featured prominently on the groups first album, Frijid Pink. This is the last album to feature Kelly Green Tom Beaudry and Gary Ray Thompson; their departure from the group soon followed, fueled by an ego-driven notion that they were Frijid Pink. The band were on the brink of major success at that time, but this breach of contract essentially ruined their chances. The LP reached only 149 on U.S. charts, although the debut one reached 11; the track Sing A Song For Freedom as a single made 55 in the US in July 1970 and 22 in Canada that September where the LP reached 54.

    "text": "Domain-general learning theories of development suggest that humans are born with mechanisms in the brain that exist to support and guide learning on a broad level, regardless of the type of information being learned. Domain-general learning theories also recognize that although learning different types of new information may be processed in the same way and in the same areas of the brain, different domains also function interdependently. Because these generalized domains work together, skills developed from one learned activity may translate into benefits with skills not yet learned. Another facet of domain-general learning theories is that knowledge within domains is cumulative, and builds under these domains over time to contribute to our greater knowledge structure. Psychologists whose theories align with domain-general framework include developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, who theorized that people develop a global knowledge structure which contains cohesive, whole knowledge internalized from experience, and psychologist Charles Spearman, whose work led to a theory on the existence of a single factor accounting for all general cognitive ability. Domain-general learning theories are in direct opposition to domain-specific learning theories, also sometimes called theories of Modularity. Domain-specific learning theories posit that humans learn different types of information differently, and have distinctions within the brain for many of these domains. Domain-specific learning theorists also assert that these neural domains are independent, purposed solely for the acquisition of one skill i.e. facial recognition or mathematics, and may not provide direct benefits in the learning of other, unrelated skills.  Related Theories   Piagets Theory of Cognitive Development  Developmental psychologist, Jean Piaget, theorized that ones cognitive ability, or intelligence  defined as the ability to adapt to all aspects of reality  evolves through a series of four qualitatively distinct stages the sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational and formal operational stages. Piagets theory describes three core cognitive processes that serve as mechanisms for transitioning from one stage to the next. Piagets core processes for developmental change: Assimilation: The process of transforming new information so that it fits with ones existing way of thinking. Accommodation: The process of adapting ones thinking to account for new experiences. Equilibration: The process by which one integrates their knowledge about the world into one unified whole. However, these processes are not the only processes responsible for progressing through Piagets developmental stages. Each stage is differentiated based upon the types of conceptual content that can be mastered within it. Piagets theory holds that transitioning from one stage of development to the next is not only a result of assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration, but also a result of developmental changes in domain-general mechanisms. As humans mature, various domain-general mechanisms become more sophisticated, and thus, according to Piaget, allow for growth in cognitive functioning. For example, Piagets theory notes that the humans transition into the concrete operation stage of cognitive development when they acquire the ability to take perspective, and no longer have egocentric thinking a characteristic of the pre-operational stage. This change can be viewed as the result of developmental changes in information processing capacity. Information processing is a mechanism that is used across many different domains of cognitive functioning, and thus can be seen as a domain-general mechanism.  Psychometric Theories of Intelligence  Psychometric analysis of measurements of human cognitive abilities intelligence may suggest that there is a single underlying mechanism that impacts how humans learn. In the early 20th century, Charles Spearman noticed that childrens scores on different measures of cognitive abilities were positively correlated. Spearman believed that these correlations could be attributed to a general mental ability or process that is utilized across all cognitive tasks. Spearman labeled this general mental ability as the g factor, and believed g could represent an individuals overall cognitive functioning. The presence of this g factor across different cognitive measures is well-established and uncontroversial in statistical research. It may be that this g factor highlights domain-general learning cognitive mechanisms involved in all cognition, and that this general learning accounts for the positive correlations across seemingly different cognitive tasks. It is important to note, however, there currently is no consensus to what causes the positive correlations. Spearmans work was expanded upon by Raymond B. Cattell, who broke g into two broad abilities: fluid intelligence Gf and crystallized intelli",

    "text": "Ewerdt Hilgemann Born in Witten, February 21, 1938 is a German artist, currently living and working in the Netherlands.  Studies and career  Ewerdt Hilgemann was born in Witten, Germany and after a brief study at Westfälische Wilhelms-University in Münster, he attended Werkkunstschule and University of Saarland in Saarbrücken. In the 1960s he had residencies at Kätelhöhn Printers in Wamel, Asterstein in Koblenz and Halfmannshof in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Hilgemann started to exhibit his work across Europe in the early 1960s before moving to Gorinchem, the Netherlands in 1970. From 1977 to 1998 he taught Concept Development at the Sculpture Department of Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. Since 1984 Hilgemann lives and works in Amsterdam. His main workshop, however, remained in Hardinxveld-Giessendam, near Gorinchem.  Work  Hilgemanns bodies of work from the 1960s focused on wall pieces, consisting of wooden dowels, as well as serial and minimalistic installations Space Structures out of large resin or steel tubes. In the 1970s, reliefs and mostly wooden abstract geometrical sculptures followed, based on grids as well as the cube. The 1980s meant a change in thinking, when Hilgemann made his first photographic work Random Sculptures for herman de vries, followed by a series of granite boulders e.g. referencing to the maximum cube that can fit inside a sphere by cutting away what was needed to reveal the cube, yet showing all parts of the process. In 1982, for the first time with an audience, he rolled a perfectly polished marble cube 150x150x150 cm down hill in the famous Carrara quarry, where Michelangelo already got his marble from. The result was a scratched and battered piece, but it still remained recognisable as a cube! Rolling Cube 1982 shortened video. Likewise, in 1983 he brought two perfectly polished spheres to a controlled explosion, resulting in fractured pieces carefully accounted for 3 parts for the white Carrara marble, 9 parts for the dark Bardiglio marble. The same year, during sculpture symposium East-West Forum in Dordrecht, Netherlands he made his first welded steel cube, which he threw down from the rooftop of an abandoned factory. These sculptures and their planned destruction depend to a large extent on random circumstances. However, these can also be premeditated by stipulating their conditions. According to the artist, this equally is the case with his so-called Implosion Sculptures, which Hilgemann started in 1984 and that are still going on. The perfectly welded stainless steel geometrical shapes are vacuumed by a pump or by means of water, causing the body to slowly give way to the outside pressure, resulting in a new form, yet leaving a visual reference to the original. The most used shapes are cubes, square columns and pyramids. In 2014 Hilgemann was invited by the Park Avenue Sculpture Committee to exhibit his work on the median along Park Avenue in New York City for a period of three months, starting in August. For this prestigious environment Hilgemann designed new works for seven locations between 52nd and 67th Street, all made of stainless steel in different configurations, single pieces as well as groups of two or more.

He has been called a clean comedian, and has been noted for his deadpan, monotone delivery. Bargatze was the highest-grossing stand-up comic in 2024, with over a million tickets sold across his shows.  Early life  Bargatze was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Carol and Stephen Bargatze, on March 25, 1979. Stephen was a clown, member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and motivational speaker, while Carol worked in the ticket office for the Vanderbilt Commodores. After a troubled childhood, Stephen had initially studied to become a preacher, but ultimately graduated from Trevecca Nazarene College with a bachelors degree in education, 10 years after leaving high school. Raised in a devoutly religious Christian household, Bargatze is one of three children. His father practiced magic tricks with him while growing up, and Bargatze stated he performed in skits with his church group, beginning when he was around 11. He attended DuPont Elementary in Old Hickory, Tennessee until fourth grade, when he transferred to Donelson Christian Academy DCA in Nashville, where his father had a day job as a history teacher. He competed in track and field at DCA and tried out for the basketball and golf teams, but was cut from both. He graduated in 1997. Bargatze then attended Volunteer State Community College in nearby Gallatin for a year. During this time, he had various jobs, such as working in construction, manning a cellphone kiosk at Walmart, and delivering furniture. He enrolled in Western Kentucky University, but flunked each of his courses and dropped out. He also had a stint working at Applebees and later landed a job as a meter-reader for a water company in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. He was a fan of The Bob  Tom Show, a radio program which often hosted comedians, and it inspired him to become a comedian himself. One of his fellow meter-readers, Michael Clay, also had an ambition to become a comedian, and together they decided to quit their jobs and both pursue a comedy career. Bargatzes parents were supportive of his decision and attended his first open mic event.  Career   Early years  Bargatze began his comedy career in 2002, and moved to Chicago to attend The Second City, an improvisational comedy troupe. He soon decided against improv and instead enrolled in Jim Rauths Comedy College, which focused on stand-up comedy. At this time, Bargatze rented a basement apartment with his former co-worker Michael Clay and worked as a waiter at a nearby bar. He performed fill-in spots at Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago, and also performed at Zanies Nashville. In 2004, Bargatze moved to New York City, where he became a barker for the renowned Boston Comedy Club, handing out flyers in Greenwich Village in exchange for stage time at night in the club. Bargatze also worked as a dogwalker and a FedEx delivery driver during the day to support his comedy career. He has called the Jerry Seinfeld documentary Comedian 2002 life-changing and a big reason why he moved to New York. While at the Boston Comedy Club, he saw comedians such as Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Patrice ONeal, and Bill Burr perform live. Bargatze stated that it took about a year before he received a paying gig in New York. He spent most of his early years performing for single-digit crowds. Bargatze had a turning-point year in 2008, featuring on Comedy Centrals stand-up show Live at Gotham, Late Night with Conan OBrien, and the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. He toured extensively with the USO, performing for American troops stationed in countries such as the Bahamas, Greenland, Honduras, Iraq, and Kuwait. He co-hosted a podcast, It Could Be Better, with Chris Laker and Yannis Pappas from 2009 to 2013. He won both New Yorks Comedy Festival and the Boston Comedy Festival in 2010, and released his first 30-minute special in 2011, as part of an episode of Comedy Central Presents. Bargatze decided to move to Los Angeles in 2012, taking inspiration from Jerry Weintraubs quote as soon as you feel comfortable thats when its time to start over. He released his first comedy album, Yelled At By A Clown, in 2012 on Aspecialthing Records. It was on the Billboard Top Ten Comedy Charts for two weeks, peaking at No. 2. Bargatze received effusive praise from Marc Maron, and appeared on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast in 2012. He was booked on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in 2013. He also was part of Jimmy Fallons Clean Cut Comedy Tour that year. Speaking of his participation in the tour and his choice to be a clean comedian, Bargatze said: I grew up watching clean comedy. Starting out, I wanted my parents to come watch me. I still think that way, even though Im a parent now. Im a clean comic, but I dont really want people to notice it. ... A good compliment for me would be, I didnt even notice that you were clean.",

History and profile  Suomen Kuvalehti was founded in 1873 and published until the year 1880. The magazine started publishing again in 1917, and continues to this day. It was merged with Kansan Kuvalehti in 1934. The editor in 1935 was L.M. Viherjuuri. Ilmari Turja edited the magazine from 1936 to 1951. The headquarters of Suomen Kuvalehti is in Helsinki. Otava publisher publishes the magazine, every Friday. One of its former editor is Ville Pernaa. Suomen Kuvalehti originally supported center-right politics in the country. In the aftermath of the Finnish Civil War, from which Finland emerged as an independent, democratic republic, the magazine valorized the victorious Whites as patriots and heroes. It also published Vapautemme hinta, a book detailing Finnish losses during the Winter War and like the vast majority of the Finnish press strongly favored the Finnish government against the Soviet invasion of Finland. During the Cold War period it was one of the Finnish publications which were accused by the Soviet Union of being the instrument of US propaganda, and the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki frequently protested the editors of the magazine. In more modern times, the magazine has had a conservative and Finnish liberal stance without direct political affiliation. The weekly aims to write in-depth articles about current topics and to provide opinion-shaping editorials. The magazine focuses on news about national and international politics and culture. It is one of the investigative journalism outlets in the country. Diary excerpts of Finnish novelist Antti Tuuri about his visit to Germany between 1992 and 1995 were published in Suomen Kuvalehti. The comic strip Blondie regularly appears in the magazine. In the Jyviä ja akanoita wheat and chaff column, various humorous misprints and grammatical goofs from other magazines and newspapers are printed. In March 1997 two journalists from Suomen Kuvalehti were arrested in Diyarbakır, Turkey, while reporting about the Kurdish movement in the region.  Circulation  The circulation of Suomen Kuvalehti was 102,000 copies in 2007 and 96,000 copies in 2009. In 2010 its circulation fell to 88,667 copies. The 2011 circulation of the weekly grew to 91,277 copies. But, it fell to 86,786 copies in 2012 and to 79,275 copies in 2013.  Editor  Matti Kivekäs 191618 L. M.

    "text": "Soprano Home Movies is the 78th episode of the HBO television drama series The Sopranos and the 13th episode of the sixth season. It served as the midseason premiere to the second part of Season 6, which HBO broadcast in two parts. The episode was written by supervising producers Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider, series creatorexecutive producer David Chase, and executive producer Matthew Weiner, and it was directed by frequent series director Tim Van Patten. The episode first aired in the United States on April 8, 2007. It led the weekly Nielsen cable television ratings for the week ending April 8, and critical reception was largely positive.  Starring  James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Jennifer Melfi  Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano Michael Imperioli as Christopher Moltisanti Dominic Chianese as Corrado Soprano Jr.  Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante Tony Sirico as Paulie Gualtieri Robert Iler as Anthony Soprano Jr. Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Meadow Soprano Aida Turturro as Janice Soprano Baccalieri Steven R. Schirripa as Bobby Baccalieri Vincent Curatola as Johnny Sack Sacrimoni Frank Vincent as Phil Leotardo Dan Grimaldi as Patsy Parisi Gregory Antonacci as Butch DeConcini   credit only   credited for archive footage  Guest starring   Synopsis  In Brooklyn, a party is held for Phil Leotardo, who has recently returned after a long convalescence following his heart attack. Phil tells the Lupertazzi crime family that he is ready to settle down and enjoy his grandchildren. A flashback of two years prior shows Tony Soprano fleeing into the woods when Johnny Sack is arrested by the FBI. A teenage boy sees Tony throw a pistol into the snow and retrieves it. In the present, the boy is arrested on a drug charge and the gun is found in his possession, armed with hollow-point bullets. Essex County police ostentatiously arrest Tony on a gun charge based on the boys testimony. He is briefly jailed but his attorney, Neil Mink, easily secures his release on bail. The gun charge is soon dropped, and no longer hangs over Tonys approaching birthday weekend. The FBI later includes this charge in a RICO case being built against Tony. Tony and Carmela travel to Janice and Bobbys cabin in upstate New York to celebrate Tonys birthday. Tony and Bobby bond as they fire a customized AR-10 assault rifle, Bobbys birthday present to Tony, in the nearby woods. Tony tasks Bobby with a new set of responsibilities in the Soprano family, and hints at a still higher position in the near future. Bobby muses how suddenly and silently death can happen in their lives as gangsters: You probably dont even hear it when it happens, right? Tony comments that Bobby has never popped his cherry killed anyone in contrast with Bobbys father, who according to Tony, was a notorious hit man in his time. Bobby replies that he has come close, but that his father never wanted it for him. Carmela phones A.J.; he answers the phone, not at the pizzeria where he is now working, but in his parents bed with Blanca. A group of friends also come for a party. After dinner, Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice play Monopoly, arguing about house rules, drinking, and joking. Tony is angry with Janice when she tells a story that discredits their father. He makes a crude joke about her in return, insincerely apologizes, but then makes another, provoking Bobby to punch him in the face. There is a messy and ferocious fight. Tony ends up on the floor, bloodied, unable to rise. Panicking, Bobby tries to drive off drunk and backs into a tree; he returns and apologizes. Janice is enraged with Bobby, fearing retaliation from Tony. In the morning, Tony and Carmela are persuaded to stay, but Tony fixates on his loss in the fight. In the afternoon, the women apprehensively watch Tony and Bobby leave, ostensibly for a game of golf. In reality, the two men are meeting with a pair of Québécois. In exchange for a large amount of expired prescription medication at a heavy discount, Tony agrees to a hit on the brother-in-law of one of the Québécois and asks Bobby to personally take care of it. Bobby has to accept. They return to the cabin and Carmela and Tony leave for home. Bobby immediately sets off for Montreal for the hit; he kills the man at point-blank range, drops the gun and walks off. He returns to the cabin, picks up his daughter, and hugs her. Back home, Tony watches a Soprano Home Movies DVD given to him by Janice as a birthday present: it shows himself and Janice as children, playing together.

    "text": "Dickin is a surname of English and Irish origin originating in the mid-11th century during the Norman conquests.  History  The origin of the Dickin surname stems from the Norman conquests of 1066 and King Richard the First of England. Patronymic naming, established following the Norman conquests, meant that Richards son would become Richardson Richard  Son. Eventually, as the shorthand for Richard became Dick the name morphed into Dickson and several other related names. In order to be gender neutral, the name also morphed into being the kin of Richard, as in Richards kin or Dick  Kin, which was eventually shortened to Dickin.  Geographic settlement   Great Britain  The 1891 England and Wales census shows a high concentration of Dickin families in Lancashire 19, Shropshire 23, and Staffordshire 15. A large number of records between 1532 and 1812 show the prominent use of the Dickin surname at that time.  North America  The earliest known records of the Dickin family in North America show John Dickin landing in New England in 1753 and Alexander Dickin landing in Maryland in 1813.  Alternate spellings  While the root of the surname is always Richard, the Dickin surname has seen its spelling changed. This is mainly due to the societal illiteracy of the time; writing had not become widespread throughout society and many names were spoken, but rarely written. Dicun Dycon Diccon Dykyns Dikins Dicin Dikun Dicon Dicconson  Related surnames  With Richard as its root patronymic, Dickin is related to several other surnames: Richard Richardson Dickson Dickens Dickenson Dixon Dickins  Notable people with the surname  Albert Dickin 19011955, British swimmer John Dickin 18991966, British swimmer Maria Dickin 18701951, British social reformer Mike Dickin 19432006, English radio DJ  See also  Dickin Medal, award for animals, known as the animals Victoria Cross  References",

    "text": "The Sonobe module is one of the many units used to build modular origami. The popularity of Sonobe modular origami models derives from the simplicity of folding the modules, the sturdy and easy assembly, and the flexibility of the system.  History  The origin of the Sonobe module is unknown. Two possible creators are Toshie Takahama Japanese: 高浜利恵 and Mitsunobu Sonobe Japanese: 薗部光伸, who published several books together and were both members of Sōsaku Origami Gurūpu 67 Japanese: 創作折り紙グループ67. The earliest appearance of a Sonobe module was in a cube attributed to Mitsunobu Sonobe in the Sōsaku Origami Gurūpu 67s magazine Origami in Issue 2 1968. It does not reveal whether he invented the module or used an earlier design; the phrase finished model by Mitsunobu Sonobe is ambiguous. The diagram from Issue 2 reappears in 1970 in the groups book New Introduction to Origami Japanese: 新しい折り紙入門, Hepburn: Atarashii origami nyūmon. Another 1970s appearance of the unit was in the model Toshies Jewel, from Toshie Takahamas book Creative Life With Creative Origami Vol 1 Japanese: 暮しをかざるおりがみ. In the mid-1970s, Steve Krimball created the 30-unit ball, as mentioned in The Origamian vol. 13, no. 3 June 1976. Since then, many variations of modified Sonobe units have been developed; some examples of these can be found in Meenakshi Mukerjis book Marvelous Modular Origami 2007. Another variation to Sonobe models is the addition of secondary units to basic Sonobe unit forms to create new geometric shapes; some of which can be seen in Tomoko Fuses book Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations 1990.  Description  Each individual unit is folded from a square sheet of paper, of which only one face is visible in the finished module; many ornamented variants of the plain Sonobe unit that expose both sides of the paper have been designed. The Sonobe unit has the shape of a parallelogram with 45º and 135º angles, divided by creases into two diagonal tabs at the ends and two corresponding pockets within the inscribed center square. The system can build a wide range of three-dimensional geometric forms by docking these tabs into the pockets of adjacent units. Three interconnected Sonobe units will form an open-bottomed triangular pyramid with an equilateral triangle for the open bottom, and isosceles right triangles as the other three faces. It will have a right-angle apex equivalent to the corner of a cube and three tabpocket flaps protruding from the base. This particularly suits polyhedra that have equilateral triangular faces: Sonobe modules can replace each notional edge of the original deltahedron by the central diagonal fold of one unit and each equilateral triangle with a right-angle pyramid consisting of one half each of three units, without dangling flaps. The pyramids can be made to point inwards; assembly is more difficult but some cases of encroaching can be obviously prevented. The simplest shape made of these pyramids, often called Toshies Jewel shown above, is named after origami artist Toshie Takahama, who first printed a diagram of this in her 1974 book Creative Life with Creative Origami. It is a three-unit hexahedron built around the notional scaffold of a flat equilateral triangle two faces, three edges; the protruding tabpocket flaps are simply reconnected on the underside, resulting in two triangular pyramids joined at the base, a triangular bipyramid. A popular intermediate model is the triakis icosahedron, shown below. It requires 30 units to build.  Usage  The table below shows the correlation between three basic characteristics  faces, edges, and vertices  of polygons composed of Toshies Jewel sub-units of varying size and the number of Sonobe units used: The model made of three units results in a triangular bipyramid. Building a pyramid on each face of a regular tetrahedron, using six units, results in a cube the central fold of each module lays flat, creating square faces instead of isosceles right triangular faces, and changing the formula for the number of faces, edges, and vertices, or triakis tetrahedron. Building a pyramid on each face of a regular octahedron, using twelve Sonobe units, results in a triakis octahedron. Building a pyramid on each face of a regular icosahedron requires 30 units, and results in a triakis icosahedron. Uniform polyhedra can be adapted to Sonobe modules by replacing non-triangular faces with pyramids having equilateral faces; for example by adding pentagonal pyramids pointing inwards to the faces of a dodecahedron a 90-module ball can be obtained. The 270-module ball looks like a very complicated shape, but it is just an icosahedron with each triangular face divided into 9 small triangles. Each small triangle is made of 3 sonobe units. Arbitrary shapes, beyond symmetrical polyhedra, can also be constructed; a deltahedron with 2N faces and 3N edges requires 3N Sonobe modules. A popular class of arbitrar",

    "text": "Michelle Jaffé is an American intermedia artist, known for her immersive participatory installations combining sculpture, sound, and performative video. Symbols, forms, and concepts in her work are often influenced by political, spiritual, and psychological themes. Prior to her career as an artist, Jaffé was notable in the New York City fashion scene for her hat and accessory designs.  Early life and education  Jaffé lived and was educated in Europe from ages fourteen to twenty-three. Her paternal grandparents lived in Shanghai and childhood exposure to both traditional Chinese and Japanese art had a significant influence on her visual sensibility and artistic development. In 1979, Jaffé earned a BA Honors in Fine Arts and French literature at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England. She studied stone carving at the Sculpture Center School in 1991, sculpture at the New York Studio School in 1992, and sound at Harvestworks Digital Media in 2002, and Jewelry Design at Fashion Institute of Technology in New York in 1995.  Artwork  Jaffés mature body of work combines sculpture, sound and vocal compositions, and video within installations that prompt active listening. Her formative sculptures made from steel, aluminum, and other malleable materials, resemble shapes and forms that evoke armor, such as breastplates, chastity belts, and medieval codpieces. Her Vestment Series 2000-2007 of metal sculptures envision clothing as a form of both physical and psychological shelter. Regarding two particular sculptures from the series, Breastplate 2002 and Preying Mantis 2002, Olivia Kohler-Maga, Assistant Director of the Luther W. Brady Art Gallery at George Washington University, observed that, In Breastplate, she takes a piece of armorsomething that is meant to protect youand it becomes almost delicate and airy, floating off the wall. In case you think the work isnt fit for battle, the back edges are fitted with menacing, serrated edges. The piece next to it, Preying Mantis, takes the forms a step further, likening it to an insect known for its attack. Around the year 2000, Jaffé started exploring sound alongside her sculptural works. Some of her notable audiovisual works include Wappen Field, exhibited at Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2011; Bosi Contemporary gallery in New York in 2012; Beall Center for Art Technology at UC Irvine in 2013; Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 2015; New Media Gallery in New Westminster, Canada in 2017, and Soul Junk, exhibited at Milton Art Bank in Milton, Pennsylvania in 2017; White Box in New York City in 2019; MurmurMutterYell exhibited at 11 Rivington, New York in 2021; and GRIFTERs Gambit exhibited at NYU Audio Lab at 370 Media Commons, Brooklyn in 2025. Wappen Field 2003 - 2015 is a twenty-seven minute abstract vocal composition utilizing SuperCollider programming. The recording is played through twelve chrome plated steel helmets to create an enveloping sonic installation that moves throughout each helmet. Jaffé has stated that the installation is intended to prompt participants to contemplate what we, as human beings, share in common instead of focusing on what divides us. Art historian Stephanie Buhmann notes that while everyone who experiences Wappen Field is enveloped by a separate mask and a unique component of the vocal composition, it also guarantees a sharable endeavor because viewers must interact with each helmet to hear the complete composition. When Wappen Field was exhibited in 2011 as part of a group exhibition at the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts in Grand Rapids, Michigan, art critic Joseph Becherer noted that it was Among the most sophisticated in terms of concept and form. Wappen Field was also featured in the exhibition Behind the Mask at Culture Lab LIC, in Queens, New York in 2024. Soul Junk 2013 - 2019 is a twenty-eight minute, three-channel video and sound installation, presenting a female stream of conscious narrative juxtaposing personal trauma with observations about abuses of power throughout society. Murmur  Mutter  Yell  2019-2021 is a sound and light installation using Wave Field Synthesis speakers to sculpt the thirty-five-minute vocal composition in a three-dimensional space. The libretto explores the implications of private data that is mined from an online user agreeing to a website or applications conditions and terms. LocaleS3 2023 is a collaborative project using sound as a kinetic plastic material for making sculpture. In 2022, Jaffé, along with Phil Edelstein and David Reeder began working series of projects that share interests in composing, the physical and dimensional properties of sound, and software. The first, titled LocaleS3 premiered during Harvestworks 2023 Art and Technology Program on Governors Island. It consists of a series of immersive compositions arranged in site-specific locations within a house that are disc",

    "text": "Epsilon Scorpii is a binary star in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. The primary component has the proper name Larawag . It has an apparent visual magnitude of around 2.3, making it the fifth-brightest member of the constellation. Parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission provide a measured distance of 63.7 light-years 19.5 parsecs.  Characteristics  Larawag has a stellar classification of K1 III, which indicates it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved into a giant star. Its mass is estimated at 1.3 times the mass of the Sun, and its radius is 12.65 times that of the Sun. Presently it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of helium at its core, which, considering the stars composition, places it along an evolutionary branch termed the horizontal branch. In the color-magnitude diagram, the star is located in the red clump. The stars outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 4,522 K, giving it the orange hue of a cool K-type star. It is classified as a suspected variable star with a magnitude range of 2.23 to 2.35, although a study of Hipparcos photometry showed a variation of no more than 0.010.02 magnitudes. It is an X-ray source with a luminosity of 1.51.61027 ergs. In 2018 it was found that Epsilon Scorpii A has a proper motion companion separated by 14.4, making it a binary star sytstem. The companion, B, is much smaller and fainter than the primary, with 0.26 of the mass, 0.29 the radius, and less than 1 of the Suns luminosity.  Nomenclature  ε Scorpii, Latinised to Epsilon Scorpii, is the stars Bayer designation. The star bore the traditional name Larawag in the culture of the Wardaman people of the Northern territory of Australia, meaning clear sighting. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names WGSN to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Larawag for Epsilon Scorpii A on 19 November 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. Patrick Moore introduced the name Wei as Chinese name for this star. However, this seems to be a misreading, as Chinese 尾宿 Wěi Xiù, English Tail refers to an asterism i.e. Chinese constellation consisting of Epsilon Scorpii, Mu1 Scorpii, Zeta Scorpii, Eta Scorpii, Theta Scorpii, Iota Scorpii, Kappa Scorpii, Lambda Scorpii and Upsilon Scorpii. Consequently, the name for Epsilon Scorpii itself is 尾宿二 Wěi Xiù èr, which means the Second Star of Tail.  In culture  Epsilon Scorpii appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolising the state of Ceará.

    "text": "Not Pretty Enough is a song by Australian country singer-songwriter Kasey Chambers, produced by her brother Nash Chambers for her second studio album, Barricades  Brickwalls 2001. It was released as the albums third single on 14 January 2002 in Australia as a CD single. It became a number-one hit in Australia the same year, and it also found success in New Zealand, where it reached number four. In the United States, it was serviced to adult album alternative radio in late January 2002. The song was written by Chambers as a commentary on the reluctance of commercial radio stations towards playing her music, despite her being an established performer. However, the single prompted Chambers commercial breakthrough and was most-added song to radio station playlists in 2002.  Reception  In 2017, the song was selected for the National Film and Sound Archives Sounds of Australia collection of historically and culturally important recordings. Junkee said, 2009s The Loved Ones, a horror film about an obsessed stalker, put Kasey Chambers hit in the mouth of its villain. But it wasnt subverting the song; it was just making the subtext into text. Not Pretty Enough is a ballad about over-stepping boundaries and weaponising self-hatred. The creepiness is already there. Its a gloriously uncomfortable tilt into the painful things about love.  Track listing   Charts   Certifications   Release history   References",

    "text": "Romorantin - Pruniers Air Detachment DA 273 is a French Air Force military facility, located 6 kilometres 3.7 mi southwest of Romorantin-Lanthenay, in the Loir-et-Cher department of central France. Pruniers airfield was part of a huge depot built for the United States Army Air Service during World War I as an aircraft engineering facility. After the Armistice, the airfield stayed operational, with a French Air Force depot built in 1934. The airfield is slightly widened during World War II by the German Luftwaffe, but not much used. It returned to French control in September 1944, still as a depot.  Overview  DA 273 is primarily a logistics base for repairing aircraft by maintaining warehouses of spare parts. It is also a center for printing and issuing the technical documentation for the French Air Force. It also operates a small grass airfield as center for glider pilot training. It has a worldwide reputation as the gliding training site for the air Air Force for national and international competitions. The base employs approximately 650; half of the workforce are civilian personnel.  History  The first aviation use of Romorantin was in 1911, when a professor at the Collège Maurice Genevoix in Romorantin set up a Society pour le Développement de lAéronautique. On 3 June 1911, the new society organized the demonstration of a Blériot Aéronautique monoplane which was flown for eight and one-half minutes from the military training and firing range of La Butte. After the flight, the crowd went wild and the Mayor offered champagne. After a second flight, this aviation event remained deeply marked in local annals. According to the elected officials at the time, there were more than 10,000 people in attendance at the demonstration. On 31 March 1912, the city council received a letter from the Ligue National Aéronautique an aviation lobbying association whose president was Georges Clemenceau suggesting that some land be provided for an airfield. With the help of the LNA, a station aéronautique is set on the military range of La Butte, one miles out of Romorantin, on the road leading to the futur Pruniers airfield, with one hangar at the edge of the field; the new aerodrome was inaugurated in June 1913. No civil aircraft were permanently based as the station was mostly designed to bring shelter for passing aircraft: in 1913, during military manoeuvres, some French Aeronautique Militaires planes landed at the airfield, on a stop-over to Limoges.  World War I  From 1915, the La Butte airfield was often used by the trainer aircraft from the Avord air school; it was event projected for a time to build a flying school on the airfield. With the construction of the American depot at Pruniers, the old airfield was abandoned and used to store disused aircraft. In early 1917, after the entry of the United States into the war, the site of Pruniesr was chosen over eight others for use by the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Forces for the establishment of a large Air Force Depot, eventually known as the Air Service Production Center No. 2. Romorantin was selected due to the low population density, the flatness of the terrain, the large presence of timber and also the fact that a large number or railroads between the Atlantic shipping ports converged there and also went into the Zone of the Advance Western Front.  Facilities  On 28 June 1917, the first American forces arrived, the 75th, 109th and 116th Aero Squadrons Construction which initially established quarters for themselves in the French Army Camp des Bluets about three miles away from the facility. The first construction was that of a railroad line and barracks for themselves at the field. Within two weeks, the barracks were ready and construction of the actual base was begun. The 116th Squadron was transferred out and the 75th and 109th were re-designated as the 487th Aero Construction and 803d Aero Repair. Construction then began in earnest on the base facilities and also two landing field. Additional units brought in for construction were the 465th and 493d Aero Squadrons Construction. A compound for the American soldiers assigned to Romorantin was established at a French barracks named North Camp Gièvres in the nearby town of Pruniers-en-Sologne. The camp eventually became the home of almost 30,000 personnel, living in barracks. However, their influence in Pruniers, along with the towns of Gièvres, Villefranche-sur-Cher and Romorantin was evident. They made many friends with the local inhabitants and frequented the shops, restaurants and taverns daily. Also the Americans relied on the local economy for civilian workers such as bakers, cooks, and various tradesmen. Eventually the facility consisted of over 200 buildings on 40 hectares 99 acres of land; a gasoline and oil depot; refrigerator plant; weapons storage area, a workshop for locomotive repair; three aircraft landing fields along with",

The ship was the only ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the giraffe, a large ruminant mammal of Africa, having a very long neck that makes it the tallest of quadrupeds. Her keel was laid down as Sanford B. Dole by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, in Wilmington, California. She was launched on 11 November 1943 sponsored by Miss Mary F. Leddy and commissioned on 12 December 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Frederick F. Daly, USNR, commanding. Following shakedown, Giraffe put in at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, on 10 February 1944 and subsequently refueled warships at Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, Ulithi, and Palau before reaching Okinawa on 21 July 1945. She entered Sasebo, Japan, on 20 November at wars end and served the occupation fleet until departing Yokosuka on 21 February 1946 for Pearl Harbor and Norfolk, Virginia. Giraffe reached Norfolk 3 May and decommissioned there 17 June 1946. Returned to the War Department that date, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 July 1946.

    "text": "California Music was an American rock supergroup that formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1974. It was originally a loose collective of studio musicians, with participation from Bruce Johnston, Terry Melcher, Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher, Dean Torrence, and Brian Wilson. Equinox Records released three singles by the group from 1974 to 1976, after which the band went inactive. In 2021, the group was reformed by members of the Beach Boys and their children. Omnivore Recordings released their first album: California Music Presents Add Some Music.  History   Original iteration  The group was conceived by former Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher. Though still under contract to Warner Bros. Records, Brian Wilson signed a sideline production deal with Johnston and Melchers Equinox Records in early 1975. Together, they attempted to establish the loose-knit music collective with Gary Usher and Curt Boettcher. Biographer John Tobler described the project as involving Johnston, Melcher, Wilson, Dean Torrence, and a few others ... who had recorded previously as the Legendary Masked Surfers. Wilson was paid a bonus advance of 25,000, described by Johnston as probably the highest production royalty any producers ever received. Due to Wilsons irresponsible expenditures, his income had been redirected to the bank account of his wife Marilyn. According to biographer Timothy White, Wilson begged her to place the money in an account separate to hers. Wilson was involved with California Musics renditions of Why Do Fools Fall in Love and Jamaica Farewell, acting as co-producer, instrumentalist, and backing vocalist. Melcher spoke of his contributions: He wouldnt even touch anything in the control booth; he acted like he was afraid to. Hed offer suggestions, but he wouldnt go near the board. He knows his reputation, so he makes a lot of unfinished records; sometimes, I feel that he feels that hes peaked and does not want to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize. Melcher was reportedly crushed upon seeing Wilson in his poor mental and physical state, unable to recognize his former Wrecking Crew associates that Melcher had hired for the project. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Wilson refused to finish any more tracks for California Music. Wilson remembered meeting Elvis Presley at RCA Victor Studio on the day of recording Why Do Fools Fall in Love and inviting the singer to listen to what they had recorded. According to Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling, After a few tracks, Brian says, Well? Do you think theyre any good? Elvis looks up and replies, Nah, before leaving. I dont think he had any idea that the guy was Brian Wilson. Pursuant to his contract with Warner Bros., Wilson was liable to be sued by the label if he did not contribute a certain percentage to the Beach Boys studio recordings. Johnston recalled, Brian spent a day and night talking to us about it; he was really desperate for an outlet, because basically the deal at Warners was for the Beach Boys. At the behest of Marilyn, he was legally ousted from California Music in order to focus his undivided attention on the Beach Boys, who perceived the side project as Brians attempt to pay for his growing drug expenses. Mike Loves brother and Beach Boys manager Stephen Love said, He Brian said to me Dont try to reach me! Dont try to get to me! He was so upset Marilyn didnt want the Equinox deal to happen. The bonus advance was soon transferred to an account belonging to Marilyn at a different bank. In the meantime, the Beach Boys recent Endless Summer compilation was a great commercial hit, and the band  without Brian  was touring non-stop, making them the biggest live draw in the United States. According to Love: We were under contract with Warner Bros., and we couldnt have him going on a tangent. If he was going to be productive, its gotta be for the Beach Boys. With Wilson gone, California Music immediately disintegrated. Afterward, Boettcher soon collaborated with Johnston and the Beach Boys on the 1979 disco version of their song Here Comes the Night, which appeared on the album L.A. Light Album and marked Johnstons return to the Beach Boys.  Reformation  In 2021, a new iteration of California Music was organized and produced by David Beard, the editor and publisher of the Beach Boys fanzine Endless Summer Quarterly. The grouping consisted of Johnston and fellow Beach Boys Mike Love, Al Jardine, and David Marks, as well as children of the band members: Carnie and Wendy Wilson daughters of Brian; Justyn Wilson son of Carl; Christian, Hayleigh, and Ambha Love; and Matt Jardine. Their debut album, California Music Presents Add Some Music, was released via Omnivore Recordings on April 23, 2021. The re-recording of Add Some Music To Your Day was the first studio recording to feature Mike Love, Al Jardine, Johnston, and Mark",

    "text": "Transplacental carcinogenesis is a series of genotypic andor phenotypic changes in the cells of a fetus due to in utero exposure to carcinogens. Specifically, these changes are identified as malignant by virtue of their metastatic potential.  Transplacental transfer  The link between a pregnant mother and the fetus is such that at all sites of direct cell-to-cell contact, maternal tissues decidua and blood are juxtaposed to extraembryonic cells trophoblast. According to Cunningham, after conception, a biomolecular communication system is established between the fetus and mother that is operative from before the time of nidation and continues through and beyond the time of parturition. This communication system is essential to all facets of the pregnancy. Physiological processes such as fetal nutrition and fetal development progress directly from embryonicfetal tissue-directed modifications of maternal responses. Notably, the placenta is the principal site of transfer between mother and fetus. A fetus is exposed via the placenta to all substances which are present in the peripheral circulation of the mother. Overall, the abundance of toxins contained within cigarette smoke that is inhaled by the mother exerts a direct impact by altering the placental and fetal cell proliferation and differentiation. The vital balance of cellular activity is disrupted. The association of in utero exposure to such carcinogens and the subsequent development of cancer has been reported for all childhood cancers combined and particularly for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors.  Fetal cell sensitivity  Fetal cells are most sensitive to carcinogens during the early stages of gestation. Notably, early in the gestational period, there is a high rate of cell division. Additionally, the cells exhibit undifferentiated characteristics. These compounding factors illustrate the basis for this heightened cellular sensitivity to genotoxic agents. For example, it has been proven that during exposure nicotine binds to receptors of the fetal cells through which developmentally important signaling occurs in many developing organs and tissues. Because the binding of these receptors is unanticipated by the regulated activity of the fetal cells it can be inferred that this is a disruption in the cellular process which can lead to detrimental effects such as the deregulation of vital signaling, expression, or repair. As indicated above, should this exposure occur during the early stages of gestation, the fetus will be more susceptible to such damage. In addition to receptor binding, it has also been proven that fetal tissues are suspected as privileged targets of neoplastic changes in light of the vast amount of cell proliferation and differentiation taking place. Notably, tumors are arrived at via proliferating cells. In the event that proliferating cells become uncontrolled, by any measure, this mutated activity would certainly be characteristic of an increased risk in ones chances of developing cancer.

    "text": "Fort William Sheriff Court is a judicial building on the High Street in Fort William in Scotland. The building, which continues to be used as a courthouse, is a Category C listed building.  History  Although sheriff court hearings have taken place in Fort William since 1794, a prison, with a courtroom, was only established in the town in 1849. In the early 1870s, court officials decided to commission a dedicated courthouse for the area. The site they selected was on the southeast side of the High Street, just to the west of the prison. The new building was designed by James Matthews and William Lawrie in the Gothic Revival style, built in red sandstone and was completed in 1876. It was extended to the rear in the 1880s. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of three bays facing southwest down the High Street. The first bay on the left was fenestrated with a pair of arched windows with hood moulds on each floor, with a gable above. The second bay, which was projected forward, was fenestrated with a pair of arched windows with hood moulds on the ground floor, and with a set of the three arched windows with hood moulds on the first floor, with a gable containing a trefoil above. The right-hand bay was formed by a three-stage tower: there was an arched doorway with a hood mould in the first stage, an arched window with a hood mould in the second stage and a small blind window with a hood mould in the third stage, all surmounted by a frieze containing a quatrefoil and two trefoils, and pyramid-shaped roof with brattishing. Internally, the principal room was the courtroom, with a vaulted ceiling, on the first floor. An extensive programme of refurbishment works was completed in 1996, enabling the building to continue to serve as the venue for sheriff court hearings in the area. In December 2000, the building was the venue for a fatal accident inquiry into the deaths of four venture scouts in an avalanche on Aonach Mòr in December 1998: the court found that the victims had died of asphyxiation. Following a nationwide review of all Scottish court buildings, Historic Environment Scotland listed the building at Category C in 2015.

    "text": "HMS Ark Royal R09 was an Audacious-class aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy and, when she was decommissioned in 1979, was the Royal Navys last remaining conventional catapult and arrested-landing aircraft carrier. She was the first aircraft carrier to be equipped with an angled flight deck at its commissioning; her sister ship, HMS Eagle, was the Royal Navys first angle-decked aircraft carrier after modification in 1954. Ark Royal was the only non-United States vessel to operate the McDonnell Douglas Phantom at sea.  Construction and modifications  Ark Royal was the sister ship to HMS Eagle, which was initially named HMS Audacious, hence the name of the class. Four Audacious-class ships were laid down, but two HMS Africa and the original HMS Eagle were cancelled when the Second World War ended, and construction of the other two was suspended for several years. Both completed ships were extensively upgraded throughout their lifetimes. A contract was placed with Cammell Laird on the River Mersey on 19 March 1942, to build the first ship of the class. While it had been originally planned to name the ship Irresistible, this was changed to Ark Royal before ordering to commemorate the aircraft carrier lost in 1941. The ship, which was the largest warship ever to be built by Cammell Laird, was laid down at Lairds Birkenhead shipyard on 3 May 1943, as yard number 1119. Construction was slow, and was suspended after the end of the Second World War to allow the ships design to be updated to better suit her for the operation of modern aircraft. Ark Royal was launched by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, on 3 May 1950. She was completed on 25 February 1952, and commissioned the next day at Devonport. In this time, she underwent redesign and, when completed, she was markedly different from her sister ship. Shortly before her launch from the Cammell Laird shipyard, an image of the ship painted with her white undercoat was captured by the pictorialist photographer E. Chambré Hardman. This has been exhibited many times under the name Where Great Ships Are Built and later Birth of the Ark Royal. When commissioned, she had a 5.5 partially angled flight deck, two steam catapults capable of launching aircraft weighing up to 30,000 pounds 14,000 kilograms, a deck-edge lift on the port side the first British ship to be fitted with such a device, modified armament, and the new mirror landing system. Ark Royal was the first ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck and steam catapults, as opposed to having them added after launching. These innovations allowed aircraft to land and take off from the carrier at the same time. Her flight deck as built was 800 by 112 feet 244 by 34 metres. A further four years passed before she commenced her sea trials. About a year after commissioning, her forward port 4.5 inches 110 mm guns were removed to improve aircraft operations over the angled deck. Four years later, the port deck-edge lift and the forward starboard 4.5 inch guns were also removed. After the 1964 refit, only one twin 4.5 inch gun mount remained aft on port and starboard side. From 1967 to February 1970, she underwent a refit which was a major rebuild to her structure, but only an austere update to her electronic equipment, and was confined to changes needed to operate the RNs version of the Phantom. Prior to, and during the refit, concerns over costs, the age of the hull, and changing political opinions over naval requirements threatened the refit, and even a possibility that the ship could be scrapped. However, convincing arguments to retain and upgrade the carrier won through. The refit cost around 30 million, far less than the modernisation of Eagle, but also added several improvements, which allowed her to comfortably operate the larger Phantom and Buccaneer Mk.2 aircraft. Her modifications included a full 8.5 angled flight deck, new and far more powerful steam catapults, bridle-catchers, heavy-grade jet-blast deflectors both of which Eagle did not receive, and heavy-weight arrestor cables. Twelve hundred miles of new cabling was installed, but the ship was not completely rewired and retained old DC electrics. A modified island with a different arrangement from Eagle, and a partially new electronic suite were also added, though some of her original radars, such as 983 height-finders were retained, and she did not receive the 3-D air-search radar set that her sister had fitted, instead two double-array 966 versions of the standard RN 965 long-range system were fitted and one of the new 986 sets. Significantly, Ark Royal was the first and only RN carrier fitted with a USN carrier approach system, the ANSPN-35 radar, increasing night aircraft operational capability and safety. Her flight deck size was increased port aft, giving her extra deck-park space for her air group that Eagle did not have. She was also fitted for four Seacat missile launchers,",

    "text": "The Trial of Werner Rohde and Eight Others was the trial of several members of the Nazi regime in Germany for the execution of British agents without a trial. With the exception of Rohde himself, none were sentenced to death, and a few received relatively short sentences, which, in some cases, were not served as they were released after the trial by the French authorities.  Background information and proceedings  On 28 April 1946, nine members of the concentration camp staff at Natzweiler-Struthof were charged with the murders of four British women before coming to trial on 29 May 1946. Wolfgang Zeuss, Magnus Wochner, Emil Meier, Peter Straub, Fritz Hartjenstein, Franz Berg, Werner Rohde, Emil Bruttel, and Kurt Aus Dem Bruch were all accused of capital murder of British women sent to aid liaison officers in France. These women assisted in establishing communications between the resistance movement in France and London. The names of the victims were Andrée Borrel, Sonia Olschanezky, Vera Leigh and Diana Rowden. Two of these women were a part of the Womens Auxiliary Air Force and the other two were a part of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. All four were sent by the SOE for French resistance efforts. Thought to be spies of the Allied Powers, the Nazi regime detained them and eventually imprisoned them in the Natzweiler Camp. There, these women were allegedly inhumanely killed by lethal injection and then cremated while still living without trial. Major Bill Barkworth of the SAS and Vera Atkins of the SOE were in charge of the prosecution. Though under Articles 29 and 30 of the Hague Convention of 1907 the women were considered spies and therefore legally liable to execution, Article 30 states that no spy can be punished by execution until a trial has found them guilty. The Allied prosecution argued that the secrecy around the executions and the status of the prisoners as in protective custody proved that no such trial had taken place.  Defendants arguments and charges  Source: All of the accused were officials at the Natzweiler Camp except for Franz Berg who was imprisoned at the camp and worked the oven in the crematory. Horst Kopkow was the head of counterintelligence and was responsible for all SOE agents captured in France at the time. Kopkow was never tried because he had not yet been captured at the time of the investigation. By 1946, he had been captured and was in British custody but was thought to have died of bronchial pneumonia. In 1948, the Allies realised that he had been sent to aid in Counterintelligence efforts against the Soviets for uses in the Cold War. Fritz Hartjenstein was the Kommandant of the Natzweiler Camp and claimed that he was not present at the camp during the time of the executions and stated he had no idea that they were given the lethal injections. However, evidence was found that he was at a party in the camp during the same day of the killings. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life and then tried again for the hanging of a pilot in Natzweiler. He was sentenced to death and then extradited to France for another trial for the mass murder of prisoners. He was sentenced to death, but died on death row of a heart attack in 1954. Werner Rohde was a medical officer at the Natzweiler Camp and admitted that he was ordered by Officer Otto to inject one of the women. Officer Otto was found to not be an official at the camp and also evidence came out that Rohde was aware that the four British women never received a trial before the executions. Rohde was sentenced to death and was hanged on 11 October, 1946 at Hameln Germany. Officer Otto was never prosecuted because he had committed suicide when the war ended. Along with Rohde, Dr. Heinrich Plaza assisted in the executions using lethal injections. Plaza was never captured. In 1954, he was sentenced to death in absentia in France, but continued to live and practise as a doctor in Altötting Bavaria. He died in 1968. Peter Straub was the SS officer in command for the executions. According to testimony Straub was said to be drunk the night of the executions because of a party thrown for the departure of Plaza. Straub was known to have bragged about injections given to other prisoners in the camp. Straub was executed on 11 October, 1946. Franz Berg was a prisoner in the camp who operated the crematorium oven. Berg was a recognised criminal with a record of up to 22 crimes. He stated that he never knew that anyone unusual was being cremated and that he was locked in his cell when the injections were being administered. He went on to state a fellow prisoner told him what was happening as the murders were taking place. His defence argument was that Straub told him to heat up the furnaces because he was in charge. Berg was sentenced to five years in prison. He was later found guilty at the Natzweiler trial and executed. Magnus Wochner was the political head of the Natzweiler Camp and was directly under orders of the Berl",

    "text": "Kipoi Greek: Κήποι, before 1928: Μπάγια, Bagia is a village in the region of Zagori. It belongs to the municipal unit of Tymfi, Ioannina regional unit, Greece. The village has the lowest altitude of all Zagori village and is surrounded by rivers. It is built on a rocky hill, in the southern end of Vikos Gorge.  Name  Linguist Kostas Oikonomou writes the placename Bagia is related to the Albanian word bajë, baja bath, a term philologist Franz Miklosich says cannot be attributed with certainty to any language. On the contrary, linguist Gustav Meyer relates the word to the Slavic banja bath from the Romanian baje mine, bathing place, source of mineral water. Oikonomou states the origin of the toponym is either directly from the Albanian noun bathing place, as there are many ponds in the village suitable for bathing, especially in the summer when the river water ceases to flow and is concentrated only in them, or from the personal name Bagias and Vagias which are considered to be of Albanian origin. The new Greek name Kipoi is taken from a nearby toponym for fields where potatoes and other agricultural crops are cultivated.  History and culture  Kipoi was once the centre of Zagori. After the Balkan Wars and the liberation of Epirus in 1913, the people of Kipi demanded that Kipoi becomes the capital of Zagori, because it is the most central village and because it once was the capital. In Kipoi, the traditional architectural style of Epirus is well preserved, with stone built roads and dwellings. The village is surrounded by stone bridges. In the entrance lies Kontodimos bridge, down in the valley, the beautiful Milos bridge connects the village to the old water mill and Petsonis bridge in the exit towards Fragades. One can find more bridges on the old paths towards Elati, Dikorfo, Negades and Tsepelovo. Not far from the villages lies a three arched stone bridge, of the 18th century illustration. The bridge is also a unique tourist attraction of today, on the local road to central Zagori, just out of the village. Orthodox Albanians, locally called Arvanites, settled the village after the 15th century, later assimilating into the local population. Sarakatsani settled at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the museum of the famous collector Agapios Tolis is located in Kipoi, where more than 40.000 exhibits are included.  Bibliography  Kahl, Thede 1999.

Life  He was the eldest son of Sir Charles Pole, 1st Baronet of Wolverton originally Charles Van Notten, a London banker, and his wife Millicent Pole, daughter of Charles Pole 16951779. His paternal grandfather Charles Van Notten 17021750 of Amsterdam moved to London in 1720 and married Susanna Bosanquet. Sir Peter Pole succeeded his father in 1813. He and his brother Charles had worked in the family Van Notten Bank of Devonshire Square, Bishopsgate since 1795, and the bank came to trade as Peter and Charles Van Notten and Co. In 1815 Pole became a partner in another bank, Down, Thornton  Free of Birchin Lane off Lombard Street. Keen to enter Parliament, Pole through his partner Peter Free consulted James Brogden about obtaining a pocket borough. He stood unsuccessfully for Tregony in 1818. When John Taylor resigned his Yarmouth seat in 1819, Pole took it on, the patron Sir Leonard Thomas Worsley-Holmes, 9th Baronet already having a seat. Pole was a prominent figure of the panic of 1825, the family bank Peter and Charles Van Notten and Co. failing in December 1825. His personal fortune was largely unaffected, but he withdrew from politics in 1826.  Family  Pole married in 1798 Anna Guilhelmina Buller, whose Portuguese middle name is variously spelled.  Notes",

    "text": "Fontenelle Dam was built between 1961 and 1964 on the Green River in southwestern Wyoming. The 139-foot 42 m high zoned earthfill dam impounds the 345,360-acre-foot 0.42600 km3 Fontenelle Reservoir. The dam and reservoir are the central features of the Seedskadee Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the Fontenelle impoundment primarily as a storage reservoir for the Colorado River Storage Project. The dam suffered a significant failure in 1965, when the dams right abutment developed a leak. Emergency releases from the dam flooded downstream properties, but repairs to the dam were successful. However, in 1983 the dam was rated poor under Safety Evaluation of Existing Dams SEED criteria, due to continuing seepage, leading to an emergency drawdown. A concrete diaphragm wall was built through the core of the dam to stop leakage.  Use  Initially conceived as a storage reservoir for irrigation water, the project was suspended for a time in 1962 to pursue a study of high-altitude irrigation methods. The results of the studies caused the cancellation of many irrigation features for the project. The primary project rationale evolved to support Wyoming water rights in the Colorado River basin, retaining water that would otherwise go downstream to states in the lower Colorado basin. The dam provides power generation as a secondary feature. One motivation for the deferral of irrigation activities was the discovery of trona in the southern portion of the proposed irrigated region. As the extraction of trona was a higher-value activity, the removal of those lands from the project made the irrigation project nonviable.  Construction  Development of the upper Green River basin was included in a 1946 Bureau of Reclamation report on the Colorado River basin. A 1950 supplementary report dealt with details of the proposed Seedskadee Project, followed by another addendum in 1953. The Colorado River Storage Project, including the Seedskadee Project, was authorized by Congress in 1956. Initial planning was completed in 1959, and amended in 1961 to increase the capacity of Fontenelle Reservoir to 345,400 acre-feet 0.4260 km3, making the construction of a powerplant feasible. Work was stopped on irrigation infrastructure in 1962. The dam featured unusually large outlet works, capable of discharging 18,000 cu fts 510 m3s compared with a spillway capacity of 20,200 cu fts 570 m3s because the outlet works could be increased in size at lower cost than the spillway. The first element of construction at Fontenelle Dam was the building of the Fortenelle community, the base camp for construction, with work starting in 1961 to build prefabricated relocatable houses for dam workers. The contract for the base camp was awarded to and completed by the D.H. Butcher  Co. construction company. The construction contract for the dam was awarded on June 13, 1961 to Foley Brothers, Inc. and the Holland Construction Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, with construction starting on June 30, at a cost of 7.9 million. The surface of the bedrock at the dams base was found to be fragmented so the cut-off trench intended to preclude water infiltrating under the dam was deepened by 6 feet 1.8 m. The exposed rock was not prepared or smoothed with concrete. The foundation grouting required an unusually large amount of material to fill cracks in the upper 65 feet 20 m, with additional grouting required at the right abutment and outlet works. Work on the dam was completed by the end on 1963, with final completion on April 24, 1964. Work on the powerplant started in 1963, with completion in 1965.  Partial failure  Problems with the embankment became apparent in May 1964, when part of the backfill slid into the stilling basin downstream, attributed to too-fast lowering of the reservoir level. When the reservoir had filled to 10 of capacity, seepage became apparent at the dams base, with further seepage observed about 4,000 feet 1,200 m below the dam from shale outcroppings. In July 1965 another slide occurred in the area of the stilling basin. A significant leak appeared on September 3, 1965 at the west abutment, starting as a wet spot that grew with time. The weakened downstream face lost 10,000 cubic yards 7,600 m3 of material that slid into the stilling basin, accompanied by continuing water flow, a condition known as hydraulic piping. Work began the next day to lower the reservoir, with a 24-hour watch on the dam. The wet spot became a waterspout, flowing at a rate of between 10 and 12 million gallons per day. On September 6 a 15-foot 4.6 m by 20-foot 6.1 m sinkhole developed on the upstream face of the dams crest, which workers immediately filled with riprap bulldozed from the nearby dam surface into the hole. The hole was 30 feet 9.1 m deep, with the bottom 11 feet 3.4 m below the level of the reservoir, with only 45 feet 14 m of dam structure remaining between the sinkhole a",

    "text": "Georg Abraham Schneider 19 April 1770 - 19 January 1839 was a German musician and composer.  Biography  Schneider was born in Darmstadt, where he originally learnt music as a member of the citys alta cappella. From 1787 he played horn in the court orchestra of the nobel house Hessen-Darmstadt, then from 1795 for the Prussian royal court. Schneiders compositions and performances focussed on the horn, and owe a stylistic debt to Haydn and Mozart. The invention of the valved horn by Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blühmel was of great interest to Schneider, allowing the instrument to be played chromatically for the first time. In a report for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in 1817, Schneider wrote; Because of its full and strong, yet soft and attractive tone, the Waldhorn is an extremely beautiful instrument; but, as is well known, it has until now been far behind almost all other wind instruments in its development, being very restricted to its natural notes .... Herr Stölzel of Breslau has now completely removed these shortcomings .... He has simply provided his horn with two airtight valves, which are depressed with little effort by two fingers of the right hand, like the keys of the pianoforte, and restored to their previous position by the same two fingers with the help of attached springs; with these it is not only possible but also easy to produce a pure and completely chromatic scale from the lowest to the highest notes with a perfectly even tone. On this horn, therefore, there is no need to change from one key to another, and the same passage can be repeated immediately in a different key; even passages which previously were absolutely impossible to play on the normal horn can now be performed without difficulty. The development of these valves led to the development of the instrument now known as the French horn. Schneider wrote the first work for valved horn, which was performed publicly in 1818. In 1820 he was promoted to royal director of music, then in 1825 appointed director of the Court Orchestra. In his later life he taught at the Prussian Academy of the Arts. Schneiders daughter Maschinka married Dresden composer François Schubert, and they had a daughter, singer and composer Georgina Schubert. He died in Berlin in 1839.

    "text": "Pseudeuophrys lanigera is a species of jumping spider family Salticidae that is distributed throughout Europe.  Description  Males reach a body length of three to four millimeters, with females up to five mm. This species is very similar to Pseudeuophrys erratica, which is rarer and found below the bark of trees on forest fringes. As P. lanigera is mostly found inside buildings, adults can be found even in deep winter. It is better suited to the dry climate of modern concrete architecture than other salticids in the area like Salticus scenicus. Adults can be found the whole year.  Distribution  P. lanigera is distributed in western and southern Europe, eastward to the Caucasus. In Germany this species is most often observed inside houses, or on the external walls of buildings, indicating it is synanthropic at least in some parts of its range. A first find in Romania was published in 2007, and in Poland the first find was in 1999. Originally this species was distributed in Southwest Europe, and was first found in Germany in the 1950s, where it is now found only in or near human dwellings.  Biology  P. lanigera has been observed feeding on booklice such as Liposcelis.  Name  The species name lanigera means wool-bearing; the genus name looking like pseud good eu eyebrows ophrys. Euophrys beautiful eyebrows is another genus from which Pseudeuophrys has been split off.

    "text": "The V-Roys were a Knoxville, Tennessee-based alternative country band signed to E-Squared Records. The band was described as walking the fine line between rootsy country and cutting-edge alternative rock. Scott Miller, John Paul Keith, and Mic Harrison were the primary songwriters for the band.  History  The band was formed in Knoxville in 1994, with guitaristvocalist Scott Miller, lead guitarist John Paul Keith, bassist Paxton Sellers, and drummer Jeff Bills. They were originally named The Viceroys, but were forced to change it after being threatened with a lawsuit from a Jamaican band. Before their first album was recorded, Keith left the band and was replaced by Mic Harrison.  Releases  The V-Roys first album, Just Add Ice was the first release on Steve Earles E-Squared Records. The title is a playful reference to their decision to remove the letters ice from The Viceroys as a result of the threatened lawsuit. The album is described as a solid reflection of their live show and jangling, melancholy countryrock. The band recorded it live without a lot of bells and whistles, to get something out as quick as we could and go out and support it. 1998s All About Town is a more subtle, but endlessly melodic album that saw the band stretch out and add elements of bluegrass and broader production values. Miller commented that Earle pushed us a lot harder and put his foot way up our asses this time, and handed songs back to us if they werent good enough. Allmusic describes the album as twelve concise songs that swing from the Creedence-ish Window Song to the country-folk of Mary to the sounds of Appalachia in Virginia Way to the great highway tune of Strange. Both of the bands studio albums were produced by Steve Earle and Ray Kennedy, known as the Twangtrust. The band also had 3 tracks on the soundtrack to the film You Can Count on Me. After road-weariness, Earle losing interest, and reaching their creative peak, the band decided to break up. They released a live album, Are You Through Yet?, recorded at a concert at the Down Home in Johnson City, Tennessee. The album is complimented as a marvelous send-off, but it also provides a fine introduction to the group for those who missed them the first time around. The band played what was then called their final show at the historic Tennessee Theatre on New Years Eve, 1999.  Reunion  In July 2011, it was announced that the band then would be releasing a compilation album on Millers record label. The album, Sooner or Later features songs from their two studio albums, and previously unreleased tracks. They also played a concert on New Years Eve 2011 in Knoxville. The show was called One Show; Goodbye.  Reception  The band was described as a critically acclaimed, commercially under appreciated band with a tasty brand of roots rock. Their live show was often complimented. It was illustrated as shows that swung from honky-tonk pathos to punk-ish ferocity, and by the end of a show it was sometimes hard to tell one from the other. The band was particularly popular locally; shows were described as genuine events, with advance tickets, sold-out clubs. Just Add Ice was said to be the best selling album in ten years at a Knoxville record store. The V-Roys were named the best Knoxville band ever in a 2009 poll conducted by Knoxvilles weekly newspaper Metro Pulse. The voters were members of the Knoxville music industry.

    "text": "The German Alpine Club German: Deutscher Alpenverein, DAV for short is the worlds largest climbing association and the eighth-largest sporting association in Germany. It is a member of the German Olympic Sports Confederation and the competent body for sport and competition climbing, hiking, mountaineering, hill walking, ice climbing, mountain expeditions, as well as ski mountaineering. It is an association made up of local branches known as sections.  History  The German Alpine Club was founded as Bildungsbürgerlicher Bergsteigerverein on 9 May 1869 in Munich by 36 former members of the Austrian Alpine Club around the Ötztal curate Franz Senn. It was founded in order to promote the development of tourism in the Eastern Alps through the building of mountain huts, and establishment of hiking trails, and via ferratas. The association had a large membership from the beginning, attracting 1,070 members in the first ten months. The German and the Austrian societies merged in 1873 to form the German and Austrian Alpine Club DÖAV. By the late 19th century, the associations policies became increasingly nationalistic and anti-Semitic. In 1899, the Brandenburg section amended an Aryan paragraph to exclude non-Christian members, followed by the Vienna section in 1905 and the Alpine associations of Vienna in 1907 and Munich in 1910. After World War I, Jewish members, including Viktor Frankl and Fred Zinnemann, who made up one third of the membership, were banned in most branches. They, in turn, established a separate Donauland section, insisting on recognition by the DÖAV. The Donauland members were officially ousted in 1924. Jews were even banned from using the DÖAV mountain huts. Following Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, the DÖAV, under the leadership of Arthur Seyss-Inquart, was renamed as the Deutscher Alpenverein DAV and was incorporated into the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise as its mountaineering association. After World War II, the DAV was dissolved by the Allied authorities. Its assets were held by the Austrian Alpine Club, acting as trustees. The German Alpine Club was re-established in 1952. It joined the Deutscher Sportbund in 1992. After leaving the Union Internationale des Associations dAlpinisme in 2008 due to differences of opinion regarding competitive and recreational sports, the German and Austrian Alpine Clubs rejoined the Union Internationale des Associations dAlpinisme in 2013.  Structure  The DAV is an umbrella organization comprising 356 legally independent regional sections with a total of around 1.5 million members. Every branch is a registered voluntary association Eingetragener Verein, e.V. in its own right and solely responsible for admitting members. The collective body of the branches is represented by the general assembly, association council, and presidium. The primary task of the Club is the maintenance of its mountain huts through its sections which currently provide 325 alpine club huts for hikers and mountaineers as well as 220 indoor climbing gyms. The DAV publishes DAV Panorama magazine, Alpine Club maps and Alpine Club Guides in cooperation with Bergverlag Rother, organises hill walks and alpine-style tours, makes mountaineering equipment available to rent and arranges collective insurance. It also runs the Alpine Museum on Prater Island in Munich. In recent years, the Clubs policies have shifted towards habitat conservation, with a particular focus on the protection of the fauna and flora of the Alps.

    "text": "The Book of the War is a hypertext, multi-author novel presented in the form of an encyclopedia of the first fifty years of the War in Heaven in the Faction Paradox universe, which is based on Doctor Who lore and canon. The book was edited and written by Lawrence Miles, and co-authors include Simon Bucher-Jones, Daniel OMahony, Ian McIntire, Mags L. Halliday, Helen Fayle, Philip Purser-Hallard, Kelly Hale, Jonathan Dennis, and Mark Clapham.  Content  Despite there being various plots and subplots within the book, it is primarily a guide to the many important factions involved with the War in Heaven. These include Faction Paradox itself, the Great Houses, the Celestis, the Remote, and Posthumanity. A number of hints about the mysterious Enemy against whom the Great Houses are fighting are scattered throughout the text, but nothing conclusive is ever stated. The book details many individuals, events, technologies, and concepts related to the War. The book makes references to the Doctor Who novels Alien Bodies, Interference, The Taking of Planet 5, and The Shadows of Avalon, and it features the characters Compassion and Chris Cwej, who first appeared in Interference and Original Sin. A number of other parallels with Doctor Who characters and concepts can be found, but these links are not explicit. No familiarity with Doctor Who is required to appreciate The Book of the War. Characters and settings from The Book of the War appear in later Faction Paradox novels including Of the City of the Saved..., Warring States and Newtons Sleep, and the short story anthology A Romance in Twelve Parts.  See also  The otherwise unrelated novel Dictionary of the Khazars is a rare example of similar use of a non-linear encyclopedic structure for a work of fiction.  References",

She is a Canadian art historian who places curatorial collaboration at the centre of her practice.  Career  Bruce was born and grew up in Montreal. She received her Honours BA in Art History from Queens University, Kingston 1989 and her MA in Canadian Art History from Carleton University, Ottawa 1999. From 1991 to 1992, she served as Acting Registrar of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Queens University, then went to the Art Gallery of Hamilton AGH, as Registrar in 1993. She was appointed Curator of Historical Art in 1999 and in 2015, Director of Exhibitions and Collections. She has focused on Canadian historical art in exhibitions ranging from biography with her show of the Canadian artist Harriet Ford 2001 to her exhibition and publication on the history of the Art Gallery of Hamiltons historical Canadian collection Lasting Impressions: celebrated works from the Art Gallery of Hamilton 2005 which she co-authored to her co-curated exhibition William Kurelek: The Messenger 2011 which was the first retrospective of his art in a quarter century and the largest ever mounted. In the same year, she also co-curated The French Connection: Canadians at the Paris Salons, 18801900. In 2014, after three years of research and two trips to Sweden and France, she curated her major retrospective and co-authored the book Into the Light: The Paintings of William Blair Bruce 18591906, to examine the artist from different viewpoints indigenous included to achieve diversity. In 2015, she co-curated The Artist Herself: Self-Portraits by historical Canadian women artists 2015 with Alicia Boutilier of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. This exhibition expanded the genres definition by using not only the human face but other art forms to explore self-representation. Her 2021 exhibition Tom Thomson: The Art of Authentication co-curated and authored again with Boutilier, established criteria to authenticate a work of art, taking as its focus the work of Tom Thomson and exhibiting possible Thomsons and known fakes to illustrate the help authentication can provide. The exhibition was called a rewarding experience as an examination of authentication and forgery in art, using Tom Thomson as case in point. The show was rated one of the best exhibitions of the season by the Art Institute of Canada because it gave insight into the extensive problem-solving that museum professionals undertake in tracing authenticity. Bruce has contributed a chapter to Canada and Impressionism: New Horizons at the National Gallery of Canada 2019 and also has written entries to such exhibitions as Embracing Canada: Landscapes from Krieghoff to the Group of Seven, Vancouver Art Gallery 2015 and Uninvited, Canadian Women Artists in the Modern Movement, McMichael Canadian Art Collection 2021.

    "text": "USS Salmon SSRSSAGSS-573, a Sailfish-class submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the salmon.  Construction and commissioning  Salmon was the second of a class of two radar picket submarines, which were the largest conventionally-powered submarines in the United States Navy since the USS Argonaut SM-1 of 1928. She was equipped with BPS-2 and BPS-3 radars in and aft of the sail. Intended to scout in advance of aircraft carrier groups using long-range radar, the Sailfish class were designed for a high surface speed. However, they achieved a speed only a few knots higher than converted World War II radar picket submarines. Salmon was laid down on 10 March 1954 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 25 February 1956, sponsored by Mrs. Albert M. Bontier, widow of Commander A. M. Bontier, who was lost during World War II when the submarine USS Seawolf SS-197 was sunk during a war patrol in the South Pacific early in October 1944. Salmon was commissioned on 26 August 1956.  Service history   19561959  Salmon conducted her shakedown cruise between 19 February and 10 May 1957, ranging from Newport, Rhode Island, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She departed Portsmouth for the West Coast in late May, transited the Panama Canal on 3 July; visited Callao, Peru; and proceeded to San Diego, California, arriving on 25 July. Salmon conducted local operations in southern California waters, as a unit of Submarine Division 33 SubDiv 33, until she began her first western Pacific deployment on 23 September. She sailed via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island to join the Seventh Fleet off southern Japan on 19 October. For the remainder of the year she participated in fleet training exercises and special operations, with port calls at Yokosuka, Japan; Hong Kong; Manila and Subic Bay, Philippines; and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Salmon departed Yokosuka on 31 March 1958 and returned to San Diego, California, on 19 April. Resuming local operations, Salmon remained in the San Diego area for the rest of the year. From 6 January 1959 until 30 May, she underwent overhaul and limited conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Giving up a large radome from her superstructure, she gained instrumented Regulus missileguidance capability and improved, longer range sonar. Salmon then prepared for her second WestPac deployment. Salmon departed San Diego, California, on 17 July and sailed to Pearl Harbor where her crew received Regulus missile guidance training, then proceeded to Japan and joined Seventh Fleet on 21 August. She operated with the fleet in Allied training exercises, provided services for other Seventh Fleet surface and subsurface units for training purposes, and made visits to various ports, before returning to San Diego on 14 February 1960.  19601970  Through 1960 and 1961, Salmon operated from San Diego, California, with occasional visits to San Francisco, California, Astoria, Oregon, Tacoma, Washington, Port Angeles, Washington, and Esquimalt, British Columbia. On 1 March 1961, she was reclassified an attack submarine and given hull classification symbol SS-573, and, on 1 November, she was reassigned to SubDiv 52. The submarine radar picket mission ended fleetwide at this time as airborne radar superseded it with the full deployment of the Grumman WF-2 Tracer. On 1 June 1962, Salmon departed San Diego for her third WestPac deployment. She visited Papeete, Tahiti, from 13 to 16 June, then proceeded to Yokosuka for duty with Seventh Fleet. She subsequently operated with antisubmarine warfare ASW hunter-killer groups in fleet exercises and often engaged in free-play battle problems with individual surface units. During this deployment, she visited Hakodate and Sasebo, Japan; Naha, Okinawa and Hong Kong. Salmon returned to San Diego, California, on 20 December and became flagship of Submarine Flotilla 1; and, in addition to that distinction, was awarded the Golden E for excellence in battle efficiency for the past five consecutive years, which rated her as the leading submarine of her division. Salmon was the first submarine to earn a Golden E and was to better that record by winning hashmarks signifying retention of that status during 1963 and 1964. On the fourth of July in 1963, the Salmon suffered personnel casualties when mercury from a broken thermometer came into contact with a hot grid, creating toxic mercury vapor, resulting in the poisoning of 14 crewmembers. On 3 June of the latter year, she put into the San Francisco Naval Shipyard to undergo FRAM II conversion. Departing the yard on 19 April 1965, as a modernized GUPPY III, she moved to the Puget Sound, Washington, area for evaluation and sound tests. She then returned to San Diego, to resume local operations, on 4 May. Salmon commenced her fourth WestPac deployment on 23 August. She joined Submarine Flotilla SubFlot 7 of the Seventh Fleet on 14 September and conducted operat",

Its ruins have been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1957.  History  Under Minamoto no Yoritomo, Doi Sanehira was awarded for his achievements in the Genpei War against the Heike clan, and was appointed governor of the three provinces of Bizen, Bitchu and Bingo. Sanehiras son Enpei took the name of Kobayakawa, which was the place name of his residence, but was subsequently awarded the Numata shōen in Aki Province for his distinguished service in the Jōkyū War and relocated to Aki. His grandson, Kobayakawa Shigehira completed Takayama Castle in 1206 as the clans stronghold. The Nuta Kobayakawa clan was the main line and ruled from Takayama Castle, and the Takehara Kobayakawa clan was a cadet branch. From the middle of the 16th century, the Ouchi clan, which ruled Suo and Nagato Provinces became the strongest warlord in the western half of Japan, supported by its monopoly of foreign trade. The Takahara-Kobayakawa gained in power through an alliance with the Ouchi, whereas the Nuta-Kobayakawa was rent by internal conflicts. Takayama Castle was on the front line of the conflict between the Ouchi clan and their aggressive neighbors to the north, the Amago clan. In defending against the Amago, the Nuta Kobayakawa clan lost three consecutive leaders in youth by illness or battle. In 1540, when the Amago again invaded Aki, the Takehara-Kobayakawa switched sides, but the Amago were defeated. The Ouchi clan seized Takayama Castle and much of the Kobayakawa territory. Around this time, the inlet to the Seto Inland Sea became silted up, adding to the clans financial woes. In 1541, the head of the Takehara-Kobayakawa branch Kobayakawa Okikage died without an heir, so the clan adopted the third son of Mōri Motonari as Kobayakawa Takakage in 1544. On the other hand, the head of the Nuta-Kobayakawa clan Kobayakawa Shigehira was young and in such poor health that he became blind, so he was forced into retirement, and Kobayakawa Takakage united the two branches in 1550. In 1552, he relocated his stronghold to a new castle, Niitakayama Castle on the opposite side of the Nuta River, and the Takayama Castle was abandoned. Takayama Castle was built on Mount Tsumataka, a 150-meter height overlooking the Nuta River, about 10 kilometers west of current center of Mihara city. On the opposite of the river is Mount Niitaka of similar height, and these two mountains stand like the pillars of gate. Originally there was an inlet with a length of over 10 kilometers from current river mouth on the Seto Inland Sea to just the below of the castle. This was an important port for the clan, which was also a maritime power on the Seto Inland Sea. Mount Tsumataka has two lines of ridges extending north and south. The northern ridge is the core part of the castle, which consisted of several enclosures protected by stone walls and dry moats. The total size of the castle was about 600 meter long and 400 meter wide. At present, no structures of the castle survive. The site is a 20-minute walk from JR West Hongō Station.

    "text": "The Mysterious Monsters also known as Bigfoot: The Mysterious Monster is a 1976 documentary film written and directed by Robert Guenette about the cryptids Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Yeti. It contained content from Guenettes made-for-TV movie Monsters! Mysteries or Myths? that aired on CBS on November 25, 1974. That version had been produced by David L. Wolper in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and was narrated by Rod Serling. The Mysterious Monsters was one of the first theatrical releases produced by Sunn Classic Pictures. It was narrated by actor Peter Graves. The film investigated not only the possibility of Bigfoots existence but also of the Loch Ness Monster and the Yeti the Abominable Snowman. It featured dramatic reenactments of various reported Bigfoot sightings. The film showed one witness being given a lie detector test, another being placed under hypnosis. The Mysterious Monsters was the first movie to feature the home movie taken by Roger Patterson in 1967 reported to show a Bigfoot. Anthropologist Grover Krantz was interviewed and said he believed the film to be authentic. Famed Bigfoot hunter Peter C. Byrne was also featured and gave insights on the hunt. In discussing the Loch Ness Monster, the film showed a 1934 photograph that was said to be of the creature. In 1994, however, this photo was proven to be a hoax. Robert and Frances Guenette are credited as the authors of a 160-page book adaption of the film. The film was later featured in an episode of Cinema Insomnia.  DVD release  On September 22, 2009, Cheezy Flicks released the film on DVD. In 2010, Apprehensive Films made the Cinema Insomnia version available also on DVD. The DVD cover is a visual reference to the 1978 Marvel Star Wars comic Star Wars 13: Day of the Dragon Lords.  See also  Bigfoot in popular culture Peter C.

    "text": "The Dequindre Cut is a below-grade pathway, formerly a Grand Trunk Western Railroad line, located on the east side of Detroit, Michigan, just west of St. Aubin Street. Much of the Cut has been converted to a greenway; the colorful graffiti along the pathway has been left in place.  Description  The railroad line that once ran through the Dequindre Cut runs roughly northwestsoutheast at street level through Hamtramck and on to Royal Oak. The Cut begins south of Mack Avenue and runs along the east edge of the Eastern Market. The grade separation gradually increases heading south. It eventually reaches and stays 25 feet beneath grade until it enters the riverfront area south of Jefferson Avenue. A substantial portion of the Cut has been converted into a greenway. The greenway runs from Mack Avenue south to Woodbridge Street, between Jefferson Avenue and the Detroit River. The Dequindre Trail connects the Cut between Woodbridge Street and the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor along the International Riverfront. The greenway currently houses a paved path with separate lanes for both pedestrians and bicycles. Access ramps to the Cut have been constructed at Lafayette Street, Gratiot Avenue, and Wilkins Street. Graffiti on the bridge abutments along the trail were intentionally left in place during the construction of the greenway.  History  The rail line was built in the 1830s by the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad, a predecessor of Canadian National Railway subsidiary Grand Trunk Western Railroad. By the 1920s, there were over 400 industries operating on Detroits east side. However, the combination of the citys haphazard street plan, the expansion of large factories, and the substantial network of rail tracks conspired to slow traffic within the city, particularly in the east-west direction. In 1923, the city of Detroit and the railroad began a plan to build 22 grade separations; both parties agreed to share the cost. One of the tracks to be regraded was the line paralleling St. Aubin. These tracks ran from the northwest, where they connected with a network of other lines, to the southeast, where the tracks turned to parallel the river and supplied a number of large factories, including the Detroit-Michigan Stove Plant, the United States Rubber Company Plant, and the Parke-Davis Research Laboratory. The tracks terminated at the Brush Street Station in downtown Detroit. By March 1930, sixteen of the crossings of the Dequindre Cut were finished, including the Chestnut Street Bridge; the nearby Antietam Avenue Bridge was completed soon thereafter. These two bridges are particularly significant in their illustration of the construction of the time and their relationship to the right-of-way below. As the century progressed, rail usage declined. Passenger service through the Cut was discontinued in 1982, and freight service continued only a few years beyond that. In 1998-2000, Canadian National sold the 3.5-mile section of track including the Cut south of their main line. During this time of abandonment, the Dequindre Cut was used by graffiti artists, attracted by the concrete bridge abutments and overpasses which protected the art from the weather, as well as the out-of-the-way location. The resulting art included some graffiti masterpieces. These pieces of art have continued since the transformation of the railway, such as a pair of murals created by the Hygienic Dress League Corporation. In the late 1990s, when casinos were first authorized to be built in Detroit, the Dequindre Cut was considered as a freeway access to their proposed riverfront location. However, the casinos were built elsewhere, leaving the fate of the Dequindre Cut open. In 2003, the GreenWays Initiative granted the Downtown Detroit Partnership 98,750 to put plans in motion to remake the Dequindre Cut as a greenway. The project was later funded by another 3.4 million in grants, and groundbreaking began in 2005. The first stretch of greenway, a 1.2mile section encompassing most of the Dequindre Cut, opened in 2009. Construction began in September 2013 to build the remaining greenway half mile section from Mack Avenue to Gratiot. This segment includes a trail entrance into Eastern Market along the northwest side of the Wilkins Street bridge. This extension is part of the Link Detroit project which is funded through various sources including a 10 million TIGER grant. Though the greenway was originally due to be completed in 2014, unexpected underground utilities delayed its opening. The completed extension opened to the public in April 2016.

    "text": "Domino is a 2019 crime thriller film directed by Brian De Palma and starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Carice van Houten, Guy Pearce and Eriq Ebouaney. It is an international co-production filmed on-location across Europe. It tells the story of Danish police officer Christian Toft Coster-Waldau, who is seeking justice for the murder of his partner Lars Hansen by the vengeful Ezra Tarzi Ebouaney, hampered by his target being a CIA informant. In the United States, it was released direct-to-VOD on 31 May 2019 by Saban Films but received theatrical releases in other territories. It received generally negative reviews. De Palma has expressed discontent with the final film, revealing that considerable sections of the original script were not filmed as intended due to production issues.  Plot  Copenhagen police officers Christian Toft and Lars Hansen are sent to check out a reported domestic disturbance in an apartment. When they arrive, they find a man trying to leave the building with blood on his shoes. Toft assumes hes the domestic assailant and handcuffs him. Hansen sends Toft upstairs to go check on the mans wife when Toft realizes he accidentally left his gun at home. He takes Hansens and goes upstairs, only to find the apartment filled with firearms, plastic explosives and a man lying dead with his throat slit and fingers removed. Using a hidden knife, the assailant breaks free from his restraints and attacks Hansen, inadvertently cutting his throat. The wounded Hansen tells Toft to give chase before losing consciousness. Toft pursues the assailant across the rooftop, but both fall into several stories. While Toft lies incapacitated, he sees three men come up and knock the assailant out before taking him away. The police identify the assailant from fingerprints as Ezra Tarzi, a Libyan emigrant and former Special Forces operative whose parents had been killed by Salah Al-Din, an ISIS commander known as Sheikh. Al-Din, who smuggles weapons and explosives through a tomato importer based in Brussels, is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks which he films and edits before posting them online. Tarzis victim, Farooq Hares, was one of Al-Dins lieutenants, and Tarzi was trying to get to him. Toft wants to pursue Tarzi to bring him to justice but is suspended by his superior Detective Wold after he learns that Toft misplaced his service weapon, and is interrogated by internal affairs inspector Alex Boe. Meanwhile, Tarzi and his family have been abducted by CIA agent Joe Martin, who has relentlessly pursued Al-Din ever since he killed five of his colleagues years earlier. Martin pressures a reluctant Tarzi into working on his behalf by threatening to reveal his murderous deeds to his children. He sends him first after Hares nephew Yusuf in Copenhagen but during the struggle, Yusuf breaks loose and throws himself to his death. Tarzi manages to find several hidden cellphones in the apartment, from which Martin traces calls from a restaurant in Almería. They deduce that Al-Din intends to use a ferry to escape to friendly territory in North Africa, where hell be effectively untraceable. Tarzi travels to Almería and attempts to find Al-Din by torturing one of his underlings, but gets nothing. Despite being suspended, Toft remains resolute in finding Tarzi. Along with Boe, who also wants to avenge Hansen, the two travel unsupervised to Brussels, but during the drive receive a phone call from Hansens wife Hanne that Lars has died in hospice. Heartbroken, Boe reveals that she and Lars had been having an affair and hed been intending to divorce Hanne and start a family with her. When a shocked Toft pushes back, Boe reveals intimate photos of the two together and an ultrasound, indicating shes carrying his child. Toft and Boe fail to find leads in Brussels but learn that Tarzi has been spotted in Almería and quickly change course for southern Spain. As theyre driving from the airport, they spot one of Al-Dins tomato delivery trucks and Toft deduces the connection. They follow the truck, eventually stumbling across Al-Din himself in another. They follow him to a bullfighting arena, where he and several others splinter off into the ring and nearby building. Toft follows Al-Din to the roof of the building, while Boe follows the others into the arena, where she spots one of them causing a distraction while another gets into a strategic location. Al-Dins men fly a camera drone into the arena, intending to film their comrades suicide bombing. Just in the nick of time, Toft and Boe realize what is happening and intervene, shooting Al-Din in the process. Boe calls Wold, who in turn calls Martin, who proposes a tradeTarzi for Al-Din. They meet on the rooftop, but Al-Din dies from his wounds. A distraught Tarzi asks Toft to kill him, but Martin makes clear that he intends to use the vengeful assassin as an asset for years to come. Suddenly, Boe arrives and shoots and kills Tarzi, avenging Lars. A disappoint",

    "text": "Kanō Tanyū 狩野 探幽; Japanese pronunciation: ka.noː  taꜜɰ.jɯː, 4 March 1602  4 November 1674 was a Japanese painter of the Kanō school. One of the foremost Kanō painters of the Tokugawa period, many of the best known Kanō works today are by Tanyū.  Biography  His original given name was Morinobu; he was the eldest son of Kanō Takanobu and grandson of Kanō Eitoku. In 1617, Tanyū was appointed by the Tokugawa shogunate to become the shogunates first official painter. Over the following years, he was given many highly prestigious commissions. Over the 1620s and 1630s, he created a number of large-scale works for Edo Castle, Nijō Castle, Osaka Castle, Nagoya Castle, and Nikkō Tōshō-gū. Prolific in a variety of painting styles, Tanyūs most famous works are probably those he produced for these large-scale commissions. They are screens and panels, prime examples of the Momoyama style, depicting natural subjects such as tigers, birds and plants, in bright colors and with extensive use of gold leaf. The gold, often used to represent clouds, water, or other background elements, would reflect what little light was available indoors, brightening a castles dark rooms. Moreover his dignified portrayal of figures appear in Confucius and Two Disciples, a screen painting now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Tanyū was also accomplished, however, in monochrome ink painting based on the prototypical style of the Muromachi period, yamato-e compositions in a style similar to that of the Tosa school, and Chinese style scrolls. His most famous yamato-e work is a narrative handscroll depicting the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Tokugawa shōgun and major figure in Japanese history. It was after this commission, in 1640, that the artist first took on the artist name of Tanyū. His works decorated the walls of numerous palaces and castles, including Nijō Castle in Kyōto, the shoguns castle at Nagoya, and the Kyōto Imperial Palace. In addition to being a highly honored and respected painter in his own right, Tanyū was known as a collector and connoisseur of Chinese paintings. He made sketches and kept records of many of the paintings that passed through his studio, brought to him for authentication. He died in 1674 at the age of 72.

Habitat  It grows in the xeric fire-dependent habitats of the region, including longleaf pine sandhill and Florida scrub.  Conservation  The species is relatively widespread and can be locally abundant where suitable habitat persists. It, like other dry site endemics of the region, may face long-term threats due to habitat loss for real estate, agriculture, and pine silviculture. As an obligate heliophile, the species cannot persist in areas with closed canopy and low sunlight exposure, so additional threats include fire suppression and invasive species.  References",

    "text": "German submarine U-78 was a Type VIIC submarine of Nazi Germanys Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was the only German submarine to be sunk by land-based artillery fire during the war. Built by Bremen-Vegesack. She was ordered on 25 January 1939, and laid down on 28 March 1940, in the shipyard of Bremer Vulkan in the port city of Bremen-Vegesack as yard number 6. U-78 was launched on 7 December 1940 and formally commissioned into the Kriegsmarine as a school boat on 15 February 1941, with a crew of 41 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Alfred Dumrese.  Design  German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-78 had a displacement of 769 tonnes 757 long tons when at the surface and 871 tonnes 857 long tons while submerged. She had a total length of 67.10 m 220 ft 2 in, a pressure hull length of 50.50 m 165 ft 8 in, a beam of 6.20 m 20 ft 4 in, a height of 9.60 m 31 ft 6 in, and a draught of 4.74 m 15 ft 7 in. The submarine was powered by two MAN M 6 V 4046 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower 2,060 to 2,350 kW; 2,760 to 3,160 shp for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri  Cie GG UB 7208 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower 550 kW; 740 shp for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.23 m 4 ft propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres 750 ft. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.7 knots 32.8 kmh; 20.4 mph and a maximum submerged speed of 7.6 knots 14.1 kmh; 8.7 mph. When submerged, the boat could operate for 80 nautical miles 150 km; 92 mi at 4 knots 7.4 kmh; 4.6 mph; when surfaced, she could travel 8,500 nautical miles 15,700 km; 9,800 mi at 10 knots 19 kmh; 12 mph. U-78 was fitted with two 53.3 cm 21 in torpedo tubes at the bow, fourteen torpedoes, one 8.8 cm 3.46 in SK C35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a 2 cm 0.79 in C30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.  Service history  U-78 spent the majority of her career as a training U-boat, during which time she had several different crews. As a result, she never sank any enemy vessels nor engaged any enemy ships or convoys. On 1 March 1945, she was transferred to the 4th U-boat Flotilla but never saw any combat; prior to beginning her first patrol she was sunk on 16 April 1945. U-78s fate is notable in that she was the only German U-boat to be sunk by land-based artillery fire during World War II.  Use as a training boat  U-78 spent almost her entire career as part of the 22nd U-boat Flotilla as a school boat, a role which saw her being used to train U-boat crews. During this time, her commander was changed six times: in July 1941 from Kapitänleutnant Kptlt. Alfred Dumrese to Oberleutnant zur See OL Kurt Makowski, who remained in command until February 1942 when she was handed over to Kptlt. Max Bernd Dieterich; in July 1942, Kptlt. Ernst Ziehm took command of the U-boat from Dieterich in November 1942. Kptlt. Helmut Sommer took command from Ziehm in May 1943; the sixth commander of U-78 took control of the U-boat when Wilhelm Eisele was named captain and lastly, the seventh commander, OL Horst Hübsch, took command of U-78 from Eisele on 27 November 1944. All of U-78s changes of command took place while the U-boat was still serving as a training boat. Crewmembers used her as a practice submarine before being assigned to their operational U-boat.  Sinking  By March 1945, the war was coming to an end, the Kriegsmarine was faced with a dwindling number of active U-boats. To offset this, the Navy looked to transfer boats away from other duties, such as training. On 1 March 1945, U-78 began active service with the 4th U-boat Flotilla. Just a month and a half later, however, on 16 April 1945, U-78 was sunk after being attacked by Soviet land-based artillery while she was docked near the electricity supply pier in the German port of Pillau in East Prussia.

    "text": "The Cooper Basin is a Permian-Triassic sedimentary geological basin in Australia. The intracratonic rift basin is located mainly in the southwestern part of Queensland and extends into northeastern South Australia. It is named after the Cooper Creek which is an ephemeral river that runs into Lake Eyre. For most of its extent, it is overlain by the Eromanga Basin. It covers 130,000 km2. The surface of the Cooper Basin is mostly desert, including parts of the Simpson Desert, the Channel Country and Sturt Stony Desert. Oil and gas exploration of the basin began in 1962.  Energy resources   Oil and natural gas  The Cooper Basin has the most important on-shore petroleum and natural gas deposits in Australia. The oil and gas window is located 1,250 m below the surface and was originally discovered in the 1960s although there are larger oil and gas deposits off-shore. The first commercial discovery of gas occurred in 1963. It includes Australias largest onshore oil field, the Jackson oil field. This field was discovered in 1981. Pipelines transport gas to the major markets of Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney. Overall about 1,800 petroleum wells have been drilled. The largest producer in the basin is Santos with its main production facility at Moomba, South Australia at the head of the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System. The oil and gas deposits in the Cooper Basin tend to be fairly small and fragmentary, but highly economical given the relatively low cost of drilling and completion. Overall there are 160 gas fields and 75 oil fields in production containing about 630 producing gas wells and more than 340 producing oil wells. There are many small listed companies exploring for additional deposits in the region. Some of these companies are Austin Exploration, Cooper Energy, Beach Energy, Senex Energy, Bridgeport Energy, Strike Energy, Bengal Energy, Acer Energy, Magellan, Impress Energy, Red Sky Energy and many others.  Geothermal  Within the basin, exploration companies have conducted extensive research to discover if the area is appropriate for large-scale production. They have drilled and measured the temperature in many holes, estimating that hot granite rocks at 3.5 km deep are 240 C. The Cooper Basin has been selected for the site of a geothermal project, because these rocks are the hottest in the world at economic drilling depths and away from volcanoes. During reservoir stimulation in 2003, induced seismic events up to magnitude 3.7 were observed.  Impact crater  The Basin hides an impact crater created around 300 million years ago. Its discovery by scientist Tonguç Uysal was revealed in October 2010. The craters minimum diameter is 80 km, making it one of the largest of Australias 30 to 50 known or suspected craters.

    "text": "The 189697 season was the 16th season of competitive association football and 5th season in the Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. In 189596, Small Heath finished in 15th position in the 16-team First Division and were relegated via the test match system. In 189697, they finished 4th in the Second Division. Small Heath entered the 189697 FA Cup at the first round round of 32 and lost in that round for the fifth consecutive year, this time to Notts County. In local competitions, they were eliminated in the semi-final of the Birmingham Senior Cup and the first round of the Staffordshire Senior Cup, on each occasion beaten by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Twenty-three different players represented the club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were 12 different goalscorers. Alex Leake appeared in every match, and the top scorer was Jimmy Inglis with 16 goals. The highest attendance was around 7,500, significantly down on the previous season.  Background  The Nottinghamshire Guardian suggested Small Heath would have to greatly improve their present team if they are to make a very prominent display even in the second division next season. Billy Ollis, last seasons captain, moved on to Hereford Thistle of the Birmingham  District League, Jack Oliver returned to non-League football in his native north-east, Harry Haynes joined Southern League club Southampton St Marys, Ted Devey left for Burton Wanderers, and Adam Fraser returned to Scotland, but the major loss was that of Fred Wheldon. Wheldon scored 116 goals from 175 matches in league and FA Cup for Small Heath, and the only match he missed in six seasons was when his sister died on the morning of the game. He joined League champions Aston Villa for a fee which, after much speculation, was confirmed at Small Heaths Annual General Meeting as 350 guaranteed, plus the proceeds of a match to be played between the two clubs. The 350 fee was reported to be a transfer record.  Review   SeptemberOctober  Small Heath prepared for the new season with a friendly match at Aston Villa in connection with Fred Wheldons transfer. Wheldon scored twice as Villa won 31, Small Heaths goal coming from Walter Abbott. Because the kickoff was delayed until six oclock, the match ended in near darkness. The League season began with a spirited performance at home to Newcastle United on a rain-soaked pitch. First-half goals from Alex Leake, Jimmy Inglis with a header from Tom Farnalls free kick, and Jack Jones gave Small Heath a 31 victory, prompting the press to predict a finish in the test match positions. In the return fixture, Newcastle led 32 at half time  three goals for Richard Smellie against Joness two  but were reduced to ten men, William Graham having broken his arm. Inglis tied the scores in the second half but the home team scored a late winner. Two days later, Small Heath enjoyed a comfortable home win against Darwen in an early-evening match. Inglis opened the scoring with a header, then in the second half, a disputed goal was allowed, and a fine shot from Billy Walton and two goals from William Robertson made the final score 51. In a poor game, Small Heath suffered an unexpected defeat at home to Lincoln City. The Leicester Chronicle suggested that if the Heathens have any pretentions towards regaining their position in the First Division, as we believe is their ambition, they will have to show form vastly different from last Saturday. An Inglis header gave his team a first-half lead on a slippery surface at Burton Swifts, and both sides wasted chances before Swifts equalised with ten minutes left. A 21 defeat at home to Burton Swifts preceded a visit to league leaders Newton Heath and reunion with former captain Caesar Jenkyns. The home side had the better of the first half, in torrential rain following a thunderstorm just before kickoff, but the closest they came to scoring was when Smith hit the bar. In the second half, Newton Heath scored from a scrimmage, but Jones equalised for Small Heath after the forwards rushed downfield. Playing with the benefit of the slope, Walsall took the lead twice in the Staffordshire Cup, but on change of ends, Small Heath equalised, and scored twice more in extra time to progress to the next round. In mid-October, former England international forward Dennis Hodgetts joined from Aston Villa. The Dundee Courier  Argus assessed the player thus:Aston Villa have so many clever forwards that they afford to dispense with a man like Hodgetts, who is now naturally slow, and disinclined to work. But his judgment and coaching powers should render him a useful recruit for the other Birmingham club ... Hodgetts is the one historic forward England has produced. As an inside left it is doubtful if he ever had an equal; certainly he never had a superior. He was one of the most artistic dribblers and dodgers ever seen,",

    "text": "Hunger is a 2023 Thai psychological drama film directed by Sitisiri Mongkolsiri and written by Kongdej Jaturanrasamee. It stars Chutimon Chuengcharoensukying as Aoy, a street-food cook who is invited to join the fine-dining industry under the tutelage of the infamous Chef Paul, played by Nopachai Jayanama, with Gunn Svasti as Tone, a supportive sous chef. The film was announced by Netflix in 2022 as one of its six upcoming Thai original productions, and was released on the platform in April 2023. The film received mostly positive reviews.  Plot  Aoy is the main cook at her familys street restaurant. She is scouted by Tone, the junior sous-chef of Hunger, an haute cuisine catering restaurant run by the celebrity Chef Paul. Dissatisfied with the direction of her life since finishing high school, Aoy accepts the invitation and auditions alongside a culinary school graduate. Paul has the applicants cook fried rice, and hires Aoy for her deeper understanding of culinary technique and her skill with the wok. In preparation for a private birthday party hosted by a retired general, Paul demands that Aoy slice and fry wagyu beef to exacting specifications. After many failed attempts, she walks out in frustration but returns and practices frying the meat all night until Paul finally approves. At the party, Aoy fries the meat in front of the guests, who include entrepreneur Tos, a business rival of Paul. As Aoy continues working with the relentless Paul, she faces the limits of her skills and studies more cooking techniques from Tone. Hungers soup specialist Tue is fired for stealing ingredients, forcing sous-chef Dang to pick up the slack for Hungers next client, a family of three. When Paul tries the soup, he tosses it out and remakes it using cheap ingredients on hand, later explaining that he tasted shrimp in the original soup even though he warned his chefs that the clients young daughter had a shellfish allergy. Paul deduces Dang sabotaged the soup due to his jealousy over Hungers younger chefs surpassing him. Dang stabs Paul with a knife and storms out. Aoy visits the hospitalized Paul, who opens up about the reason he became a chef. His mother was a maid for an extravagantly rich family, and she was forced to make restitution when he broke a jar of caviar. The incident made Paul realize that the rich view food as a status symbol and take flavor and nourishment for granted, and he resolved to become a chef of such renown that rich people would debase themselves to have him cook for them. Aoy is distraught by her father suffering a health crisis, as well as learning that Hungers previous client was a construction executive heavily in debt who killed his wife, daughter, and himself after they ate their meal. After Paul leads Hunger to serve a government official in an illegal hunt and cooking of a protected great hornbill from a national park, Aoy and Tone quit. Aoy is hired as the head chef at Toss new restaurant Flame and grows famous, while Tones restaurant struggles. A celebrity named Milky hires both Aoy and Paul to cook for her birthday party, which turns into an impromptu competition as the two chefs vie for the guests adulation. In the end, Paul wins by serving an ordinary soup, and he explains to Aoy that he won not because his food or presentation were superior to hers, but because his reputation made the guests desire anything served by him more. Pauls gloating is interrupted when Tone leaks a video of Paul cooking the hornbill and the chef is arrested. Tos admits that he and Tone conspired to use the party to destroy Paul and elevate Aoy; furthermore, the celebrity client picked Paul for her party first and only hired Aoy because of Toss lobbying. Disillusioned, Aoy quits Flame. She is welcomed home by her family and resumes cooking at their restaurant.  Cast  Nopachai Chaiyanam as Chef Paul Chimwemwe Miller as Paul voice Chutimon Chuengcharoensukying as Aoy Gunn Svasti Na Ayudhya as Tone Alex Gravenstein as Tone voice Majid Sajadi as Food Taster Bhumibhat Thavornsiri as Au Kenneth Won as Party Guest Varit Leesavan as Tos Lalita Paisarn as Milky  Reception  The film received mostly positive reviews, with an 86 rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The Bangkok Posts reviewer Tatat Bunnag criticized the screenplay and dialogue, but concluded that despite all the flaws, Hunger is still worth watching, especially for those who love intense drama and exotic settings.

    "text": "Dame Barbara Evelyn Clayton 2 September 1922  11 January 2011 was an English pathologist who made a significant contribution to clinical medicine, medical research and public service. She delivered what was depending on your point of view either a flawed verdict or deliberate cover-up that nothing but hysteria was to blame for the Camelford Water Pollution Incident captured in the BBC documentary Poison Water. Dame Barbara was latterly Professor of Clinical Pathology at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.  Biography  Clayton was born in Liverpool on 2 September 1922 to Constance Evelyn née Caine and William Clayton, a food scientist who is credited with inventing salad cream. She was educated at St Nicholas Preparatory School in Orpington and Bromley County School for Girls, where she was head girl. She went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, qualifying in 1946. Her interest in research took her to the Medical Research Council clinical endocrinology unit in Edinburgh. In 1949 she received a PhD for her research into oestrogens in 1949. Later that year she moved to London to become the Holden research fellow at St Thomass Hospital Medical School, a position she held until 1956 when she became a chemical pathology lecturer at the School. Her research on hormones and the development of new biochemical techniques brought her recognition. In 1959, she moved to Great Ormond Street Hospital to become a consultant pathologist. There she researched genetic metabolic disorders suffered by newborn babies. She developed a new, less invasive test to diagnose phenylketonuria  the test and the special diet that Claydon also designed continue to be in common use today. She worked with dieticians to optimize diets for infants with phenylketonuria and other metabolic disorders. Over her career, Clayton published more than 200 academic papers. Concerned with the high levels of lead found in childrens blood she co-authored, with five others, the article Lead poisoning in children Arch dis child 1964, 39, 113 and while a member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in the 1980s, campaigned and lobbied the UK government to enforce a ban on lead in petrol, paint and other products. Her work showed a relationship between lead poisoning and intellectual impairment. In 1978 she became the University of Southamptons first female professor when she took up the position of Professor of Chemical Pathology and Human Metabolism. She was Dean of Medicine at the university from 1983 to 1986, and honorary consultant chemical pathologist at the Southampton General Hospital. In 1987 she was appointed Honorary Research Professor in Metabolism and researched the nutritional needs of the elderly, particularly those in care homes. She served on the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution from 1981 to 1996 and chaired the enquiry into the Camelford water pollution incident in 1988. She concluded that the symptoms locals experienced after the Camelford incident were caused by anxiety due to media coverage.

    "text": "Yves Manglou born 20 August 1943 is a Réunionese writer who writes in both French and Réunion Creole.  Biography  Yves Manglou grew up on the French island of Réunion at a time when traditional storytelling was still very popular. Réunion was still a French colony and the abolition of slavery had occurred less than a century before. Brought up as one of nine children under the watchful eye of his school teacher father and stay-at-home mother, Manglou enjoyed much freedom exploring the banks of the Saint-Jean river, often going barefoot and shirtless. From the end of 1960 to 1975, Manglou successively held the position of Director of Social  Cultural Institutions in Sainte-Suzanne, Soisy-sous-Montmorency and Boulogne-Billancourt. In 1971 he devoted a year of advanced study at the French National Institute of Popular Education at Marly-le-Roi to the study of the development of inter-disciplinary scholarship in rural areas. Manglous study culminated Animation and Development, a dissertation that was written in collaboration with Jean Schüler and is considered authoritative in the field. In 19741975, as Director of the Youth Center of Boulogne-Billancourt, Manglou began to coordinate various volunteer organizations in a city of 120,000. The exhibition Associations in the City, unique for its time, received 10,000 visitors. During this same period Manglou also obtained a maîtrise in Human Sciences at the University of Paris, Val-de-Marne  a foreshadowing of experienced-based learning, which was later formalized in France as Validation des Acquis de lExperience. These various sociological approaches and a thirst for getting to know people and their cultures naturally led Yves Manglou to make his native island the focus of his literary journey.

    "text": "Glen Croe Scottish Gaelic: Gleann a Chrò is a glen in the heart of the Arrochar Alps in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The glen is surrounded by large and rugged mountains characterised by huge boulders. The Croe Water flows through the glen and into Loch Long.  Geography  Glen Croe is located to the north west of Loch Lomond and Loch Long, draining into the latter. At the head of the glen is the pass leading to Glen Kinglas. The A83 road runs the length of the glen, passing the viewpoint at Rest  Be Thankful, at the west of the Glen. Glen Croe is situated entirely within the Argyll Forest Park in Cowal. The glen is also within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. The mountains on either side are: Beinn Ìme Munro at 1,011 metres 3,317 ft Ben Donich Corbett at 847 metres 2,779 ft Beinn Luibhean Corbett at 857 metres 2,812 ft The Brack Corbett at 787 metres 2,582 ft Beinn an Lochain Corbett at 703 metres 2,306 ft The Cobbler Corbett at 870 metres 2,850 ft  Landslides  The glen was formed by glacial erosion and has repercussions today, as many areas are still unstable. The A83 is prone to landslides, including the section within Glen Croe. The A83 is a main road to the west coast of Scotland. On 8 October 2023, ten people were airlifted off the road by helicopter, as they were trapped by seven separate landslides along a short section of the road. When the A83 is closed, traffic is diverted onto the single track military road that runs in the bottom of the glen, till the steep incline at the head of the glen called Rest  be Thankful.  History  The old road through the glen seen in the photograph very top of article is part of the military road that ran from Dumbarton to Inveraray. The old road was built in the 1740s under the supervision of Major William Caulfeild. A stone inscribed Rest  Be Thankful was erected around 1749, after this section of road was completed. The rest and be thankful refers to a steep incline on the old military road, that precedes, entering the pass through too Glen Kinglas.  Rest and Be Thankful Speed Hill Climb  From 1906 until 1970, motor racing events, including hill climbs and rally stages took place here.  Song  Gilleasbaig Mac an t-Saoir composed a song called Òran Ghlinne Chrò, detailing the sadness he felt when the gamekeeper moved his flock out of the glen to make room for deer and sport hunting.

    "text": "In mathematics, a CliffordKlein form is a double coset space ΓGH, where G is a reductive Lie group, H a closed subgroup of G, and Γ a discrete subgroup of G that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space GH. A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given G and H. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether ΓGH can be taken to be a compact space, called a compact CliffordKlein form. When H is itself compact, classical results show that a compact CliffordKlein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.  History  According to Moritz Epple, the Clifford-Klein forms began when W. K. Clifford used quaternions to twist their space. Every twist possessed a space-filling family of invariant lines, the Clifford parallels. They formed a particular structure embedded in elliptic 3-space, the Clifford surface, which demonstrated that the same local geometry may be tied to spaces that are globally different. Wilhelm Killing thought that for free mobility of rigid bodies there are four spaces: Euclidean, hyperbolic, elliptic and spherical. They are spaces of constant curvature but constant curvature differs from free mobility: it is local, the other is both local and global. Killings contribution to Clifford-Klein space forms involved formulation in terms of groups, finding new classes of examples, and consideration of the scientific relevance of spaces of constant curvature. He took up the task to develop physical theories of CK space forms. Karl Schwarzchild wrote The admissible measure of the curvature of space, and noted in an appendix that physical space may actually be a non-standard space of constant curvature.

    "text": "The spur-winged goose Plectropterus gambensis is a large, Sub-Saharan African waterbird in the family Anatidae, which includes geese and shelducks. However, P. gambensis developed unique environmental adaptations, which resulted in the evolution of several anatomical features that are not shared with other anatids; thus, the species has been classified one step further into its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.  Description  Adults are 75115 cm 3045 in long, and weigh an average of 46.8 kg 8.815.0 lb rarely up to 10 kg 22 lb, with ganders males being noticeably larger than the geese. The wingspan can range from 150 to 200 cm 59 to 79 in. One source claims the average weight of males is around 6 kg 13 lb and the weight of females is around 4.7 kg 10 lb. However, 11 individuals that were banded in South Africa, were found to average only 3.87 kg 8.5 lb, with a range of 2.4 to 5.4 kg 5.3 to 11.9 lb. Another South African-based study found 58 males weighing an average of 5.52 kg 12.2 lb and measuring 98.1 cm 38.6 in in total length; meanwhile, 34 females averaged 3.35 kg 7.4 lb in weight and 84.2 cm 33.1 in in total length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 42.5 to 55 cm 16.7 to 21.7 in, the bill is 5.7 to 6.4 cm 2.2 to 2.5 in and the tarsus is 5.7 to 12 cm 2.2 to 4.7 in. They are among the largest true African waterfowl besides the wading Goliath heron and are, on average, the worlds largest goose, although in average weight, their size is at least rivaled by the Cape Barren goose. Spur-winged geese appear to be more closely allied to shelducks than true geese such as those from the Branta and Anser genera. They are mainly black, with a white face and large white wing patches. The long legs are pinkish red in colour. The male differs from the female, not only in size, but also in having a larger red facial patch extending back from the red bill, and a knob at the base of the upper mandible. This is generally a quiet species. Typically, only males make a call, which consists of a soft bubbling cherwit when taking wing or alarmed. During breeding displays or in instances of alarm, both sexes may utter other inconspicuous calls.  Toxicity  Some populations of the spur-winged goose are toxic. Populations that have a diet that includes significant quantities of blister beetles are poisonous. The poison, cantharidin, is held within the tissue of the bird resulting in poisoning of those that eat the cooked goose. A dose of 10 mg of cantharidin can kill a human.  Habitat  This species often occurs in open grasslands with lakes, seasonal pools, rivers, swamps and river deltas. Large inland rivers and lakes are perhaps most commonly inhabited, with saline lakes and upland areas generally being avoided, although the species can occur to an elevation of 3,000 m 9,800 ft in eastern Africa. It is also absent from arid zones.  Ecology  The spur-winged goose is gregarious, generally meeting in small flocks that contain up to 50 birds. They occur around various African rivers, lakes and swamps. Varied sites may be used for post-breeding moulting, in which case large numbers of the geese may congregate. This common species feeds by grazing, but spends the middle part of the day resting by water. Its diet consists predominantly of plant matter such as the vegetative parts and seeds of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants, agricultural grains, fruit e.g. figs and tuberous crops, although it may occasionally supplement its diet with small fish or insects. Dispersal may occur in pursuit of feeding opportunities outside of the breeding season. The breeding season for spur-winged geese is variable across the range. In the north, breeding generally occurs from August to December, in eastern Africa from January to June and in southern Africa from August to May. This species is highly aggressive to other waterfowl including conspecifics during the breeding season. At this time of the year, the geese may violently put the spur on the bend of the wings to use in conflicts with other birds. Adult male geese are especially prone to attacking other adult males. The large nest is usually concealed in vegetation near water, but tree holes, cavities in rocks, old hamerkop, African fish eagle or social weaver nests and even the top of a termite mound and an aardvark burrow have been used as nests. When choosing a tree-nest site, they will generally select a nest located close to the ground at between 20 and 100 cm 7.9 and 39.4 in high in trees 3 to 4 m 9.8 to 13.1 ft high. Generally, they prefer quiet, undisturbed stretches of riverbank and wetlands for nest sites.  Status  The spur-winged goose is a common bird of African wetlands. Perhaps the main threat to the species is development and destruction of wetland habitats and unregulated hunting.

    "text": "Hazelwood School is a private preparatory school in Limpsfield, Surrey, England. The school was established in 1890 as a boarding school for boys aged 813 by Ruth and Edward Baily. Baily bought the land from the Titsey Place estate as he loved the views of the Weald and the Ashdown Forest and thought the site healthy and bracing. The first cohort of 38 pupils was accommodated and taught in a purpose-built Victorian building that remains at the centre of the school today. In 1962 the school was bought by Tim Dowling and merged with his Bickley Hall School in Bromley, Kentresulting in the double motto and double badge known today. Hazelwood School became a registered charity and was incorporated as a limited company in 1968. Girls were first admitted to the school and a pre-prep department established in 1978. Boarding continued at the school until 1999.  History   18801906  Edward Baily founded Hazelwood School as an educational boarding establishment for boys in 1880. The first site for the school was in Balsham, Cambridgeshire, with just two boys. In 1884, with a dozen more boys, the school moved to Warlingham in Surrey before finally settling on our current site in Limpsfield, Surrey, in 1890 with 38 pupils. Following Mr Bailys retirement in 1906, Mr Lifton-Wynne, who had worked at the school many years, took over the management of the school. This period in the schools history was overshadowed by war and, less seriously, recurring attacks of influenza. In the post-war period, Mr Hugh Crauford Irving took over as headmaster. He established the house system with two houses named after old boys who had served during the First World War: Cather and Hansen. The fabric of the schools buildings remained much the same during this period, although regular improvements were made to the chapel.  1930s and 1940s  Mr Parry took over as headmaster in 1938, on the eve of the Second World War. During the war, the site was bombed, which resulted in the loss of the original Victorian pavilion and fives courts. These were rebuilt in the late 1940s along with the Oak and Chestnut cottages, which needed to house the growing number of boys and staff. Chestnut was used as married quarters for staff and accommodation for senior boys. Oak cottage housed three masters, matron and more dormitories for senior boys. In 1949, a new changing room was also added to the site. By the end of the 1940s, there were in the region of 70 boarders so another house was added to the house system: Blacker-Douglass, named after another old boy who served in the First World War.  1950s and 1960s  Throughout the 1950s, there were 70 boys boarding at Hazelwood. Despite the healthy numbers on roll, post-war austerity and rebuilding, necessitated by wartime bombing, meant that the school fell on hard times. In 1962, Godfrey R V Tim Dowling born 1917 bought the school and merged with his own school, Bickley Hall, Bromley. The school mottoes also merged, resulting in the double badge emblem. The school remained privately owned by Mr Dowling until 1968 when it became a registered charity and was incorporated as a limited company. The newly formed board of trustees  governors bought the freehold from the Dowlings. Mr Dowling remained as head until his retirement in 1974.  1970s  In 1972, Mr Dowling oversaw the completion of a series of new buildings to the site. A multi-purpose hall replaced the 1940s cricket pavilion and fives court. This was used as a gymnasium, dining hall, music room and kitchen space, with three classrooms, library and staff room upstairs. More classrooms were built in front and to the side of the main Victorian building. In the late 1970s, new headmaster Mr Bawtree had Chestnut cottage adapted for use as a pre-preparatory school for children aged 57 years. Oak cottage continued to be used staff accommodation and all boarders were moved to the main Victorian building. In 1979, two lower tennis courts were added. With a new pre-prep and the admittance of girls, the number of pupils on roll rose considerably during this period. A new house system was established in 1976: the four houses were named after past Hazelwood headmasters: Baily, Irving, Parry and Dowling.  1980s  Mr Bawtree continued his development of the site into the 1980s with a new indoor swimming pool to replace the outdoor swimming bath in front of Oak cottage. He also added a new Creative Arts Centre. In 1987, a violent storm caused the lavish Victorian chapel to be destroyed so plans were put in place for its replacement.  1990s  In 1990, the new chapel was opened. The new chapel formed part of a performing arts block, which housed the music department and a theatre. Mr Bawtree retired in 1995 and was succeeded by Mr Synge. In 1996, Mr Synge opened the new purpose-built Chestnut building to house the increasing number of pre-prep children attending the school. This gave them thei",

As of 2025, Angolan citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 47 countries and territories, ranking the Angolan passport 91st in terms of travel freedom tied with passports from Jordan, Mauritania and Mali according to the Henley Passport Index.  Visa requirements map   Visa requirements   Dependent, Disputed, or Restricted territories  Unrecognized or partially recognized countries Dependent and autonomous territories  Non-visa restrictions  Many countries have entry restrictions on foreigners that go beyond the common requirement of having either a valid visa or a visa exemption. Such restrictions may be health related or impose additional documentation requirements on certain classes of people for diplomatic or political purposes.  Blank passport pages  Many countries require a minimum number of blank pages to be available in the passport being presented, typically one or two pages. Endorsement pages, which often appear after the visa pages, are not counted as being valid or available.  Vaccination  The African countries of Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Côte dIvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia, require all incoming passengers older than nine months to one year to have a current International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, as does the South American territory of French Guiana. Some other countries require vaccination only if the passenger is coming from an infected area or has visited one recently or has transited for 12 hours in those countries: Algeria, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Passport validity length  Very few countries, such as Paraguay, just require a valid passport on arrival. However many countries and groupings now require only an identity card  especially from their neighbours. Other countries may have special bilateral arrangements that depart from the generality of their passport validity length policies to shorten the period of passport validity required for each others citizens or even accept passports that have already expired but not been cancelled. Some countries, such as Japan, Ireland and the United Kingdom, require a passport valid throughout the period of the intended stay. In the absence of specific bilateral agreements, countries requiring passports to be valid for at least 6 more months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Anguilla, Bahrain, Bhutan, Botswana, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Costa Rica, Côte dIvoire, Curaçao, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Countries requiring passports valid for at least 4 months on arrival include Micronesia and Zambia. Countries requiring passports with a validity of at least 3 months beyond the date of intended departure include Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Honduras, Montenegro, Nauru, Moldova and New Zealand. Similarly, the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, all European Union countries except Ireland together with Switzerland also require 3 months validity beyond the date of the bearers intended departure unless the bearer is an EEA or Swiss national.

    "text": "12696 Camus, provisional designation 1989 SF1, is a carbonaceous background asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 26 September 1989, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at ESOs La Silla Observatory in northern Chile, and named after French Nobel Prize laureate in literature Albert Camus.  Classification and orbit  Camus is a non-family asteroid from the main belts background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.23.0 AU once every 4 years and 3 months 1,551 days. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 8 with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroids observation arc begins with its discovery, as no precoveries were taken and no identifications were made before 1989.  Naming  This minor planet was named after French philosopher, author, and journalist, Albert Camus 19131960, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957. Camus is best known for his novels LEtranger The Stranger and La Peste The Plague. His main interests were justice, ethics, and politics. As a liberal humanist, he was against the doctrines of Christianity as well as Marxism. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 March 2000 M.P.C. 39658.  Physical characteristics  Camus has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey.  Lightcurves  In October 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Camus was obtained from photometric observations by Julian Oey at the Leura Observatory E17 in Australia. The lightcurve rendered a rotation period of 3.780.04 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.40 in magnitude U3-.  Diameter and albedo  According to NASAs Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Camus has an albedo of 0.07 and 0.13 with a corresponding diameter of 9.3 and 7.7 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a larger diameter of 11.1 kilometer with an absolute magnitude of 13.5.

    "text": "The St. Petersburgische Zeitung from 1852: St. Petersburger Zeitung Saint Petersburg Newspaper was a German language newspaper in Saint Petersburg, published between 1727 and 1915 in the Russian Empire.  History  The Sankt Petersburgische Zeitung was the first foreign German language newspaper as well as the second oldest newspaper in Russia. It was started at almost the same time as the first Russian newspaper in 1729. Initially it was a weekly newspaper, and starting in 1831, it was published daily. Until 1874 it was owned by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and thereafter it was transferred to the Ministry for National Education. Under the editorship of Hofrat de:Clemens Friedrich Meyer 18521874 the paper received a modern appearance. In 1878 it was rented out to the Baltic German journalist de:Konstantin Paul Gerhard von Kügelgen 18431904, who combined it with the Nordische Presse Northern Press. The newspaper then became the leading informational newspaper de:Intelligenzblatt of the Baltic region. After his death, his children de:Paul von Kügelgen 18751952 and de:Karl Konrad Emil von Kügelgen 18761945 continued to run the newspaper. At the end of 1914, the St. Petersburger Zeitung ceased publication due to the First World War. The de:Sankt Petersburger Herold Saint Petersburg Herald was among its main competition in the late 19th century.  Bibliography  Carola L.

    "text": "José Leandro de Souza Ferreira born 17 March 1959, known as Leandro, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a defender. He played for Flamengo during his whole professional career, first as a right-sided full-back and, from 1983 on, as a central defender. He also played for the Brazil national team in the 1980s, including at the 1982 FIFA World Cup.  Club career  Leandro spent his entire club career Flamengo, where he won four Brazilian national leagues, five Rio State championships, one Libertadores da América, and one Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool. In total, he played 417 matches and scored 14 goals for Flamengo.  International career  Leandro was capped 27 times for Brazil between September 1981 and May 1986, scoring two goals. He took part at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was part of a star-studded Brazilian team, along with Zico, Júnior, Falcão, Sócrates, and many others, including Éder and Toninho Cerezo. Despite the plethora of creative midfield talent in the team, and the exciting brand of attacking football that they displayed throughout the tournament, Brazil were eliminated in the second round, after placing second in the so-called Group of Death with rivals and defending champions Argentina, as well as the eventual champions Italy. Leandro also took part at the 1983 Copa América, where Brazil finished in second place. A principled man, he refused to go to 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, however, after a disagreement with the coach Telê Santana over the exclusion of his teammate Renato from the squad.  After retirement  Leandro prematurely retired in 1990 at 31 years of age. He currently owns and manages a restaurant and hotel in his hometown Cabo Frio.  Style of play  Considered one of the greatest Brazilian defenders of all-time, Leandro started his career as an offensive-minded right-sided full-back or wing-back. In this role, he was capable of delivering decisive crosses to the forwards, or indeed taking a shot at goal himself. He also had an ability to dribble past opposing players and get forward. Leandro was also able to cover the flank both offensively and defensively: he could often be found in the outside right position, yet would get back to defence when needed. After several knee injuries and some surgeries in 1985, Leandro started to play as a centre-back, also achieving much success in this role, and was still called up to the Brazil national squad to play in this new position.

    "text": "Frederick Joseph Ross May 12, 1927  August 19, 2014 LL. D. was a New Brunswick based Canadian artist best known for his figurative drawings, paintings and murals.  Early life  Ross was born in on May 12, 1927 in Saint John, New Brunswick, to parents Ernest L. Ross and Elizabeth Drake. He studied art at the Saint John Vocational School. Ross received a bachelor of fine arts from Mount Allison University and a bachelor of education from the University of New Brunswick. Ross went on to create a number of notable murals in the Maritimes, including one in Fredericton and on Prince Edward Island . He returned to teach at Saint John Vocational School from the 1950s until 1970, becoming the head of its art department. He married Sheila Urquhart in 1954.  Career  In 1946, Ross began work on a commissioned mural work that would become The Destruction of War  Rebuilding the World through Education, a memorial mural to 63 students of Fredericton High School who had died in World War II. After its unveiling in 1948, the mural was later dismantled and lost in the 1950s. It was recreated by Ross and several apprentices in 2011, in a plan developed by the artist William Forrestall and based on the original 1948 full scale cartoons preparatory drawings Ross had mistakenly left at the New Brunswick Museum. The chance discovery of the full-scale mural drawings, now housed at the National Gallery of Canada, provided what would eventually become a treasure map-like route to the murals restoration. With what grew to be nationwide support, three studio assistants, who were guided by Fred Ross and the drawings that he had created more than 60 years earlier, retraced the developmental process of the mural in what would prove to be the most ambitious reanimation of a cultural treasure in Canadian art history. This unprecedented story of the murals history  its creation, loss, and eventual restoration and return to public prominence is documented in the text Redeemed: Restoring the Lost Fred Ross Mural, written and edited by William Forrestall, and published by the University of New Brunswick. In 1967, Ross work was shown at Expo 67 in Montreal. The Beaverbrook Art Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of his work titled The Art of Fred Ross - A Timeless Humanism curated by Tom Smart in 1993. Ross work is held in the National Gallery of Canada, the New Brunswick Museum, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and other collections.  Awards  Ross received the Order of Canada in 2004. He was awarded with an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of New Brunswick in 1984 and the Order of New Brunswick in 2008.  References",

Overview  Indians as migrant workers first began to arrive in modern-day Saudi Arabia in relatively small numbers from the British Raj soon after the discovery of oil in 1938, but their migration numbers skyrocketed exponentially after the 1973 energy crisis and subsequent oil boom. However, migration to Saudi Arabia dropped dramatically after reaching its peak in 2014 due to the introduction of the Nitaqat scheme in 2011, the acceleration of the 2010s oil glut by early 2016, and the launch of Saudi Vision 2030.  History  India and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement to manage and organize the recruitment of domestic workers in January 2014. Between then and April 2016, 500,000 Indians moved to Saudi Arabia for employment. The agreement includes a provision which stipulates that sponsors must pay a guarantee of US2,500 for each Indian worker they recruit.

He was a native of Saint Kitts, and was a journalist and politician before being appointed governor.  Early life  Allen was born in Palmetto Point, Saint Kitts. The son of a stonemason, he served an apprenticeship to a tailor in Basseterre before deciding to emigrate to the United States. Settling in New York City, he became a leader of the West Indian community there, and organised financial support for the newly formed Saint Kitts Workers League a forerunner of the current Labour Party. After more than 25 years as a resident of the United States, Allen returned to Saint Kitts in 1935, becoming known as an editor of various labour movement publications.  Politics  Allen was appointed to the Legislative Council of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla in 1958, but resigned in 1962 to allow Robert Bradshaw, a minister in the West Indies Federation, to resume his position after the federations dissolution. He returned to the council shortly after, and served for a period as a minister without portfolio before eventually being elected speaker. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire OBE in June 1964, for his parliamentary service.  Governorship and later life  In 1969, following the resignation of Sir Fred Phillips, Allen was appointed acting governor of the Islands. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1972 New Year Honours, and later in the year received a permanent appointment as governor, becoming the first native of Saint Kitts to serve in the position. Allen continued to serve as governor until early 1975, when he retired and was replaced by Probyn Inniss. He died in September 1981, aged 93.  References",

    "text": "Gabriel Téllez, O. de M. 24 March 1583  20 February 1648, also known as Tirso de Molina, was a Spanish Baroque dramatist and poet, as well as a Mercedarian friar, and Catholic priest. He is primarily known for writing The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest, the play from which the character Don Juan originates. His work also includes female protagonists and the exploration of sexual issues.  Life and career  Gabriel Téllez was born in Madrid to Andrés López and Juana Téllez, servants of the Count of Molina. As a youth, he studied at the University of Alcalá. He joined the mendicant Order of Our Lady of Mercy on 4 November 1600, by whom he was sent to the Monastery of San Antolín at Guadalajara to begin his period of novitiate on 21 January 1601. He had been ordained as a priest by 1610. Téllez had been writing plays for ten years when he was sent by his superiors on a mission to the West Indies in 1615; as a result, he resided in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo from 1616 to 1618. After returning to Europe, he resided at the Mercedarian monastery in Madrid, where he took part in the proceedings of the Medrano Academy, competed in the literary tournaments, and wrote for the stage. Tellez first publication, the incomplete Cigarrales de Toledo a work licensed in 1621, but not published until 1624, is a miscellany of short tales, novellas, verses, and three plays. One of the novellas, Los tres maridos burlados, which may have been derived from Francesco Cieco da Ferraras Mambriano, and the play entitled El vergonzoso en palacio are considered to demonstrate wit and ingenuity. The preface to Cigarrales de Toledo states that Tirso de Molina had already written three hundred plays. Téllez opposed culteranismo in the Cigarrales de Toledo, and made enemies through his attacks on it in pieces such as Amar por arte mayor and La celosa de si misma. The tone of some of his productions caused his rivals to denounce him as a corrupter of public morals to the Council of Castile in 1625, and, though no legal action was taken against him, he may have been reprimanded privately. In 1626, it was thought to be advisable to transfer him to Salamanca, thus Téllez left Madrid, determined not to write anything more for the stage. Although one of his plays, La huerta de San Juan, is dated as being written in 1626, there is no proof that he started writing it after his departure from Madrid, and it is suspected that he did not write anything for eight years. Téllez, however, had not lost his interest in theatre, having published twelve representative pieces as the first part of his dramatic works 1626. At the same time, he continued to serve his Order, being named the prior of the monastery at Trujillo in 1626; he was elected later to the posts of reader in theology and Definitor General, and, in May 1632, he was appointed the official archivist of the Order. His Deleitar aprovechando, which was published in 1635, is a counterpart of the Cigarrales de Toledo. A sequel was promised to this collection of tales, lyrics, and autos, but, as in the case of the Cigarrales de Toledo, the continuation never appeared. Twelve plays constitute the third part of his dramatic works published in 1634; the plays were supposedly edited by the writers nephew, Francisco Lucas de Ávila; however, Ávila may have been a cover identity for himself. The second section of the plays 1635, the printing of which was paid for by the Confraternity of St. Jerome, contains four plays by Téllez, and eight written by him in collaboration with other dramatists, including Juan Ruiz de Alarcón; however, Tirso de Molina still did the majority of the writing. The fourth and fifth compilations of his dramatic works 1635 and 1636 each contain twelve plays; the haste with which these five volumes were issued may indicate the authors desire to save some part of his work from destruction, and the appearance of his nephews name on the titlepages of the last four volumes may indicate his desire to avoid conflict with the authorities. A sixth volume of dramatic pieces, consisting of comedies, was announced; however, the project was abandoned. Dramatic composition may have still been a part of Tirsos leisure as he grew older, as indicated by how the fragmentary autograph copy of Las quinas de Portugal is dated 8 March 1638, despite the fact that his active career as a dramatist ended two years earlier. He was absorbed by other duties. As official archivist of his order, he compiled the elaborate Historia de la Merced his religious order, which occupied him until 24 December 1639, and which was not published until 1973. As a tribute to the Count de Sastago, who had accepted the dedication of the fourth part of the plays, and who may have helped to defray the publishing expenses, Tirso de Molina is said to have compiled the Genealogía de la casa de Sastago 1640, but the ascription of this genealogical work is disputed. On 29 September 1645, Tirso d",

    "text": "Ntlhoi Motsamai born 1963 is a Lesotho politician who served as the first female Speaker of the National Assembly from 1999 to 2012. She was elected again from March 2015 to June 2017. Motsamai worked as a teacher before entering politics.  Early life  Motsamai was born in the remote village of Ha Pafoli, in the Mohales Hoek District. She attended Eagles Peak High School and then went on to study at the National University of Lesotho, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Education B.Sc.Ed. degree and majoring in biology and chemistry. After her graduation, Motsamai began teaching at St. Johns High School in Mafeteng. She later returned to the National University to complete a Master of Education M.Ed. degree, simultaneously working in the office of the dean.  Politics   19962012  Motsamai entered politics in 1996, when she was elected deputy speaker of the National Assembly. Lesothos constitution does not restrict the speakership or the deputy speakership to members of parliament, only requiring that ministers cannot be elected to those positions. Motsamai succeeded to the speakership in 1999, following the death of John Teboho Kolane. She became Lesothos first female speaker, and was also believed to be the youngest speaker in Africa. When she took office, the National Assembly had only three female MPs. In 2005, Motsamai nominated Bereng Sekhonyana to represent Lesotho at a SADC parliamentary reform conference in Botswana. Justin Lekhanya the leader of the Basotho National Party objected to her decision, and subsequently organised a series of protests at the National Assembly buildings. The assemblys privileges committee subsequently found that Lekhanya and four other BNP members had threatened and intimidated Motsamai, and recommended that they be suspended from parliament without pay for up to five months. Sekhonyana was assassinated two days after that finding was handed down.  2012present  In February 2012, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili left the Lesotho Congress for Democracy LCD party to form a new party, the Democratic Congress. He was joined by 44 other members of parliament. When parliament returned, Motsamai who had joined the new party asked MPs to stand in the seats to show their support for Mosisilis government, and subsequently ruled that he still had control of the assembly and could thus remain in power. Her ruling was controversial, as Lesothos electoral law prevents members elected on a party list from switching parties mid-term. Thabang Kholumo, the deputy leader of the Popular Front for Democracy, said that Motsamais ruling was unconstitutional, as she had usurped King Letsie IIIs power to nominate the prime minister, while Tom Thabane, the leader of the All Basotho Convention, called for Motsamai and Mosisili to be arrested for treason. Mosisilis government was defeated at the 2012 general election, and Motsamai was replaced as speaker by Sephiri Motanyane. She was re-elected to the speakership in March 2015, following the 2015 general election, when the Democratic Congress returned to power at the head of a coalition government. She won the speakership election 6653, in a vote along party lines.

    "text": "A Continuous Drilling Provision or Continuous Operations Provision is a legal contract clause commonly found in oil and gas leases in the petroleum industry.  Definition  Generally, a continuous drilling provision allows a temporary cessation of production without automatically resulting in the termination of an oil and gas lease that has been extended by production. In order to qualify for the temporary cessation, certain operations as defined in the lease or by case law must be commenced on the leased premises or lands pooled or unitized therewith within a specified time period typically from 30 to 120 days.  For example  Notwithstanding the provisions of this lease to the contrary, this lease shall terminate at the end of the primary term or any extension thereof as to all of the leased land except those lands within any Governmental Section in which is located a well producing or capable of producing oil andor gas or on which lessee is engaged in drilling or reworking operations. This lease shall not terminate so long as drilling or reworking operations are being continuously prosecuted if not more than 180 days shall lapse between the completion or abandonment of one well and the beginning of operations for the drilling of another well.  Purpose  The continuous drilling provision was created in order to provide more certainty in the face of inconsistent court rulings. While a continuous drilling provision may provide the parties with a more reliable test to determine whether drilling and operations have been continuously prosecuted so as to hold a lease past its primary term, the inclusion of the provision could prove fatal to a lease that is held by production.

He received 8,080 votes 20.75, finishing third against New Democratic Party incumbent John Rodriguez.  Bob Fera Sudbury  Bob Fera is a former educator, and at one time served as principal of the largest separate school in Sudbury. He was an alderman and regional councillor before running for the House of Commons, and also served as Deputy Mayor in the mid-1980s. He opposed Sudburys move to market value assessment for property taxes in 1986, following significant rate increases throughout his ward. He moved a successful motion against Sunday shopping two years later, and was quoted as saying this community is not ready to trade in its prayer cards for VISA cards. Many believed that Fera was a New Democrat, and his decision to run for the Progressive Conservatives was greeted with surprise in some circles. Fera argued that the PCs were likely to win the election, and that Sudbury would benefit from having a member on the government side. He received 9,356 votes 21.99, finishing third against Liberal candidate Diane Marleau. Fera became chairman of the board of the Manitoulin-Sudbury Community Care Access Centre in 1996, and served as chair of the Ontario Association of Community Care Access Centres for a time. He criticized the provincial government of Mike Harris for its approach to home care in 1998, but welcomed the governments infusion of new money to the industry the following year. In November 1999, the Harris government appointed him to a provincial Round Table on Elder Abuse. Two years later, however, Fera argued that renewed government cuts in his sector were jeopardizing the service. His centre was forced to introduce severe cutbacks that same year, which Fera blamed on provincial underfunding. FHe later indicated that he was prepared to introduce user fees to prevent further cuts. Fera resigned his position in November 2001, in protest against the Harris governments efforts to restructure the provinces Community Care Access Centres the government had introduced legislation giving the province the right to appoint boards of directors and chief administrative officers. The board rejected his resignation, and he stayed to lead a province-wide protest against the proposed legislation. The legislation was nonetheless passed, and the Harris government dissolved the centres board in February 2002. Just before the boards dissolution, Fera sharply criticized the Harris government for firing its executive director, Bob Knight. Knight had previously criticized funding shortfalls, and Fera described his dismissal as a vendetta by the government to silence the opposition to the lack of funding in the home-care sector.

    "text": "The Stanley Royd Hospital, earlier named the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, was a mental health facility in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. It was managed by the Wakefield and Pontefract Community Health NHS Trust.  History  The facility, which was designed by Watson and Pritchett using a corridor plan layout, was opened as the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum in 1818. William Ellis, who had a reputation for employing the principles of humane treatment, was appointed the first superintendent of the asylum. John Davies Cleaton, who had previously held the post of Assistant Medical Officer at the Lancaster Asylum was appointed Medical Director before becoming a Commissioner in Lunacy in 1866. James Crichton-Browne, who was appointed superintendent at the hospital in 1866, went on to carry out pioneering research on the neuropathology of insanity. After the facility joined the National Health Service in 1948, it became the Stanley Royd Hospital. In a serious incident at the hospital in August 1984, 355 patients and 106 members of staff were affected by salmonella food poisoning; the outbreak led to 19 patient deaths. After the introduction of Care in the Community, the hospital went into a period of decline and eventually closed in 1995. The hospital has since been converted for residential use and is now known as Parklands Manor.  Mental Health Museum  The Mental Health Museum previously known as the Stephen Beaumont Museum of Mental Health, located at Fieldhead Hospital in Wakefield, contains artefacts from and exhibits on the history of the asylum. Artefacts include restraining equipment, a padded cell, photographs, medical and surgical equipment, and documents. There is also a scale model of Stanley Royd Hospital, which was the museums original location until the hospital closed in 1995.  Influence  In 1852, plans of the Wakefield Asylum were plagiarised by Francesco Cianciolo who submitted them as his own in a design competition for an Asylum for the Insane in Malta. Cianciolo won the competition and the asylum was constructed between 1853 and 1861; the plagiarism was only found out after construction had commenced. The Malta asylum is still in use as the Mount Carmel Hospital.

    "text": "Imzadi is a non-canon Star Trek novel by Peter David, primarily exploring William Rikers assignment to Betazed and his early relationship with Deanna Troi. Imzadi has a complex structure, involving time travel through the Guardian of Forever, but a straightforward plot of love and rescue. Trois history with Riker had been introduced in the pilot episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Encounter at Farpoint; this also included the word imzadi, a Betazoid term of endearment usually translated as beloved. The novel expands on the meaning of imzadi when Troi explains that its literal meaning is the first, not necessarily referring to the first sexual partner but, as Troi puts it to Riker, the first to ever touch your soul.  Setting  Chapters 1 to 6, an unnumbered epilogue chapter between chapters 10 and 11, chapters 34 to 36, and chapter 44 take place in 2408. Chapters 7 to 10, 33, and 37 to 43 take place in 2368. Chapters 11 to 31 take place in 2359. Chapter 32 takes place in 2364.  Plot  Seventy-three-year-old Admiral William Riker is a bitter, lonely man in a slow downward spiral following the death forty years earlier of Deanna Troi, who died of undetermined causes during a peacekeeping conference with an enemy race, the Sindareen. Riker, now the commander of an unimportant starbase, is summoned to Betazed as Deannas mother, Lwaxana Troi, lies dying. While going through Lwaxanas possessions after her death, Riker is reminded of how he and Deanna originally met and began their relationship on Betazed. In a lengthy flashback, it is revealed that Will and Deanna met when Will was stationed on Betazed between assignments, and while there attended a wedding at which Deanna was maid of honor. Will was instantly attracted to her and began to pursue her, though she initially rebuffed his advances, feeling that he was only interested in her physical attributes, and that he preferred quick, thrilling encounters over meaningful emotional intimacy. Over a series of meetings, however, they began to grow closer, as Will encouraged Deanna to embrace impulsive feelings and Deanna encouraged Will to explore his more spiritual side. While visiting her favorite museum, Deanna was kidnapped by a Sindareen raiding party, and Rikers Starfleet security force shot down their small craft in the jungle. Riker tracked them down and killed the only surviving captor, leaving Deanna and him alone together. In the jungle, they consummated their relationship, and Deanna told Will for the first time that they are Imzadi. However, after their return from the jungle, Lwaxanas violent objections to their relationship and Deannas seeming compliance led Riker to drunkenly fall into bed with another woman. Deanna discovered them together when she appeared at his living quarters, having planned to tell him she had decided to defy her mothers wishes. Deanna and Will decided not to pursue a relationship and Riker left the planet shortly thereafter, not to meet Deanna again until they were both assigned to the Enterprise-D. In the future timeline, Commodore Data, now in command of the Enterprise-F, tells Riker that scientists studying the Guardian of Forever have discovered that Deannas death was a focal point in time, causing the creation of a parallel timeline; his intention is to comfort Riker with the idea that Deanna lives on in another universe. Struck with a new suspicion, Admiral Riker has an autopsy performed on Deannas corpse and discovers that she had been murdered via a poison that did not exist at the time she died. Deducing that someone had gone back in time to murder her and deliberately alter the timeline, Admiral Riker travels to the Guardian of Forever and goes back to the time of the Sindareen peace conference on the Enterprise-D, a short while before Deannas death. He gives Commander Riker the antidote to the poison, and Riker administers it to Deanna. Her death is thus prevented, but Admiral Riker does not immediately return to his timeline, indicating that the danger to her has not yet passed. Commodore Data has also pursued Admiral Riker through the Guardian, feeling it is his duty to preserve the timeline by any means. He disables Commander Data and impersonates him, taking Deanna away from the peace conference with the intention of killing her. Admiral Riker realizes Data may try this, so he locates Commander Data and with him confronts Commodore Data, and they fight. As the peace conference attendees look on, Deanna finally becomes familiar enough with the representatives from the Sindareen a race difficult to read empathically without sufficient exposure to determine that they are deceiving everyone, and have no real peaceful intentions; the peace conference is only an attempt to stall for time so that their race can become more powerful. One of the Sindareen delegates is actually from the future and had decided to go back in time and kill Deanna to prevent this dis",

    "text": "Strathmore Football Club was a Scottish association football club based in the city of Dundee.  History  The club was founded in 1876, although it later claimed an earlier foundation date, and the earliest recorded match for the club is a 50 defeat to Dunmore on Magdalen Green in March 1877. The club took its name from its patron, the Earl of Strathmore. Into the early 1880s, there were few clubs in Dundee, and in 188081 the Strathie only played 6 matches, winning 2 and losing 4. By 1883 however there had been something of an explosion, with clubs such as Balgay, East End, Perseverance, and West End having started up, and the Strathie, as one of the oldest and best established, was also one of the largest.  Scottish Cup record  It was not however quite of the first tier locally. In the regionalized Scottish Cup, the club could never get past the third round, three times falling to the biggest Dundee club, Our Boys, at that stage; the closest the club came to the fourth round was in 188384, twice taking the lead in front of a 2,000 crowd at Rollos Pier thanks to a Taylor screw-shot from the by-line and Petrie finishing off a cross; Our Boys made the score 22 thanks to a freak goal as goalkeeper Jarvis accidentally carried the ball over the goal-line. In the replay at West Craigie, the Strathie took the lead through a Wilkie shot, before losing 51 - the cause not helped by an injury to full-back Christie taking him out of the game.  Forfarshire Cup  It faced similar difficulties in the leading local tournament, the Forfarshire Cup, almost always coming up short against the very top local sides; in 188788, the club reached the final after some considerable luck with the draw, but lost 102 to Arbroath at East Dock Street, in front of a crowd of 10,000. Its best season had come the season before, in 188687, when it surprised Arbroath with a 42 first round win, and beat Arbroathian namesakes Strathmore Arbroath in the second - the Dundee side winning 54, after losing a three-goal lead, and ending the game having to shelter the referee from angry home fans. In the final the club lost 42 to the reigning champions Harp of Dundee.  Burns Charity Cup  The club was similarly ill-starred in the local charity cups. Twice it reached the final of the Dundee Burns Club Charity Cup, in 188586 and 188990, but lost heavily both times - 51 to Harp in the first and 91 to East End in the second, spectators being said to have lost count in the latter final, but there was considerable mitigation for the Strathie, as it played much of the match with 10 men, inside-left Anderson retiring injured when the score was 20. The one consolation to the club in the 189091 tournament was beating Our Boys for the only time in a competitive match in the semi-final, 30 at East Dock Street.  Trying to join the Northern League  The clubs status was demonstrated by it not being accepted as a member of the new Northern League on its foundation in 189192, with only three clubs from Dundee being allowed in, and the voting being in favour of East End, Our Boys, and Harp; the Strathie was not even on the initial short-list of 12. The club applied to join in 189293, but only obtained 2 votes, five short of what was required; another Dundee also-ran club, Johnstone Wanderers, was elected. Strathie tried again in 189394, by which time Our Boys and East End had merged to play in the Scottish League as Dundee. Although the club lost in the vote to Victoria United, Aberdeen, and the re-elected St Johnstone, the club had a second chance as the cash-strapped Harp - faced with rampant professionalism and having to pay as much as 3 to secure players - withdrew in protest at the abandoning of minimum admission prices, which left a vacancy.  Merger with Johnstone Wanderers  After six matches in the 189394 season, both Johnstone Wanderers and Strathmore announced their resignations from the Northern League, on the basis that the gate money for matches at Montrose and Victoria United of Aberdeen was not worth the candle; the Strathie was facing eviction as the Dundee F.C. committee had bought out its ground, and had been looking to share Clepington Park which led to an assumption that the Wanderers and Strathmore were effectively acting as one club. That suspicion was confirmed in January 1894 when a new club, Dundonians, was formed by merger between the Wanderers and Strathmore, and played its first match under that name against Hibernian that month. As the media often referred to the Dundee club as the Dundonians, Dundee made a formal objection, and the new club instead used the Wanderers name, usually referred to as Dundee Wanderers.  Colours  The club wore the following: 188081: scarlet and blue 1 hoops 188182: scarlet and navy blue 1½ hoops 188284: light blue jerseys and hose, and white knickers 188492: 1 black and white hooped jerseys and hose, and navy k",

Reception  The AllMusic review by Alex Henderson awarded the album 2½ stars and states Tenderly is far from essential and isnt for those who have only a casual interest in Evans pianism -- this CD is strictly for collectors, who will want a copy despite its imperfections. The All About Jazz review by Derek Taylor observed Never intended for release, listeners expecting a tightly cropped and polished studio date are likely to be disappointed. Fantasy producer Eric Miller opted to leave those extraneous noises that did not directly compromise the music in the mix. The result is voyeuristic snapshot of two musicians playing purely for their own enjoyment, working out tunes on the spot and tinkering expressively with standard and blues building blocks.

The standard also provides the ability to control exactly what ATA operations are executed on a target device by defining three new SCSI operation codes: ATA PASS THROUGH A1h, 12-byte  28-bit ATA command without AUXILIARY or ICC fields ATA PASS THROUGH 85h, 16-byte  28- or 48-bit ATA command without AUXILIARY or ICC fields ATA PASS THROUGH 7Fh1FF0h, 32-byte  28- or 48-bit ATA command with AUXILIARY or ICC fields  History  The first SAT standard was finalized in 2007 and published as ANSI INCITS 4312007. It was succeeded by SAT-2 published as INCITS 465 in 2009, and SAT-3, which was finalized by T10 and is expected to be published as INCITS 517 in 2014. SAT-4 is in development. SAT has also been adopted in 2008 as an ISOIEC JTC 1SC 25 standard, namely ISOIEC 14776-921. SAT-2 was finalized in 2009. Significant additions in SAT-2 are ATAPI translations, NCQ control, persistent reservations, non-volatile cache translation, and ATA security mode translations. The standard also defines a new data structure returned in the sense data known as the ATA Return Descriptor that contains the ATA taskfile registers. SAT-2 was promulgated as ISOIEC 14776922 in 2011. The later standards are: SAT-3, finalized 2014. SAT-4, finalized 2016, added 32-byte ATA PASS-THROUGH command. Support additional AUXILIARY and ICC fields used by some ATA commands. SAT-5, started 2017, finalized 2023. SAT-6, started 2024. Adds translations for Command Duration Limits pages, power consumption pages, and CapacityProduct ID Mapping VPD pages. Adds GET LBA STATUS translation. DEVICE FAULT exit strategy. As of revision 02. The T10 committee makes the drafts of unpublished future standards freely available. As of September 2025, this means that the SAT-6 draft is publicly available for free. Drafts of published versions are only accessible by committee members. Members of the public are encouraged to instead purchase the published version. Drafts of earlier versions may remain available on the Internet from those who have downloaded them before their corresponding versions publication.  Applications  SAT is useful for enabling ATA-device-specific commands in a number of scenarios: SATA disks attached to SAS controllers PATA or SATA disks attached via USB bridges which actually speak SCSI over the wire either using the older USB Mass Storage Bulk-Only Transfer protocol or the newer USB Attached SCSI protocol. PATA or SATA disks attached via FireWire bridges which speak SCSI SBP-2 over the wire Some USB external storage devices, including some USB flash drives, are using SAT to achieve some advanced features like wear leveling andor TRIM A problem with many SAT implementations is that when two or more ATA devices are attached to the same SAT interface, the ATA passthrough only serves one device. This causes issues with fetching S.M.A.R.T. data, since only one device can be addressed.

    "text": "Illex illecebrosus, commonly known as the northern shortfin squid, is a species of neritic squids in the family Ommastrephidae. Squids of the genus Illex account for 65 of the worlds cephalopod captures. Illex is formed by four taxa distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean I. argentinus, I. coindetii, I. illecebrosus and I. oxygonius, whose identification and phylogenetic relationships based on morphological characters remain controversial.They are found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, from off the coast of eastern North America to Greenland, Iceland, and west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. They are a highly migratory and short-lived species, with lifespans of less than a year. They are commercially important and are fished extensively primarily by the United States and Canada, mostly for the Canadian and Japanese markets. Northern shortfin squid is a migratory species of squid with a distribution ranging from Florida Straits to Newfoundland in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The species is native to Canada, Greenland, Iceland and United States. The species has an average lifespan between 11.5 years in which most live less than a year. The location of the fishery of the squid is mainly in Mid-Atlantic Bight from between summer and fall.  Description  Northern shortfin squid is a moderately-sized squid with females ranging from 20 to 30 centimetres 7.9 to 11.8 inches in mantle length while males are generally smaller with mantle length ranging from 18 to 27 cm 7.1 to 10.6 in. Northern shortfin squid has short tentacles with a long and narrow head which is connected to the long mantle. The fins are shorter in length parallel to the mantle yet the length of the fins perpendicular to the mantle are about twice the length. The squid is reddish brown to purple in color and there is higher opacity in the head and mantle while the rest of the body are yellowish green tinted.  Migration  Distribution  Northern shortfin squid migrate from boreal and temperate waters to subtropical waters where they travel as far as 1,000 miles. The species is highly migratory as there are seasonal distribution patterns. The range of the species is between 66N and 29N where they are distributed in central Florida, Newfoundland and Labrador Spaws in South of Cape Hatteras to central Florida. They settle in oceanic and neritic zone of the ocean. There is high abundance of the species in Newfoundland and New Jersey.  Diet and feeding  The species mainly feeds on fish and crustaceans but it undergoes a shift from a crustacean dominated diet to a mainly fish diet. It feeds at night near the upper layers of water. Like other species of squid, cannibalism also occurs in smaller squids by larger squids. Based on the commercial catch of squid in Newfoundland in 1979, it was found that most squid prey on fish that are valuable for the market. The species feeds on many species of fish including Atlantic cod, hake, capelin, etc., in which their otoliths are found in the squids stomach.  Reproduction and growth  Spawning season for northern shortfin squid happens all year round. There are higher chances for the species to survive recruitment when it is spawned in the winter season because of the condition provided being optimal for the growth which supports the ability for the squid to perform spawning migration. The months for hatching range from June to December where it is more prevalent in July, August, September, October and November. It is found that sex does not affect the growth rate of the total body mass yet the month of hatching affects the growth rate to increase. Females grow faster compared to males and there is a linear relationship in the growth rate of the squid in which there is a swift growth measured by the increase of mantle length. Even so, the condition of the habitat also affects the differing growth rate of both sexes as male grow faster than females in Newfoundland and Nova Scotian waters. Juveniles range from the size of 34 to 66 mm 1.3 to 2.6 in while adults may reach up to 35 cm 14 in. It is found that northern shortfin squid who lives in warmer waters grow more rapidly especially in the Mid-Atlantic region.  Predation  Northern shortfin squid has developed behavior such as ink jetting, schooling and camouflaging as protection to prevent predation by larger fish species such as bluefin tuna, red and silver hake. Mammals such as pilot whales and dolphins also prey on the species.  References  Martínez, P.; Pérez-Losada, M.; Guerra, A.; Sanjuan, A. November 2005.

    "text": "youre charming is the third episode of the fourth season of the American dark comedy crime drama television series Barry. It is the 27th overall episode of the series and was written by Emma Barrie and directed by series creator Bill Hader, who also serves as lead actor. It was first broadcast on HBO in the United States on April 23, 2023, and also was available on HBO Max on the same date. The series follows Barry Berkman, a hitman from Cleveland who travels to Los Angeles to kill someone but finds himself joining an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau, where he meets aspiring actress Sally Reed and begins to question his path in life as he deals with his criminal associates such as Monroe Fuches and NoHo Hank. The previous seasons saw Barry try to decide between both lives, which culminated in his arrest. In the episode, Barrys actions unleash consequences, as Hank hires hitmen to kill him in prison. Meanwhile, Gene finds that his exaggerated description of his relationship with Barry may have severe consequences to Barrys incoming trial. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.208 million household viewers and gained a 0.03 ratings share among adults aged 1849. The episode received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the episodes humor, character development, performances and Haders directing. For the episode, Bill Hader received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.  Plot  As their crew is ecstatic over the arrival of the imported sand, Hank Anthony Carrigan and Cristobal Michael Irby meet with Toro Guillermo del Toro, who has agreed to send two hitmen to kill Barry Bill Hader. District Attorney Buckner Charles Parnell informs Gene Henry Winkler and Tom Posorro Fred Melamed that Barry is making a deal with the FBI and advises them not to talk. Gene tells Tom about the one-man performance he gave to Lon ONeil Patrick Fischler, causing Tom say that they must stop the article from being published. In prison, Barry has informed the FBI agents about Hank and Cristobals relationship. They intend to honor their deal, informing him that his companion, Sally Sarah Goldberg, will have to be questioned as she must leave her life behind. Lon ONeil visits prison for comment from Barry, who shouts that Gene should keep silent. Lon then visits Jim Robert Wisdom, telling him he spoke with Gene. Sally has started teaching her own acting class and the attendees are aware of her recent scandals. Fuches Stephen Root is discreetly told by Hank of the upcoming hit. Batir JB Blanc surprises Hank in the compound and offers him an ultimatum: kill the crew or be killed by Chechen reinforcements. Meanwhile, Gene and Tom break into Lons house, and meet Lons wife, who directs them to Jim. Jim rebukes Gene for talking and says that he spoke to Lon in his garage. Lon arrives home, with no evidence of anything, now speaking only in German due to Jims psychological torture. While hearing monologues, Sally is taken aback by a performer, Kristen Ellyn Jameson, who arrived unprepared. She humiliates her in front of the class as Gene once did to her and Kristen confidently recites the I am big! Its the pictures that got small line from Sunset Boulevard. Sally excuses her method as one of Genes, but the entire class leaves except for Kristen, who has booked a gig and wants Sallys help. Back in prison, Barry calls Hank and claims that Gene has information on the Chechens. Hank confronts Barry on his lies, stating he knows that he talked to the FBI. Inspired by Rain Man, Fuches decides to warn the officers about the hit on Barry, but isnt taken seriously. Barry has been escorted to meet WITSEC Agent James Curtis Dan Bakkedahl and identifies a nervous official to the agents as a hitman. The hitman, Nestor Fred Armisen, blows off his own finger with his faulty gadget gun pen. His brother Chuy, hiding in the ceiling, kills everyone but Barry, who retrieves a gun, kills Chuy, and sneaks away, while the prison is placed on lockdown. Warden Reynolds Richard Riehle and two guards arrive at the massacre with Barry nowhere to be found.  Production   Development  In April 2023, the episodes title was revealed as youre charming and it was announced that Emma Barrie had written the episode while series creator and lead actor Bill Hader had directed it. This was Barries second writing credit, and Haders thirteenth directing credit.  Casting  The episode featured a guest appearance by Guillermo del Toro, who appears as a criminal known as El Toro to help Hank and Cristobal in killing Barry. Del Toro had expressed admiration for the series and is friends with Hader, asking for a part in the series. Hader wrote the role specifically for him, and del Toro accepted, bringing his own cane to use in character.  Reception   Ratings  The episode was watched by 0",

Early life and family  The great-grandson of the Mayflower pilgrim John Alden, Ichabod Alden was born in Duxbury, Massachusetts.  Career  Appointed lieutenant colonel of the Plymouth militia regiment in 1775, Alden first saw action serving with the 25th Continental Regiment during the Siege of Boston. Following his promotion to colonel in November 1776, Alden was assigned to the 7th Massachusetts Regiment. The regiment was stationed at Cherry Valley, New York in the summer of 1778. Although commanding 200300 men, Aldens limited military experience and lack of knowledge regarding Indigenous tactics would prove to be a great disadvantage. He and several of his officers billeted well away from the fort in the homes of some of the inhabitants. Despite receiving a warning of an impeding attack from the American allied Oneida, Alden made few preparations. On November 11, 1778, a combined force of 320 Seneca led by Cornplanter and Little Beard, 150 Butlers Rangers and a detachment of the 8th Regiment of Foot under Captain Walter Butler, and a small group of Mohawk led by Joseph Brant launched a surprise attack on Cherry Valley. While the Rangers and regulars blockaded Fort Alden, the Seneca rampaged through the village, killing and scalping 16 soldiers and 32 civilians, mostly women and children, and taking 70 captives. Alden was killed attempting to reach the fort from an outlying house. His second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel William Stacy, was taken prisoner. The attack would later trigger an expedition led by Major General John Sullivan that destroyed 40 Seneca and Cayuga villages in the summer of 1779.  References",

    "text": "The Canon de 240 modèle 9396 TAZ was a French Coastal Defense and Railway gun used by the French Army during World War I and by the German Army during World War II.  History  Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. Big caliber land weapons were less prevalent than large caliber naval guns because of their weight, complexity, and immobility. This created a contradiction for artillery designers of the era. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didnt necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed.  Design  The Canon de 240 modèle 9396 started life as eight Canon de 240 de côte modèle 1893 coastal defense guns that were removed from fortifications at Dakar in Senegal and Saigon in Vietnam. Because of this, the guns were often referred to as colonies mounts. The eight gun barrels were placed on the existing rail carriages for the Canon de 305 modèle 9396 TAZ manufactured by the firm of St Chamond. The carriages were originally deployed in 1916 but it was too much gun for too little carriage so the 305 mm 12 in barrels were replaced with 240 mm 9.4 in barrels by St Chamond and entered service in 1918. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The guns sat on a top carriage traversing mount which sat on a large diameter geared steel ring. A rectangular steel firing platform sat on top of the platform with the barrel of the gun overhanging the platform at the front with an overhanging loading platform for the gunners to the rear. The firing platform was then traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base. To load the gun the barrel was lowered and there was an elevated shell handling trolley at the rear. The guns had a hydro-pneumatic cradle recoil system where the cradle recoiled up a slightly inclined 4 rear deck which helped return the gun to battery after firing. The gun could be elevated between 15 and 35 when firing across the tracks but was limited to 29 when parallel because the breach of the gun would not have enough room to recoil without hitting the carriage. The carriages consisted of rectangular steel bases, which were suspended on two railroad bogies. Each bogie had six axles. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. Since the barrels were coastal defense guns that were not intended for use at high angles of elevation the trunnions were relocated relatively far forward and the guns were nose heavy. The carriage used ground platform anchoring and site preparation included laying wooden beams parallel to the tracks then splicing in a section of rail bed reinforced with wooden beams under the center which the carriage was lowered onto. Outriggers and ground anchors were also used to stabilize the gun once in firing position as well as five screw jacks. Although the mount was capable to 360 of traverse it was often limited to 10 leftright of the centerline because of problems with balance and recoil which hampered the earlier Canon de 305 modèle 9396 TAZ. For this reason, the weapon was not considered a success.  Coastal defense  The eight Canon de 240 modèle 9396 TAZ guns remained in reserve between the two world wars and were mobilized during 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. Four guns were assigned to the 10th and 11th Heavy Artillery Batteries of the 374 Regiment of the ALVF Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferrée in the South of France facing the Italians. After the French surrender, the guns were assigned the German designations 24 cm Kanone E 558 f or 24 cm Kanone E Model 9396 f. In German service, they reverted to their coastal defense role and in 1942 they were integrated into Germanys Atlantic Wall defenses. Four guns were located at St. Nazaire in France while another four were located in Norway first at Narvik from 1942 to 1944 and later at Naerbo from 1944 to 1945.

    "text": "Amelia was built in France in 1787. The British captured her in 1793. She became a general trader that made one voyage as a whaler in the British southern whale fishery before returning to trading. She also made one voyage as a slave ship in the triangular trade in enslaved people. She was last listed in 1806, but the data is stale.  Career  Although the British captured Amelia in 1793, she does not appear in Lloyds Register until 1795. At that time her master is Whitock, her owner is Lushington, and her trade is LondonSt Vincent. In late 1795 and early 1796, Amelia sailed as part of Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christians expedition to the West Indies. After numerous false starts aborted by weather issues, the fleet sailed on 26 April to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada. It is not clear when Amelia returned to Britain. Lloyds Register for 1798 shows Amelias master as Scott, her owner as Lushington, and her trade as South Seas Fishery. Amelia was at Rio de Janeiro in June 1797 to replenish her food and water. She was reported to have been at the Galapagos in AugustSeptember 1798 She returned to England in March 1799. The Register of Shipping for 1800 reported that W. Scott was still master of Amelia, and that her trade was LondonCape of Good Hope. Lloyds Register for 1800 showed Amelias master changing to Higgins, and her owner to Sims. The 1801 volume confirmed the changes and showed Amelias trade as LiverpoolAfrica, something that generally signals a slave trader. Amelia, Isaac Higgins, master, John Sims, owner, sailed from London to West Central Africa on 13 October 1800. She sailed from Falmouth only on 14 January 1801. She arrived at Jamaica on 21 August 1801 with 267. Amelia left Jamaica for London, but then had to put back because she had become leaky.  Notes   Citations   References  Clayton, J. M. 2014.

History  The two antecedent regiments were formed in 1829 following the withdrawal of the regiments of Swiss mercenaries from Dutch service. Willem I ordered that two regiments would be formed to replace the Swiss, to serve as his guards. Both served with distinction, especially during the Second World War in the defence of The Hague. The regiment was formed in 1995 by the amalgamation of two antecedent regiments, the Garderegiment Grenadiers Grenadiers Guards Regiment and the Garderegiment Jagers Rifles Guards Regiment.  Organization  The regiments single battalion currently serves in the airmobile role as part of 11 Luchtmobiele Airmobile Brigade. It is organised with an HQ Company Stafcompagnie, a heavy weapons company Zwarewapenscompagnie and three infantry companies Infanteriecompagnie. The three infantry companies and the anti-tank company perpetuate the two antecedent regiments, with A Koningscompagnie and D Wolvencompagnie companies being classed as Grenadiers and B Stiercompagnie and C Tijgercompagnie Companies being classed as Jagers Rifles. The regiment has a museum in Arnhem.  Bands  Serving the Guards in musical support, the few numbers of military bands in service, are the Royal Military Band Johan Willem Friso and the Traditional Grenadier Bugle Band of the Grenadiers and Rifles Guard Regiment Grenadiers and the Veterans Fanfare band and Bugles and Fanfare orchestra of the Grenadiers and Rifles Rifles.

    "text": "Alfred Underwood April 1869  8 October 1928 was an English footballer who played 130 times for Stoke in the 1880s and 1890s.  Early and personal life  Alfred Underwood was born in April 1869, with the birth registered in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He was the youngest of six children to William and Louisa née Fowler; his father worked as a potters presser. Underwood worked as a potters flowerer as a child and worked as a potters presser as an adult.  Football career  Underwood was born in Hanley, Staffordshire and in his youth played in the local church league for Hanley Tabernacle and Etruria along with Bill Rowley. He and Rowley joined Stoke in 1887 in time for the first season of the Football League. Underwood made his league debut on 8 September 1888, at full-back for Stoke in a 20 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at the Victoria Ground. He played all of Stokes 22 Football League matches in 188889. Underwood played at left-back in Stokes first season in the Football League and missed only one match in the next three seasons at Walsall in 1891. He retired in 1893 when he was only 24 after he cut his knee and the wound became infected, although he was still called up to play occasionally afterwards. Underwood then worked in the local pot banks but suffered many health problems which led to his death in 1928.  Professional Baseball  In 1890 Underwood played professional baseball for Stoke in the National League of Baseball of Great Britain.  International career  He went on to win two full England caps, appearing alongside fellow Stoke teammates Bill Rowley and Tommy Clare.  Style of play  Underwood stood at 6 ft tall and weighed 13 st and along with Tommy Clare, formed an imposing barricade and were often referred to as a pair rather than an individual. Underwoods balding head and sunken eyes gave him a demonic appearance. His main assets were his heavy tackles and his long clearances. Members of the local press often criticised him for being too impetuous and rash. He occasionally mis-kicked his clearances and on one occasion against Accrington in September 1888, he hoofed the ball vertically in the air which resulted in Accrington scoring an easy goal. This led to The Sentinel claiming that Underwood should stop trying to break windows.

    "text": "The Lapérouse class was a group of four wooden-hulled unprotected cruisers of the French Navy built in the mid-1870s and early 1880s. The class comprised Lapérousethe lead shipDEstaing, Nielly, and Primauguet. They were designed to operate overseas in the French colonial empire, and they were ordered as part of a construction program intended to strengthen the fleet after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. They carried a main battery of fifteen 138.6 mm 5.46 in guns, had a top speed of 15 knots 28 kmh; 17 mph, and had a full ship rig to supplement their steam engines during lengthy voyages abroad. All four ships of the class were sent to East Asia during the Tonkin campaign, which led to the Sino-French War, in the mid-1880s. DEstaing saw action at the Battle of Fuzhou, the Keelung campaign, the Battle of Tamsui, and the Pescadores campaign, while Nielly took part in the Battle of Shipu. Lapérouse participated in the blockade of Formosa, along with her other two sisters, but Primauguet arrived too late to take part in operations against Chinese forces. In 1895, Primauguet served as the flagship of the Indian Ocean division during the Second Madagascar expedition, which resulted in the conquest of Madagascar. Lapérouse was wrecked at Madagascar in 1898, and the three remaining members of the class were withdrawn from service in 19001901. Nielly and DEstaing were broken up soon after being removed from service, but Primauguet remained in use as a hulk until 1907, when she too was sold for scrap.  Design  In the aftermath of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 18701871, the French Navy was forced to drastically reduce naval spending and consolidate its forces. The Navy adopted a new construction plan in 1872, which envisioned a fleet for operations in home waters and one to patrol overseas to protect French interests abroad. The squadrons that were to support the French colonial empire were to consist of a small number of second class ironclad warships supported by a large number of wooden cruising vessels. To provide new cruisers under the program, the French Minister of the Navy, Louis Raymond de Montaignac de Chauvance, forwarded a pair of designs to the Conseil des Travaux Council of Works on 8 March 1875. The minister had requested designs that strengthened the armament compared to earlier cruisers while keeping displacement similar, at the cost of speed. The two proposals, which the council reviewed on 28 May, were prepared by Victorin Sabattier and Arthur Bienaymé, the latter based on his earlier Infernet-class cruisers. They were similar vessels, armed with fifteen 138.6 mm 5.46 in guns, all on the upper deck, forecastle, and sterncastle. The council requested that six of the 138.6 mm guns be replaced with 164.7 mm 6.48 in guns. They also suggested adding a short section of armor amidships around the funnel uptakes, reflecting the experience at the Battle of Havana, where the French aviso Bouvet was disabled by gunfire that damaged her funnel. Sabattiers design became the Villars class, while Bienaymés proposal was chosen for the Lapérouse class, but neither of the councils recommendations were adopted. Bienaymés hull lines were superior to Sabattiers design, resulting in greater speed for the Lapérouse class. Four ships were ordered to the design: Lapérouse, DEstaing, Nielly, and Primauguet; Primauguet was initially named Monge, but was renamed during construction.  Characteristics  The ships of the Lapérouse class were 79.5 m 260 ft 10 in long at the waterline and 81.75 m 268 ft 3 in long between perpendiculars. They had a beam of 11.4 m 37 ft 5 in and an average draft of 5.3 m 17 ft 5 in forward and 5.8 m 19 ft 0 in aft. They displaced 2,320 t 2,280 long tons; 2,560 short tons as designed. The ships had a pronounced ram bow, a short, open forecastle deck, and an overhanging stern. They were wooden-hulled, but used iron beams to strengthen their structure. In 1890, Lapérouse had her forecastle enclosed, and she received a short spar deck around her funnel that provided additional sheltered space. An enclosed shelter for her bridge was installed as well. Their crew amounted to 264 officers and enlisted men. The ships propulsion system consisted of a single horizontal compound steam engine driving a screw propeller. Steam was provided by six coal-burning fire-tube boilers; DEstaings were ducted into a single funnel, while the other three ships had a pair of closely spaced funnels place side-by-side and partially enclosed by a single outer casing. Their machinery was rated to produce 2,160 indicated horsepower 1,610 kW for a top speed of 15 knots 28 kmh; 17 mph. All of the ships save DEstaing carried 317 t 312 long tons; 349 short tons of coal for their boilers; DEstaing carried slightly less, at 315 t 310 long tons; 347 short tons. At a more economical speed of 10 knots 19 kmh; 12 mph, the ships could steam for",

    "text": "Srinagar is a city in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the largest city and summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an Indian-administered union territory. It lies in the Kashmir Valley along the banks of the Jhelum River, and the shores of Dal Lake and Anchar Lakes, between the Hari Parbat and Shankaracharya hills. The city is known for its natural environment, various gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like the Kashmir shawl made of pashmina and cashmere wool, papier-mâché, wood carving, carpet weaving, and jewel making, as well as for dried fruits. It is the second-largest metropolitan area in the Himalayas after Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Founded in the 6th century during the rule of the Gonanda dynasty according to the Rajatarangini, the city took on the name of an earlier capital thought to have been founded by the Mauryas in its vicinity. The city remained the most important capital of the Kashmir Valley under the Hindu dynasties, and was a major centre of learning. During the 14th16th centuries the citys old town saw major expansions, particularly under the Shah Mir dynasty, whose kings used various parts of it as their capitals. It became the spiritual centre of Kashmir, and attracted several Sufi preachers. It also started to emerge as a hub of shawl weaving and other Kashmiri handicrafts. In the late 16th century, the city became part of the Mughal Empire, many of whose emperors used it as their summer resort. Many Mughal gardens were built in the city and around Dal lake during this time, of which Shalimar and Nishat are the most well-known. After passing through the hands of the Afghan Durranis and the Sikhs in the late 18th and early 19th century, it eventually became the summer capital of the Dogra kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. The city became a popular tourist destination among Europeans and Indian elites during this time, with several hotels and its iconic houseboats being built. In 1952, the city became the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, a region administered by India as a state, with Jammu being its winter capital. It was the flashpoint of violence during the 1990s and early 2000s insurgency in the region. In 2019, it became the summer capital of a smaller region which is administered by India as a union territory, after the former states reorganisation.  Etymology  The earliest records, such as Kalhanas Rajatarangini, mentions the Sanskrit name shri-nagara which have been interpreted distinctively by scholars in two ways: one being The city of Śrī शर, the Hindu goddess of prosperity, meaning City of Lakshmi and other being sūrya-nagar, meaning City of the Surya trans City of Sun. The name was used for an older capital in the vicinity of the present-day city, before being used for it. Between the 14th and 19th centuries, and especially during Mughal rule, the city was also referred to simply as Kashmir or Shahr-i-Kashmir lit. City of Kashmir.  History   Early history  According to the Rajatarangini of Kalhana, a capital city by the name of Srinagari was built in the Kashmir valley by Ashoka. Kalhana calls this capital puranadhisthana, Sanskrit for old capital, identified as present-day Pandrethan, 3.5 kilometres south-east of Srinagar. A new capital was built by king Pravarasena, called Parvarapura, in 6th century CE. Srinagari continued to be used as a name for this capital. This new capital was located at the base of the Hari Parbat hill on the right bank of the Jhelum, corresponding to the location of modern-day Srinagar. Kalhana describes the capital having several markets, mansions, wooden houses, grand temples and canals, and also refers to the Dal lake and Jhelum river. A long embankment was constructed on the Jhelum by Pravarasena to protect the city from floods, parts of which have survived to the present day. The two capitals are also mentioned in the chronicle of Chinese traveller Huein Tsang who visited the city in 631 CE. Although several other capitals of Kashmir were constructed by other rulers over the next few centuries, Pravarasenas Srinagar survived as the capital. The city was divided into several parts, each with its own guardian deity, which continue to be worshipped by Hindu Kashmiris. The 8th century scholar Adi Shankara visited the city and founded the Shankaracharya Temple here, at the site of the earlier Jyeshteshwara Temple. The city gradually extended to the left bank of the Jhelum river, and in the early 12th century the royal palace was shifted to this side.  Sultanate period  Rinchana, a Buddhist convert to Islam who briefly ruled Kashmir in the early 14th century, built the first mosque in Kashmir on the site of a Buddhist temple in a colony of Srinagar built by him.

Headquartered in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Brogent is a technology company using diversified software and hardware integration and rich experience in digital content creation to create cutting edge experiences for theme and amusement parks, museums, zoos, aquariums and other tourist destinations. The scope can cover software and hardware research and development, manufacturing and system integration, site design planning and construction. The company can provide single-component systems as well as complete turnkey projects.  History  In 2001 Brogent was established in Kaohsiung, and in the early days of entrepreneurship founder C.H. Ouyang led the team to complete many government and corporate bids for mobile application software interfaces and 3D websites. In 2008 E-DA Theme Park in Kaohsiung contracted Brogent to build a panoramic flying attraction called Beautiful Formosa. At that time, Brogent did not have any experience with simulator equipment supply. The companys team was a group of software engineers. Faced with the opportunity to deliver a unique project to E-DA Theme Park, C.H. Ouyang firmly believed that Brogent could develop the technology to supply this kind of media based motion base attraction and led the team to spend two years of research, and finally developed a now patented ride system and successfully opened a flying theater designed and manufactured in Taiwan in 2010. After integrating the technologies of various fields of expertise such as moving seats, audio visual systems and special effects systems and successfully opening the first flying theater attraction to the public, Brogent attracted the attention of the international theme park market and in 2010, it was contracted to produce Canadas first flying theater FlyOver Canada. The Flying Theater was built on the second floor of Canada Place, a famous cruise terminal in Vancouver, Canada, and in addition to the difficult on-site construction, it also faced the challenge of high-specification design changes. The team faced a lot of difficulties, but finally in 2013, FlyOver Canada was successfully opened, welcoming 4.3 million visitors with its first 10 years or operation. Since the first overseas flying theater Brogent has continued to expand its footprint in the location based entertainment market and is now in a leading position in the global flying theater segment. The majority of the projects listed on a blocoloop list of the worldss 13 top flying theaters published in 2020 is supplied by Brogent.

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions won re-election to a third term.  Background  Since 1980, Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and, until 2010, comprised a longstanding majority in the Alabama Legislature; see Dixiecrat. In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won Alabamas nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5 of the vote. The eleven counties that voted Democratic are part of the Black Belt counties, where African Americans are the majority racial group. On January 10, 2007, Rep. Artur Davis announced that he would not run for the seat. Despite voting heavily for George W. Bush in 2004, Alabama still had a strong Democratic presence in 2008, and Democrats controlled majorities in both chambers in the Alabama Legislature. Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Ron Sparks appeared to be preparing for a run, but on June 12, 2007, he announced that he would not seek the Senate seat, in order to avoid a primary battle with State Senator Vivian Davis Figures.

    "text": "Charles Joseph Finger December 25, 1869  January 7, 1941 was a British born American writer. He also directed an orchestra and taught piano.  Biography  Finger was born in Willesden, England, and educated at Kings College London. He had a strong literary and musical formation, and was quite active in the Fabian movement. Finger was a keen disciple of Walt Whitman. As a youth and young man he reveled in the homosociality of the Regent Street Polytechnic created by Quintin Hogg, and as a bisexual, throughout his life he sought to create communities of like-minded readers. Intrinsic to his literary accomplishments were his future life in South America and Texas, and his love of men. At age 20 he began to travel extensively, visiting first Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia, where he worked as gold seeker, guide, and cook for the first sheep farming stations, in the period of Selknam genocide. He moved to New York and London, thereafter, and to a number of cities in Texas. He worked as an accountant and musician, eventually settling in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he began to concentrate on writing. In 1902, Finger married Eleanor Nellie Ferguson, daughter of a sheep rancher, with whom he would have five children. He became the acting editor of the Reedys Mirror after William Marion Reedys death in 1920. Finger won the 1925 Newbery Medal for the book Tales from Silver Lands 1924, a collection of stories from Central and South America. Some of his other works are Bushrangers 1924, Tales Worth Telling 1927, Courageous Companions 1929, and A Dog at His Heel 1936. His autobiography is Seven Horizons 1930. Finger was an accomplished musician. He directed the San Angelo Conservatory of Music in Texas, from 1898 to 1904. One of his piano students in San Angelo was David Wendel Guion, who achieved notability for arranging and popularizing the ballad Home on the Range. Finger, whose daughter Helen Finger was a lithographer, took special pains to promote the work of Arkansas painter and lithographer James Duard Marshall. Helen Finger and James Duard Marshall had worked together teaching adult art classes in Fayetteville, Arkansas, under the Federal Emergency Relief Act. The epitaph on Fingers gravestone is This voyage done, set sail and steer once more To further landfall on some nobler shore. He is buried in the Farmington, Arkansas cemetery.

    "text": "The Rumberas film in Spanish, Cine de rumberas was a film genre that flourished in Mexicos Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. Its major stars were the so-called rumberas, dancers of Afro-Caribbean musical rhythms. The genre is a film curiosity, one of the most fascinating hybrids of the international cinema. Today, thanks to their unique characteristics, they are considered cult films. The Rumberas film is one of the contributions of Mexican cinema to international cinema. The Rumberas film represented a social view of the Mexico of the 1940s and 1950s, specifically of those women considered sinners and prostitutes, who confronted the moral and social conventions of their time. The genre was a more realistic approach to the Mexican society of that time. It was melodramas about the lives of these women, who were redeemed through exotic dances.  Etymology  The rumberas were the dancers and actresses that swayed to Afro-Caribbean rhythms in Mexican cinemas Golden Age of the 1940s and 1950s. The term rumbera comes from the so-called Cuban rumba that was popular in Mexico and Latin America from the late 19th century to the early 1950s. Eventually new tropical rhythms such as the mambo and the cha-cha-chá displaced the Cuban rumba as the most popular Latin music genre; the rumberas adopted these new rhythms and used them in their films.  Origins  The rumberas films have their roots in various film genres. The film noir, very popular in Hollywood and other film industries in the 1930s and 1940s, can be considered their cornerstone, given the urban environment of the genre. Film noir was characterized by having among its protagonists the femme fatales, the cabaret women who aroused the passions of men and were often the source of conflict in the plot. Gloria Grahame and Rita Hayworth created film noir images of women who enjoy singing cabaret and simultaneously make men suffer. Their other base was the Hollywood musical of the 1930s, epitomized by Busby Berkeley and his famous colorful and extravagant musical numbers endowed with a deep aesthetic expression. Although not in such stylized form due to limited budgets, rumberas films tried to imitate in their musical numbers the guidelines of the genre. Finally, the film genre was enriched by the Urban social cinema or melodramatic films, whose principal artisan in Mexico was the filmmaker Alejandro Galindo. All this mix of elements and genres can be considered the basis of rumberas film. In the Rumberas films the main heroines are women, generally humble and naive, who, because of a bad move of fate, are forced to fall into the underworld of prostitution and get involved with gangsters and pimps. These women suffered through most of the time. The plot allowing them only a few moments of pleasure in the movie. Invariably the sinner woman had to find her punishment. The stars of this genre became objects of worship, but also of criticism and contempt of the hypocritical judgment of the hearings. In general, Mexican cinema was characterized by representing the prostitute as the main figure on numerous occasions, from the good-hearted prostitute represented in Santa 1932, to the tragic prostitute reflected in Woman of the Port 1934. In the Rumberas films, these tragic heroines also danced and radiated sensuality.  Origins in vaudeville  The rumberas first came to the theatrical stage in the late 19th century, at the time of vaudeville and burlesque, accompanying the many comedians and buffs of Cuban origin who settled in Mexico City. From the early 20th century until the 1920s, in the age of the great Mexican vedettes of the frivolous theater as María Conesa or Lupe Vélez, rumba dancers began to emerge. Lolita Téllez Wood is popularly considered the first dancer to popularize West Indian rhythms. During the course of the next decade, many rumberas and vedettes from Cuba came to Mexico.  In the cinema  The concept of the rumbera has been embodied in Mexican cinema since the first talkies in the early 1930s. The actress Maruja Griffel was the first to dance the rumba, in the film Que viva México! Sergei Eisenstein, 1931. She was followed by others such as Consuelo Moreno in Mujeres sin alma, Venganza suprema?, Rita Montaner in La noche del pecado 1933, and Margarita Mora in Águila o Sol 1937. In addition, the Puerto Rican actress Mapy Cortés called The Rumbera Blanca was famous for dancing the conga in numerous films. Lolita Téllez Wood participated in three Mexican films: El rosal bendito Juan Bustillo Oro, 1936, Mujeres de hoy Ramón Peon, 1936 and Honrarás a tus padres 1936, the latter directed by Juan Orol, considered the spiritual father of the rumberas film. Juan Orol was born in Spain but grew up in Cuba, where he lived in the solares, as they are known in Cuba to the low-income neighborhoods. There he had much contact with people of African origin, who him taught all their dancing tech",

Witasek studied at the Botanical Museum in Vienna, working on material brought back from expeditions to Brazil and Samoa. Over eleven years, she published a number of papers on Solanaceae, Campanula, and Callianthemum.  Life  Witasek was born on 13 August 1865 in Vienna. Her father was a railway engineer. She initially worked as a school teacher in public schools in Vienna, and later in a school for girls. In 1899, she began studying at the botanical museum in Vienna. She published papers over eleven years, on the taxonomy, geographic distribution, and nomenclature of plants. She published a monograph in 1908 on Solanaceae in Brazil, using material from the Austrian Academy of Science expedition in 1901, led by Richard Wettstein. Witasek also published on the distribution of Campanula, and researched the genus Callianthemum. Her last major work, a monograph on nightshade Solanum plants, was published in 1909. This material came from the Samoa trip of Karl Rechinger and Lily Rechinger-Favarger.

    "text": "Andile Mbenyane born 15 March 1988 is a South African soccer player who spent most of his career as a forward for Chippa United in the South African Premier Division.  Career  Born in Paarl, he joined the academy of Ajax Cape Town and got his senior debut for that club in the 200708 Premier Soccer League. He did not break through in the first team, and was first sent on loan to Ikapa Sporting, then permanently to Chippa United. With Chippa United, he won promotion and helped establish the club in the Premier Division, and eventually became team captain. In 2019 he played his 100th Premier Division game for Chippa United. According to Mbenyane, the Chippa United squad was given a scare in the winter of 2019 when the club released 13 players, resulting in the remaining players no longer dragging their feet at training. In March 2020, it was reported that Mbenyane himself would be released by Chippa United after 11 years in the club. As the manager Rulani Mokwena allegedly had identified deadwood in the squad, there were talks about disciplinary problems and missing practices. Club owner Siviwe Chippa Mpengesi accused Mbenyane of growing too content in the club, and asked the player to come to the party and pick up his socks. The player was not released, however, and started yet another season with Chippa United in 202021. Mbenyane was injured during the spring of 2021, and could not take part in the 2020-21 Nedbank Cup final. Mbenyane was subsequently released during the summer of 2021. According to Chippa Mpengesi, this was painful, but happened at the behest of new manager Gavin Hunt. In the fall of 2021 Mbenyane reportedly trained with Second Division club BCM Stars. He was back in Chippa Uniteds matchday squad in February 2022. His first goal during this spell in the club came in the 2023-24 Nedbank Cup against Ravens. Mbenyane retired from soccer in May 2024.  Personal life  Mbenyane was married to Ahluma Nombulelo Kala Mbenyane, who died in a car accident in 2015. He later married Pakama Aba.  References",

    "text": "Dobrica Ćosić Serbian Cyrillic: Добрица Ћосић, pronounced dǒbritsa tɕôːsitɕ; 29 December 1921  18 May 2014 was a Yugoslav and Serbian writer, politician and political theorist. Ćosić was twice awarded the prestigious NIN award for literature and Medal of Pushkin for his writing. His books have been translated into 30 languages. He was the first President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with his tenure lasting from 1992 to 1993. Admirers sometimes refer to him as the Father of the Nation due to his influence on modern Serbian politics and the national revival movement in the late 1980s while his opponents use that term in an ironic manner.  Early life and career  Ćosić was born as Dobrosav Ćosić on 29 December 1921 in the Serbian village of Velika Drenova near Trstenik to parents father Žika and mother Milka d. 15 October 1984. Some sources have incorrectly stated his date of birth as 4 January 1922. Before the Second World War he was able to attend vocational agriculture school in Valjevo. He joined the communist youth organization in Negotin in 1939. When the Second World War reached Yugoslavia in 1941, he joined the communist Partisans. After the liberation of Belgrade in October 1944, he remained active in communist leadership positions, including work in the Serbian republican Agitation and Propaganda commission and then as a peoples representative from his home region. In the early 1950s, he visited the Goli otok political prison, where the Yugoslav authorities imprisoned political opponents of the Communist Party. Ćosić maintained that he did so in order to better understand the Communist system. Ćosić wrote his first novel Daleko je sunce The Sun is Far Away in 1951. The novel was a success and made him popular, launching him into a literary career where he could express his revolutionary ideals. By that time, he had quit working professionally for the Communist Party. In 1956 he found himself in Budapest during the Hungarian revolt. He arrived there for the meeting of the editors of literary magazines in socialist countries on the day when the revolution started and remained there until October 31 when he was transported back to Belgrade on a plane that brought in Yugoslav Red Cross help. It remains unclear whether this was purely a coincidence or he was sent there as a Yugoslav secret agent. Nevertheless, he even held political speeches in favor of a revolution in Budapest and upon his return he wrote a detailed report on the matter which, by some opinions, greatly affected and shaped firm official Yugoslav view on the whole situation. Parts of his memories and thoughts on the circumstances later will be published under the name Seven Days in Budapest. In late 1956 Ćosić was chosen to participate in the formation of a new program for the Communist Party. Tito and Edvard Kardelj both picked Ćosić to sit on the committee along with other prominent Yugoslav communists. When it was completed in 1958, Ćosić had claimed that he himself wrote parts of it, including the chapter on Social-Economic System. Ćosić was concerned about the programs neglect of culture and pressed for more attention to be given to the role of culture in socialism but Kardelj, who was the final arbiter, was unresponsive to these concerns.  In opposition  Until the early 1960s, Ćosić was devoted to Marshal Tito and his vision of a harmonious Yugoslavia. In 1961, he joined Tito on a 72-day tour by presidential yacht the Galeb to visit eight African non-aligned countries. The trip aboard the Galeb highlighted the close, affirmative relationship that Ćosić had with the administration until the early 1960s. Between 1961 and 1962, Ćosić got involved in a lengthy polemic with the Slovenian intellectual Dušan Pirjevec regarding the relationship between autonomy, nationalism and centralism in Yugoslavia. Pirjevec voiced the opinions of the Communist Party of Slovenia which supported a more decentralized development of Yugoslavia with respect for local autonomies, while Ćosić argued for a stronger role of the Federal authorities, warning against the rise of peripheral nationalisms. The polemic, which was the first public and open confrontation of different visions within the Yugoslav Communist Party after World War II, ended with Titos support of Ćosićs arguments. Nevertheless, actual political measures undertaken after 1962 actually followed the positions voiced by Pirjevec and the Slovenian Communist leadership. Precipitated by a slow economy, opposing sides came to use Ćosić and Pirjevec as proxies in their battles for a competing vision of Yugoslavia in the early to mid-1960s. As the government gradually decentralized administration of Yugoslavia after 1963, Ćosić grew convinced that the Serbian population of the state was imperiled. In May 1968, he gave a celebrated speech to the Fourteenth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Serbian League of Communists, in which he condemned the then-current natio",

    "text": "The Chalcedonian schism, also known as the Monophysite schism, is the break of communion between the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Great Church which later became the Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church in the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon. Although the bishops at Chalcedon greatly respected Cyril of Alexandria and used his writings as a benchmark for orthodoxy, opponents of the council believed that the Chalcedonian Definition, which states that Christ is acknowledged in Two Natures, was too close to Nestorianism and contradicts Cyrils formula one nature of God the Word incarnate. The Council had also deposed the Pope of Alexandria, Dioscorus, but his supporters continued to consider him their rightful Pope, refusing to recognise the council-appointed Proterius. The anti-Chalcedonian strongholds were in Egypt, Palestine and later Syria. Over the next century, their communities gradually separated from the official church of the Byzantine Empire, eventually becoming the Oriental Orthodox Churches. The imperial government made many attempts to mend the schism, generally by trying to compromise between the two positions, but these attempts only created further heresies and schisms. The Arab conquests of the Levant and of Egypt in the 7th century fossilised the schism, but ecumenical dialogue between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian Christians has been renewed since the 20th century.  Background   Council of Ephesus  Leading up to the 430s, the theological Schools of Alexandria and of Antioch had been developing slightly different views on Christology. Antiochene theologians such as Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret of Cyrrhus had a Word-man Christology, or Christology from below, which placed more emphasis on Christs humanity and free will, and the distinction of his two natures. Their view was that Jesus, the man homo assumptus to whom God the Word was conjoined, atoned for the sins of mankind through his perfect life and his sacrifice on the cross, after which God raised him up to heaven as a pledge of the salvation of all humanity. In contrast, Alexandrian theologians such as Athanasius and Cyril of Alexandria had a Word-flesh Christology, or Christology from above, which placed more emphasis on Christs divinity and its absolute unity with his humanity. In their view, the Word became flesh, not merely by indwelling a man but through a hypostatic union. He then tasted death in the flesh on the cross and rose from the dead, thus saving humanity not by a moral example but by being incarnate for our sake, since what is not assumed is not saved. Additionally, the See of Romes interpretation of its relationship to the other patriarchates Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch was increasingly diverging from their own. While the other patriarchates saw themselves as colleagues based on their autocephalous relationship to each other, the Popes of Rome believed that their position as first among equals and as the successors of Saint Peter gave them authority over the entire church. These divisions came to a head in April 428, when Theodosius II appointed Nestorius, a monk from Antioch, to be the Patriarch of Constantinople. Nestorius immediately outraged the population by preaching against the use of the title Theotokos Mother of God for the Virgin Mary, arguing that Mary only gave birth to Christs humanity, not his divinity. This was despite the title having a large role in popular piety, and having been used by previous theologians such as Athanasius, the Cappadocian Fathers, John Chrysostom, and even with reservations by Nestorius own teacher Theodore of Mopsuestia. Nestorius main opponent was Cyril, the Patriarch of Alexandria, who wrote him three letters. In the second letter, written in February 430, Cyril criticised Nestorius theology, arguing that the Word was not united to a man merely as a result of will or good pleasure, but became flesh as is written in John 1:14, and therefore the Virgin who bore the Word in his human nature can rightly be called the Theotokos. Cyril was more aggressive in his third letter to Nestorius, which further defined his theology and ended with 12 prepositions Cyril called on Nestorius to anathematize. Instead of cornering Nestorius, Cyrils third letter brought his own orthodoxy into question. Theodoret of Cyrrhus and Andrew of Samosata wrote rebuttals of Cyrils 12 anathemas, to which he responded with counter-rebuttals. Both Cyril and Nestorius wrote to Pope Celestine I of Rome for support, but he sided with Cyril. To settle the dispute, Theodosius II convened the Council of Ephesus. On 22 June 431, the council condemned Nestorius as the new Judas and deposed him. However, the dispute was not over, as John of Antioch arrived 4 days later with a group of Syrian bishops, only to find the council already finished and Nestorius condemned. He then excommunicated Cyril and everyone who had agree",

    "text": "Leo Kestenberg 27 November 1882  13 January 1962 was a German-Israeli classical pianist, music educator, and cultural politician. Working for the government in Prussia from 1918, he began a large-scale reform of music education Kestenberg-Reform which aimed to teach music to all, beginning with small children, and including the education of their teachers. In exile in Prague, he was instrumental in forming the and administrating the first international organization for music education, which became ISME. He fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and later moved to Mandatory Palestine, where he founded a seminary for music teachers and privately taught pianists such as Menahem Pressler and Alexis Weissenberg.  Life and work   Childhood and education  Kestenberg was born the son of a HungarianJewish hazzan in Ružomberok, then in the Kingdom of Hungary under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy. When he was four years old, the family moved to Prague and from there to Liberec two years later. Kestenberg received his first piano lessons from his father, then in 189495 from music director Gustav Albrecht in Zittau. After graduating from the Progymnasium, Kestenberg completed his schooling with the Mittlere Reife. At the age of 15, he began to study piano in Berlin with Franz Kullak. In 1898 he met Ferruccio Busoni, which led to an intimate friendship with him and his family, regarded as a turning point in his artistic life. After piano studies with José Vianna da Motta, Hermann Scholtz and Felix Draeseke, Kestenberg attended a master class by Busoni in Weimar in 1900 which introduced him to music by Bach, Schumann and above all Liszt. He joined the military band in Josefstadt the same year and began his concert career in Reichenberg as soloist in Liszts First Piano Concerto. He became musical adviser to the Volksbühne Berlin, and a piano teacher at both the Stern Conservatory and the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory. He began serving on the educational committee of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany USPD, which he had joined in 1900, publishing in the Sozialistische Monatshefte.  Berlin  In January 1906, Kestenberg gave his first piano recital in Berlin and became a sought-after and celebrated Liszt interpreter. In 1908, he married Grete Kussel; they had two daughters. He began his professional career as a concert pianist, which led to professorship in piano at the Musikhochschule Berlin from 1921 to 1929. He continued his cultural-political commitment, organising numerous artistic events within the framework of the USPDs workers associations and trade unions in the Freie Volksbühne Berlin and the Workers Singers Association, in an effort to democratising the arts. He was involved in the popular education project of the Kroll Opera from 1927 to 1930, in Paul Cassirers art magazine Der Bildermann in 1916, and supported the Commission for Exemplary Workers Furniture in 1912. In 1918, Kestenberg joined the Prussian Ministry of Culture as a research assistant, was appointed advisor to the art department in 1920 and headed the music department of the Zentralinstitut für Erziehung und Unterricht Central Institute for Education and Instruction. Here he not only supported the modernisation and professionalisation of school music education, but also directed the entire Prussian appointment policy for the Berlin theatres and orchestras. In his paper Musikerziehung und Musikpflege 1921, he established for the first time an overall educational plan from kindergarten to university, and for the popular cultivation of music, which then formed the basis for the Denkschrift über die gesamte Musikpflege in Schule und Volk 1923 requested by the Prussian parliament. With the support of the non-party Minister of Culture Carl Heinrich Becker, he was able to implement essential educational policy reforms in Prussia Kestenberg-Reform. The reform was gradually implemented in the form of decrees. In 1929 he was appointed a Ministerial Councilor. However, only a few days after his 50th birthday, Kestenberg was dismissed from all positions for political reasons on 1 December 1932.  Kestenberg decrees  Prüfung, Ausbildung und Anstellung der Musiklehrer an den höheren Lehranstalten in Preußen Examination, training and employment of music teachers at the higher educational institutions in Prussia Privatunterricht in der Musik Private lessons in music Schulmusikunterricht in Preußen School music lessons in Prussia  Prague  Immediately after the seizure of power by the Nazis, Kestenberg first emigrated to Prague in 1933, where he was able to reactivate his Czechoslovak citizenship. He soon established contacts with the foreign minister Kamil Krofta and with German émigré circles Oskar Kokoschka, Willy Haas, Ernst Bloch, Golo Mann and the Prague born Max Brod.

    "text": "Snakehead is the ninth episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode followed the Fringe teams investigation into horrible deaths caused by large parasitic worms erupting from their victims mouths. The case soon leads them to a Chinese gang and a black market of immunodeficiency medicinal drugs. Co-executive producer David Wilcox wrote the episode, while Paul Holahan served as its director. Andrew Orloff, the episodes visual effects supervisor, strived to makes the parasitic worms look as real as possible with the help of the actors and camera angles. It featured one-time guest stars Tzi Ma, Colby Paul, Ingrid Torrance and Jack Yang. Snakehead first aired on December 3, 2009, to an estimated 6.94 million viewers in the United States. Reviews of the episode were generally negative, as multiple critics expressed their dissatisfaction that little was learned about the series overall mythology.  Plot  In Dorchester, a damaged cargo ship from China washes ashore; all of the crew members seem to be infected with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Bostons Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate in the presence of a man Tzi Ma. While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter John Noble posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better. The Fringe team discovers a Triad gang member and ties to several shell companies the gang has set up in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis Ingrid Torrance, one of the companies large investors, but she seems unaware of her investments criminal background. While at her house, Peter Joshua Jackson observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia Anna Torv back to Jarvis house, and they learn that her son Colby Paul has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him to be able to go outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicines origins. Meanwhile, an invigorated Walter ventures out to Chinatown to find a herbalist for his research; unaware of the clerks connection to the case, Walter casually mentions the giant worms. Walter manages to lose Astrid Jasika Nicole, who was sent to follow him out of worry for his ability to travel alone. She goes back to the lab, but is attacked by Triad gang members intent on getting back the remaining worms. Unaware of this, a distraught Walter becomes lost and wastes all his bus money on wrong phone numbers, causing Peter to have to pick him up. Olivia talks to Jarvis, who finally admits to being aware of the medicine. She tells Olivia the whereabouts of the incoming ship, but they find it already empty. Peter and Walter return to the herbalist shop and discover the remaining passengers. The FBI storms in and the survivors are sent to the hospital for care. Feeling remorseful about the trouble he caused, Walter injects himself with a tracking implant and gives Peter the transponder.  Production  Snakehead was written by co-executive producer David Wilcox, who had also written the seasons third episode, Fracture. The episode gave television director Paul Holahan his first directional credit for the series. The episode featured one-time guest appearances by actors Tzi Ma as Ming Che, Colby Paul as Matt Jarvis, Ingrid Torrance as Elizabeth Jarvis, and Jack Yang as Tao Chen. The episodes visual effects supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios tried to make the parasitic worms look as real as possible. He explained, ...we just dont have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guys mouth, are interacting with actors performances and theyre shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guys mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest. Orloff continued, And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what were calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So were transferring not just the camera motion but also t",

    "text": "Hawthorn Books was an American publishing firm located in New York City that operated from 1952 to 1977. Originally founded as a subsidiary of Prentice-Hall, Hawthorn Books went out of business after its publishing assets were acquired by E. P. Dutton.  A Catholic Publishing House is Founded  Hawthorn Books was founded in 1952 as a subsidiary of Prentice-Hall by Kenneth S. Giniger, editor in chief PrenticeHalls Trade Book Division. With its offices located at 70 Fifth Ave, New York, Hawthorn Books became a leading publisher of Catholic books including such works as the 150volume Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Catholicism. The firm announced its plan to publish the English language version of the 150 volume encyclopedia in early 1958, after 40 volumes had already been published in France. Then on April 11, 1958, Hawthorn Books presented to Pope Pius XII the first copy of the St. Peters edition of a Catholic Bible that also included commentary from Rev. R. Byson; this book was a leather-bound edition, limited to 3000 copies, of a large folio format Bible. The Pope was so impressed with this new edition of the Bible that he wrote a note in which he stated that, We warmly welcome this new edition of a Family Bible for English-speaking Roman Catholics. The company rapidly expanded its catalog and published a total of 73 various titles in 1963 alone. While under the leadership of Kenneth Giniger, it was his intention to have Hawthorn Books publish non-fiction books of lasting value.  A New Direction  However, some time prior to December 1964, Mr. Giniger resigned as President and a director of Hawthorn Books. He was planning to establishing a new publishing company and was looking to possibly buy an English publishing house. After Giniger had resigned from the firm, PrenticeHall sold its subsidiary to Fred Kerner, a former editor of Hawthorn Books and later executive editor of Fawcett Publications. The purchase price was reported to be 1.5 million. At the time of the sale to Mr. Kerner, Gerald MacGregor continued to stay on with the firm as Vice President and General Manager. Then, in 1965, W. Clement Stone, an influential business man, philanthropist and self-help writer, became Chairman of the Board of Hawthorn Books. Stone intended to use the publishing company as a vehicle to supplement his magazine Success Unlimited.  The End of an Era And a New Beginning for the Company  In 1967 Hawthorn Books was sold to the Clement Stone interests, and again sold in 1977 to W. H. Allen. Hawthorn Books finally closed in 1977, but its publishing assets were bought by E. P. Dutton. The company was eventually bought and re-branded into Hawthorn Publishers in 2019, marking a new chapter while continuing its legacy in publishing. Our work at Hawthorn Publishers is built around our principles. We are dedicated to doing everything in the publication process to the highest standard. Our group thinks that each authors story is special and deserves to be treated with consideration and respect.  References",

    "text": "Tolberto III da Camino 12631317 was an Italian nobleman and military leader, a member of the Da Camino family.  Biography  The son of Guecellone VI da Camino, he was allied with his cousin Gherardo III da Camino when the latter became lord of Treviso in 1283. In exchange, he received the castles of Oderzo, Camino and Motta di Livenza, which he maintained after some controversies rose a few years later. In 1286 he was podestà of Belluno, while five years later he led an unsuccessful plot against Gherardo together with his brother Biaquino VI and the bishop of Belluno. The two brothers asked protection to the doge of Venice Pietro Gradenigo: in exchange, they ceded Motta di Livenza to the Venetians, starting the Republics expansion in the Veneto mainland. The two later occupied some territories near Prodolone in the Patriarchate of Aquileia, for which they were excommunicated by the patriarch. The latter, namely Raimondo Della Torre, withdrew the excommunication in September 1293, following the establishment of an arbitral tribunal which ascertained the damage caused by the two to the Church of Aquileia. After fasting on bread and water, the brothers had to promise never to cross the Livenza again, the natural border line between the Camino territories and Friuli. In his late life Tolberto reconciled with Gherardo, whose daughter Gaia he married to. In 1299 he became podestà of Treviso. After Gherardos death and the succession of Rizzardo IV da Camino, he supported the latters brother Guecellone VII 1312: however, a few months later he supported the plot which forced Guecellone to leave Treviso, effectively ending the Da Caminos lordship in Treviso. In 1317 he fought alongside the Trevigiani troops against Cangrande della Scala and the Count of Gorizia, but died suddenly in the same year.  Sources  Angella, Enrica; Pietro Bongi 1993.

    "text": "This article provides a list of autoimmune diseases. These conditions, where the bodys immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells, affect a range of organs and systems within the body. Each disorder is listed with the primary organ or body part that it affects and the associated autoantibodies that are typically found in people diagnosed with the condition. Each disorder is also categorized by its acceptance as an autoimmune condition into four levels: confirmed, probable, possible, and uncertain. This classification is based on the current scientific consensus and reflects the level of evidence supporting the autoimmune nature of the disorder. Lastly, the prevalence rate, specifically in the United States, is included to give a sense of how common each disorder is within the population. Confirmed  Used for conditions that have strong, well-established evidence of autoimmune etiology. Probable  Used for conditions where there is substantial evidence of autoimmune involvement, but the scientific consensus may not be as strong as for those in the confirmed category. Possible  Used for conditions that have some evidence pointing towards autoimmune involvement, but its not yet clear or there is ongoing debate. Uncertain  Used for conditions where the evidence of autoimmune involvement is limited or contested.  Integumentary system  The integumentary system, composed of the skin, hair, nails, and associated glands, serves as a protective barrier between the body and the environment. It also plays a critical role in regulating body temperature and maintaining fluid balance.

In women, it includes structures such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina, while in men, it includes testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate, and the penis. Autoimmune diseases of the reproductive system can affect both male and female fertility and reproductive health.

This section is included because some of these conditions are immune-related but frequently confused with autoimmune diseases. Others are conditions that have been historically speculated as autoimmune due to overlapping symptoms like inflammation, but have been reclassified or excluded based on current research.

    "text": "On 31 August 2023 at around 01:30 SAST, a fire engulfed an illegally occupied government-owned building in Johannesburg, South Africa; 77 people were killed and 88 others were injured. It was one of the deadliest fires in South African history.  The building  The building, 80 Albert Street, was built in 1954 as the head office of Johannesburgs Non-European Affairs Department, serving as a Pass Office for enforcing pass laws controlling the movement of black people into Johannesburg under the apartheid system. From 1994, the building housed a womens shelter later called the Usindiso Womens Shelter. In 2019, a clinic housed in the building was relocated by the member of the Mayoral Committee MMC for Health and Social Development, Mpho Phalatse, as the building was occupied by squatters and found to be unsafe. The building is marked with a heritage plaque narrating its history.  Fire  The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning on 31 August 2023, in the Central Business District, at a five-storey abandoned building on the corner of Delvers and Albert Streets that is owned by the city government and was taken over by gangs. It was being illegally occupied by as many as 400 impoverished peoplemany of them foreign nationals, economic migrants, and asylum seekersall of whom were being charged rent by the gangs. The cause of the fire is not currently known. It spread through the building, trapping many people due to flimsy partitions and gates between makeshift rooms constructed by residents. Many residents jumped from the windows of the building to escape, some of whom did not survive the jump. Firefighters found bodies piled up where they had died at a locked gate on the ground floor while trying to exit the burning building.  Aftermath  The fire brought attention to the hundreds of hijacked buildings in the Johannesburg CBD, typically overcrowded and unregulated and inhabited by impoverished and marginalised people including a large number of undocumented migrants to South Africas economic hub of Johannesburg. Some residents who survived the fire refused to board buses for relocation to emergency accommodation in community halls after the fire, fearing the relocation would be used by officials as an excuse for deportation, and being unwilling to leave behind the remains of their possessions in the burnt building. In January 2024, a 29-year-old man was arrested after he confessed to starting the fire. The man said he started the fire in order to get rid of another murder victims body on the orders of a Tanzanian drug dealer who also lived in the building. He is currently facing 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder. In September 2025, The man, who has since been identified as Sthembiso Mdlalose, said he was in the building but didnt start the fire. Later that same month, Mdlalose, who is now on trial, recanted his previous statement saying he was nowhere near the building when the fire occurred and was instead sleeping on the street.  Response  President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the site of the tragedy on 31 August, calling it a wake-up call. Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi announced an inquiry into the fire. While government officials blamed the crisis on NGOs, who prevented the previous attempts to evict occupiers from similar properties, NGOs and inner city property owners argued that it was the duty of the City of Johannesburg to maintain buildings, provide services and enforce safety regulations. South Africas courts have consistently ruled that evictions cannot proceed unless alternative housing is provided under the provisions of the 1998 Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act. Following the fire, the City attempted to disconnect illegal electricity connections from similar hijacked buildings in the city, but was met with strong resistance from residents.

    "text": "Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe born 1979 in Zabrze, Poland as Grzegorz Rossoliński is a GermanPolish historian based in Berlin, associated with the Friedrich Meinecke Institute of the Free University of Berlin. He specializes in the history of the Holocaust and East-Central Europe, fascism, nationalism, the history of antisemitism, the history of the Soviet Union, and the politics of memory.  Career  Rossoliński-Liebe studied cultural history and East European history at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt Oder from 1999 to 2005. He worked on his doctoral dissertation about Stepan Bandera and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists at the University of Alberta and the University of Hamburg from 2007, and defended his PhD at the University of Hamburg in June 2012. Between 2012 and 2014, he worked on a post-doctoral project at the Free University of Berlin on the Ukrainian diasporic memory of the Holocaust. He also worked as a research assistant at the Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and at the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies. He is the author of Stepan Bandera: The Life and Afterlife of a Ukrainian Nationalist. Fascism, Genocide, and Cult, a scholarly biography of Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, and an in-depth study of his political cult. From 2014 to 2018, Rossoliński-Liebe investigated the German-Polish collaboration in World War II. During this time, he was a Saul Kagan Fellow of the Claims Conference and a fellow of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah, the German Historical Institute Warsaw and the Yad Vashem International Institute for Holocaust Research.  Political reactions  Rossoliński-Liebe was invited in late February and early March 2012 by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, the German Academic Exchange Service, and the German embassy in Kyiv, to deliver six lectures about Bandera in three Ukrainian cities. The lectures were scheduled to take place in February and March 2012 in Lviv, Dnipro and Kyiv. The organizers, however, were unable to find a suitable venue in Lviv, and also, three of the four lectures in Dnipro and Kyiv were canceled a few hours prior to the event. The only lecture took place in the German embassy in Kyiv, under the protection of police. In front of the building, approximately one hundred protesters, including members of the radical-right Svoboda party, tried to convince a few hundred interested students, scholars, and ordinary Ukrainians not to attend the presentation, claiming that Rossoliński-Liebe was Joseph Goebbels grandchild and a liberal fascist from Berlin. In response to the harassment and threats made towards him during his lecture trip in Ukraine, the online petition For Freedom of Speech and Expression in Ukraine was signed by 97 persons, including scholar Delphine Bechtel.

    "text": "The Southside Irish: Taobh Ó Dheas is the part of Dublin city that lies south of the River Liffey. It is an informal but commonly used term. In comparison to the citys Northside, it has historically been regarded as wealthier and more privileged, with several notable exceptions. Malahide, one of the wealthiest areas in Ireland, is on the Northside, for example, whereas low-income districts such as Jobstown and Sallynoggin are part of the Southside.  Areas of the Southside  The Southside includes Dublin city centre south of the Liffey, including Grafton Street and other notable streets, and also inner city areas such as The Liberties  The Coombe and Temple Bar. Beyond the city centre, the Southside in the geographical sense includes the districts named here, most of the names being old, though many were until recent times rural townlands:  Postcodes  Traditionally, Dublin postal districts on Southside begin with even numbers, while those of the Northside begin with odd numbers. College Green for example, is in the citys D02 districtsimply called Dublin 2 in everyday speechwhereas the outer suburb of Tallaght is in D24. One exception to this rule is the Phoenix Park, which forms part of the even-numbered district D08, but is actually on the Northside. Historian Pat Liddy explains this discrepancy: Long before there were postal codes, the Jamess Street Postal Sorting Office looked after the Phoenix Park, because it was considered to be closer and more convenient than Phibsborough. Jamess Street continued in this role when the postal codes were introduced, so Dublin 8 it had to be. The outer edges of the Southside and substantial parts of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown contain those new A postcode areas that have been assigned to southern Dublin some A areas are situated in County Wicklow and County Meath and others lie across the Liffey in northern Fingal. These are separate from the traditional postal districts but have been unified with them under the new Eircode system. Blackrock, for example, is in Dublin A94, whereas Dun Laoghaire is in the A96 area. Since Eircode was implemented, Southside postal addresses now take two general forms, depending on whether they lie within the traditional postal district area or not. This is an example of a postal address within the traditional Dublin postal districts: The Shelbourne Hotel, 27 St. Stephens Green, Dublin 2, D02 K224. And this is an example of a Southside postal address from outside the traditional postal districts: The Mellow Fig, 5A Georges Avenue, Blackrock, County Dublin, A94 XK11.

    "text": "The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal is an expansion for the role-playing video game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks, released in November 2002. The first of two expansions released for Morrowind, Tribunal is set in Mournhold, the capital of the province of Morrowind, and a self-contained city disconnected from the original game. The central quests task the player to resolve the tensions between the King of Morrowind, Hlaalu Helseth, and the Living God Almalexia. The expansion includes quality of life additions, including alterations to the games quest journal and map. Developed following the release of Morrowind, Tribunal was based on earlier concepts and settings in The Elder Scrolls series. The developers aimed to create a self-contained experience that explored the characters and mythology of the Living Gods of the Tribunal, a key element of the narrative in the original game. Upon release, Tribunal received positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay improvements, greater difficulty, and setting, and criticism directed to the linear and short nature of the expansion and ongoing technical issues with the game. The reception of Tribunal influenced the games second expansion, The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon, released in 2003.  Gameplay  Gameplay in Tribunal is identical to Morrowind, with the game functioning as an extension of quests and open-ended locations to explore. The main addition to Tribunal is the inclusion of a city, Mournhold. Mournhold is not a contiguous part of the game world in Morrowind, and players are required to access the area through a teleportation service, with certain features such as levitation disabled to conceal the citys separation from the game world. Access to the content in Tribunal is possible after the player first goes to sleep, which will trigger the initial quest leading the player to a service that can teleport them to Mournhold. Tribunal features several minor quality of life gameplay additions, including the modification of the games quest journal system. In the original game, the journal records entries in linear chronological order, which can become lengthy and cumbersome as the game progresses. Tribunal introduces changes to the journal interface allowing a player to sort their journal by quest name and distinguish between active and completed quests. Other interface additions include the ability to annotate the games map. The expansion introduces hireable followers who can travel with the player. This includes a mercenary who can use weapons and armor provided by the player, so long as they are paid a regular fee. The player can hire a pack rat who can carry items from the players inventory. In addition, the Museum of Artifacts provides the player with an avenue to sell high-value items obtained in the original game.  Plot  The player is attacked by an assassin, later revealed to be a member of the Dark Brotherhood, an assassins guild. To find out more about the Dark Brotherhood, the player is directed to Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind. Upon arrival, the player locates and defeats the head of the Dark Brotherhood, and complete a series of side quests for the new King Helseth and the Living God Almalexia. Almalexia has ruled Morrowind for thousands of years alongside her fellow gods Vivec and Sotha Sil, who call themselves the Tribunal, and are worshipped by the Dark Elves. During the players visit to Mournhold, a group of mechanical creatures called Fabricants attack the Plaza Brindisi Dorom area. The creatures emerge from the statue in the middle of the plaza, revealing a secret passageway to a Dwemer ruin. Since the creatures are mechanical, it is suspected that the secretive god Sotha Sil is behind this attack. The player investigates the ruins and completes further quests in order to reconstruct Nerevars lost sword called Trueflame. Upon acquiring the sword, the player is sent to the Clockwork City in order to kill Sotha Sil. The player explores Clockwork City, finally arriving to find Sotha Sil dead. Upon leaving, Almalexia appears and alleges that she had killed Sotha Sil and instigated the attack in Mournhold, in order to gain more power and control over the citizens and the Tribunal. Driven mad by the Heart of Lorkhan, Almalexia perceived Sotha Sils silence as mockery. The player is then forced to kill her before returning to Mournhold. As the player exits Almalexias temple in Mournhold, the Daedric Prince Azura reveals that the Heart of Lorkhan drove Almalexia mad and made her hunger for more power, and that mere mortals cannot become gods without consequences. By destroying the Heart of Lorkhan and killing Almalexia, the player continues fulfilling the Nerevarine prophecies, particularly the death of the Almsivi Tribunal.  Development  The plot and setting of Tribunal was conceived during earlier development in earlier Elder Scrolls titles. Mournhold, the setting of Tribunal, featured as a loca",

    "text": "The Pratt  Whitney PW1120 turbojet is a derivative of the F100 turbofan. It was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.  Development  The development of the PW1120, according to Israeli Air Force IDFAF specifications, started in June 1980. It retained the F100 core module, gearbox, fuel pump, forward ducts, as well as the F100 digital electronic control, with only minor modifications. Unique PW1120 components included a wide chord low pressure LP compressor, single-stage uncooled low pressure LP turbine, simplified single stream augmentor, and a lightweight convergentdivergent nozzle. Full scale testing was initiated in June 1982, and flight clearance of the PW1120 was tested in August 1984. The PW1120 had 70 percent similarity with the F100, so the IDFAF would not need a special facility for spare parts. It would be built under licence by Bet-Shemesh Engines Limited in Israel. IAI installed one PW1120 in the starboard nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDFAF Number 33466-0327 to explore the airframepowerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as Kurnass 2000 Heavy Hammer or Super Phantom and to act as an engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant bay doors, new airframe mounted gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic throttle system. It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant controlairframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986. Two PW1120 powerplants were installed in the same F-4E and it was flown for the first time on 24 April 1987. This proved very successful, allowing the Kurnass 2000 to exceed Mach 1 without the afterburners, and endowing a combat thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.04 17 per cent better than the F-4E. This improved the sustained turn rate by 15 per cent, the climb rate by 36 per cent, medium-level acceleration by 27 per cent and low-level speed with 18 bombs from 1,046 kmh to 1,120 kmh 654 - 700 mph or 565 kn to 605 kn.

QB3s domain is the quantitative biosciences: areas of biology in which advances are chiefly made by scientists applying techniques from physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science.  History  QB3 was founded in 2000 as one of four Governor Gray Davis Institutes for Science and Innovation originally, California Institutes for Science and Innovation, or Cal ISIs. From a 2005 article written for the University of California Academic Senate: The Institutes were launched in 2000 as an ambitious statewide initiative to support research in fields that were recognized as critical to the economic growth of the statebiomedicine, bioengineering, nanosystems, telecommunications and information technology. Moreover, the Cal ISIs were conceived as a catalytic partnership between university research interests and private industry that could expand the state economy into new industries and markets and speed the movement of innovation from the laboratory into peoples daily lives Governors Budget summary 2001-02. The four research centers operate as a partnership among the University, state government, and industry, and each involves structured collaborations among campuses, disciplines, academics researchers, research professional, and students.  Campus sites  The tri-campus organization includes three research branches: QB3-Berkeley, QB3-Santa Cruz, and the Quantitative Biosciences Institute QBI-UCSF at the San Francisco campus. QB3-Berkeley: The Berkeley branch of QB3 is housed in Stanley Hall along with the Department of Bioengineering, but core research facilities are situated throughout campus, including the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Lab at Weill Hall. The Bakar BioEngineering Hub at Woo Hon Fai Hall houses Bakar Labs, a core incubator of QB3. QB3-Santa Cruz: At the Santa Cruz campus, QB3 forms part of the Genomics Institute and is headquartered in the Westside Research Park. The space was formerly owned by Texas Instruments as a semiconductor wafer fabrication plant. The facilities include a total of approximately 242,000 gross 154,000 net square feet, including a large clean room, a specially designed supercomputer center, and extensive space used for classrooms, laboratories, and offices. QBI-UCSF: QBI is situated in Byers Hall on the Mission Bay campus. Byers Hall, officially opened in 2005, also hosts the QB3 directors office and QB3 central administration. Many faculty labs are in Genentech Hall, an adjoining building.  Leadership  QB3 is directed by David Schaffer, a Berkeley professor with appointments in multiple departments who also directs the Bakar BioEnginuity Hub and its associated incubator, Bakar Labs. Each participating campus has a QB3 director who also is an active research scientist: Sanjay Kumar at Berkeley, Nevan Krogan at UCSF, and Ed Green at UC Santa Cruz.  Faculty affiliates  Research faculty affiliates are the foundation of QB3. QB3 has more than 250 faculty affiliates, roughly 100 each from Berkeley, UCSF, and UC Santa Cruz. The research interests of these faculty fall under the umbrella of the quantitative biosciences. QB3 scientists tend to be bioengineers, biophysicists, or pharmaceutical or computational biologists. Synthetic biology is strongly represented. Current and former members of QB3 include Shuvo Roy, Elizabeth Blackburn, Steven Chu, Joseph DeRisi, Jennifer Doudna, David Haussler, Jay Keasling, Arun Majumdar, Harry Noller.

    "text": "David Francis Herbert Marler born October 3, 1941, died January 2, 2025 was a Canadian lawyer in Knowlton, Quebec who specialized in transportation and international law. He has been a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions.  Early life, career, and family  Marler was born in Montreal, Quebec. After graduating from Malvern College in England, Marler received a Bachelor of Arts degree in literature from Bishops University 1962 and a Bachelor of Laws degree from McGill University 1965. He has published articles on maritime law, served as city councillor in Lac-Tremblant-Nord 197072, and been a director of the Brome Lake Chamber of Commerce. He is member of the United Church of Canada. Since 1995, was Senior  Managing Partner at the law firm of Marler  Associates. Marlers family has been active in politics and government for many decades. He is the grandson of Herbert Meredith Marler, who served as a cabinet minister in the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King, and a grand-nephew of George Carlyle Marler, who was a cabinet minister in the governments of Louis St. Laurent and Jean Lesage.  Federal politics  Marler moved to BromeMissisquoi in 2003 and ran for the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, after defeating Jacques Dalton for the nomination. He highlighted his support for provincial rights within the Canadian constitution and actively supported his partys promise for more free votes in the House of Commons of Canada. Marlers campaign manager described him as the least conservative of Conservative candidates. He finished third against Bloc Québécois candidate Christian Ouellet. In December 2006, Marler was appointed as a commissioner on the Eastern Townships School Board to replace an incumbent who had resigned. He did not seek re-election in late 2007. Marler left the Conservative Party in January 2008. He has said that he refused to accept thirty thousand dollars via the partys controversial in-and-out transfer scheme during the 2006 election, and that party officials later informed him they did not want him as a candidate in 2008. The Conservative Party rejected the accusation. Under the in-and-out scheme, the Conservatives transferred national campaign money into individual ridings and before transferring it out again to pay for national advertising. In this way, the party was able to avoid national spending limits. Marler has said that he refused the transfer because he did not know what the money was for and could not get a clear explanation from party officials. In the 2008 election, Marler published a piece entitled, Sixty-Six Said Yes; a Personal Account of a Campaign and a Scandal, covering his involvement with the Conservative Party. He ran as an independent, saying that a Conservative majority government would be dangerous for Canadian democracy. Marler died on January 2, 2025 in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

    "text": "The Dixie Mafia, or the Dixie Mob, originally referred to a loosely connected criminal organization that was based in Biloxi, Mississippi and which operated primarily throughout the Southern United States from the 1960s to the 1980s. It engaged in burglary, theft, robbery and fencing. Their activities eventually expanded into the illegal trade in tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and methamphetamine, as well as contract killings and blackmail. Some of the more well known members were Mike Gillich, Todd Anthony and Kirksey Nix. It is now a general term for independent gangs and criminal networks composed of White Southerners who engage in a variety of criminal activities, from drug dealing, pimping, gambling, robberies and burglaries to contract killings.  Early days  Beginning in the 1960s, the Dixie Mafia began working as a loosely knit group of traveling criminals performing residential burglary, robbery, and theft. The gang did not function with a set chain of command, with the concept that whoever made the most money deserved to be boss. Despite the informal structure, the Dixie Mafia had one rule that members were expected to obey: Thou shall not snitch to the cops. Unlike members of the American Mafia, the members of the Dixie mafia were not connected by family or country of origin. They were loosely connected individuals of many nationalities with a common goalto make money and wield control over illegal moneymaking operations by any means, including influence peddling, bribery of public officials, and murder. The gang became known for carrying out contract killings, particularly against former members. During its peak, from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, dozens of people were murdered usually shot by its members. Victims were most often murdered because they testified, or threatened to testify, against fellow members. The Strip in Biloxi, Mississippi, was home base for the Dixie Mafia, and Mike Gillich, Jr., was the groups unofficial but de facto kingpin. Of Croatian descent and from a large, poor family, he had raised himself in the citys Point Cadet section to become a wealthy entrepreneur along The Strip. He owned a string of motels and nightclubs that doubled as strip joints and gambling dens, as well as a bingo parlor. He was known and trusted by almost every member of the Dixie Mafia, especially those who trusted no one else. In the words of one investigator of the Sherry murders, Mr. Mike runs the criminals post office. Hes their banker. Gillich was also patron and protector of Kirksey McCord Nix Jr., one of the gangs most notable members. In December 1965, at the age of 22, Nix was caught carrying illegal automatic weapons in Fort Smith, Arkansas. An old friend of his, Juanda Jones, ran a bordello there, and Nix became involved with Jones adolescent daughter, Sheri LaRa. In later years, she played a key role in his operations, including direct ties to the murders of Vince and Margaret Sherry. Edward Humes, in his 1994 book, Mississippi Mud, chronicled their murders and the subsequent investigation of Gillich, Nix, Bobby Fabian, and others who were involved either loosely or actively in the murders. With the aid of his fathers connections in neighboring Oklahoma, Nix beat the weapons charges in Fort Smith and moved on to other crimes. He was suspected in the gangland-style murder of a gambler named Harry Bennett, who was about to turn states evidence against several Dixie Mafia members. Although Nixs involvement in Bennetts murder was never proven, this incident precipitated a string of killings that left 25 people dead in six states over the next four years. Nix was a suspect in the attempted assassination of McNairy County, Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, and in the murder of Pussers wife. Nix was also convicted of murdering wealthy New Orleans grocery owner Frank Corso. At the time of the murder, Nix was believed to be employed by Darrel Ward in Clarksville, Texas. Ward was a noted associate of Chicago Mob boss Sam Giancana, and is thought to have controlled organized crime and bootlegging throughout Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The Dixie Mafia was strongly connected to the State Line Mob and its leader, Carl Douglas White.  Dixie Mafias locales  The Dixie Mafias origins were in the Appalachian states, which had a regionalism dating back to the Whiskey Rebellion and the secessionist movement resulting, briefly, in the state of Franklin Eastern Tennessee. This view that the federal government is oppressive and that criminal enterprise against it is justified spread from its place of origin to wealthier regions where the Dixie Mafia operated; primarily in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, particularly around the cities of Birmingham, Baton Rouge, Hattiesburg, Corinth, Dallas, and Atlanta. Some of the groups criminal activities were in more obscure parts of their major areas of operation, making the group and",

    "text": "The Third Chimpanzee is the fourth solo recording by Martin Gore, the primary songwriter for the band Depeche Mode. The tracks were recorded in Santa Barbara in Gores home studio and released 29 January 2021 by Mute. It was his first solo release in six years.  Background  This is Gores first solo release since Depeche Modes induction into the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame. The record consists of five instrumental tracks with no vocal parts named after different primate species. The EP title refers to the Jared Diamonds 1991 book of the same name, in which Diamond, an evolutionary biologist and popular-science author, discusses the origins of human behaviour by showing the similarities between human behaviour and that of primates. The album cover was performed by a capuchin monkey. In the statement Gore explained: The first track I recorded had a sound that wasnt human. It sounded primate-like. I decided to name it Howler, after a monkey. Then, when it came time to name the EP, I remembered reading the book The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee. It all made sense to call it that, as the EP was made by one of the third chimpanzees.  Critical reception  At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, The Third Chimpanzee received an average score of 69, based on six reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews. Paul Simpson of AllMusic commented, Like all of Gores solo releases, The Third Chimpanzee unmistakably feels like a side project. Its intriguing to hear what sounds and moods he can create outside of the context of his band, but even compared to the more fully realized MG, the EP merely sounds tentative. However, its worth noting that the striking cover art was painted by Pockets Warhol, a capuchin monkey, which is fascinating. Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of Paste Magazine stated, On his new EP The Third Chimpanzee, Gore once again reaches for his usual trademarks: the clanging of synthetic marimba-like textures..., siren wails that conjure images of sentient machines crying out in torment..., throbbing bass interlaced with ticking beats... Absent are the pinging synth arpeggios that mimic nylon guitar strings. Or is it vice-versa? Either way, Gore does splash the tracks with some typically spartan electric guitar flourishes. Longtime followers of Gores work, though, might find themselves thinking theyve heard all of this beforemany times. They wouldnt be wrong. Robert Ham of Pitchfork Media observed, The Third Chimpanzee is his darkestand strongestsolo work yet. The five instrumentals, all of them named after different primates, have the overdriven sting of vintage industrial, with bone-shuddering bass and the nastiest synth eruptions that he has elicited since Depeche Modes 1997 album Ultra. The mood is feral and erotic yet curiously comfortable, as if Gore discovered his old bondage gear in the back of a closet and found that it still fits.

Biography  For several years Dominique Muller was a literary director at the éditions Ramsay. She took part to the Des Papous dans la tête radiko program on France Culture. In 1993 she won the Prix Roger Nimier for Cétait le paradis and the Prix du jury Jean-Giono For her autobiographical narration Les Caresses et les Baisers 1998. Les Malgré-nous 2003, which recounts the first Nazi raids in Alsace during the Second World War, obtained a great public success. In Désormais Venise 2005, Dominique Muller evokes her passionate love affairs with Maurice Rheims. In 1999, she launched into the historical detective novel genre with a series whose hero is the doctor Florent Bonnevy, nicknamed Sauve-du-Mal, whose investigations take place under the Régence of Philippe, duc dOrléans. A rationalist and follower of the ideas advocated by the Encyclopédistes, doctor Florent leaves his native Holland to settle in France. Having become a familiar of the Régent, who does not always trust him, he must hide his Jewish origins from his wife Justine. In Sauve-du-Mal et les tricheurs 1999, he investigates the past of a friend of Justine found dead in a maison close. In Le Culte des dupes 2000, he is the target of a sect worshiping the Egyptian gods who, under this cover, is trafficking young girls in a convent. Very well documented, the series Sauve-du-Mal observes a style in the manner of the writers of the eighteenth century.

    "text": "Gunter Silva born 1977 is a Peruvian writer.  Early life  Gunter Silva Passuni was born in 1977 in La Merced, Peru. He studied Law at the Catholic University of Santa María in Arequipa. He also holds an MA in Literature and Creative Writing awarded by the University of Westminster.  Career  He published his first short stories collection, Crónicas de Londres The London Chronicles in 2012, and in 2016 his second book Pasos Pesados Steps Through Fire, a novel about a young protagonist called Tiago E. Molina and his turbulent life in Peru during the armed conflict, the setting is the city of Lima at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s. Carlos Fonseca Suárez describes the novel as the epic of another lost generation that matures in the midst of a ruined and violent homeland. The book was warmly received by the critics, and in 2017 it won a grant from the Danish Arts Foundation, and was translated into Danish as Tiagos overdrevne og vildfarne eventyr. Neutrino, Cuaderno de Navegación Neutrino, A Navigators Logbook, the authors first exploration of non-fiction, was launched at the Lima International Book Fair in July 2024. Seamlessly combining diary and essay, it explores themes such as the authors illness, death, and existence, transforming everyday moments and details into profound meditations on human fragility, nostalgia, and uncertainty. The literary magazine Culturamas says about the book: Neutrino opts for a sober, intimate, and cerebral way of portraying fragility. Its aesthetic approach is an ethical one: facing what hurts head-on, but without embellishment or melodrama. He has been invited, among others, to the London Book Fair, Ricardo Palma International Book Fair, Guadalajara, Festival Literatura Copenhagen, and to the First International Conference of Contemporary Peruvian Writers Palabras Fuera de Lugar at Milan in 2017, organised by the Peruvian Consulate and the University of Milan.

    "text": "Brian Brooke Claxton 23 August 1898  13 June 1960 was a Canadian veteran of World War I, federal Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of National Defence.  Early life  He was born in Montreal and received his early education at Lower Canada College. He was a gifted student and entered McGill University in September 1915 after completing grade 11. While at McGill he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. After a year at university he left McGill in 1916 and enlisted with the Victoria Rifles of Canada.  Professional career and achievements  He served overseas with the Royal Canadian Field Artillery on the Western Front, and saw action, which experience marked him profoundly. He was promoted to the rank of Battery Sergeant-Major in the field and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Returning to Canada after the War, Claxton completed his course at McGill, graduating with honours in Law. He practised his profession in Montreal. In 1939 he was created a Kings Counsel. He had an academic post at McGill where he was associate professor of commercial law until 1944. Claxton was active in community service. He served as President of the Canadian Club of Montreal, Chairman of the Montreal branch of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, chairman of the Board of Governors of Lower Canada College from 1925 until 1934, and was a graduate fellow of the Corporation of McGill University. The burgeoning nationalism after World War I led Claxton to become involved in associations such as the Canadian League and the League of Nations Society. He was also an intervenor on behalf of the federal government in the constitutional issue concerning jurisdiction over radio broadcasting. He was active in laying the foundations for the establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Political career  His political career began in the general election of 1940 when he was first elected to the House of Commons as Liberal Member for the constituency of St. Lawrence-St. George, Montreal. He was re-elected in 1945 and again in 1949. He was appointed in 1943 as Parliamentary Assistant to the Prime Minister. He served in the federal Liberal cabinets of Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. In 1944 he was named the first Minister of the newly created Department of National Health and Welfare 194446. He was responsible for the organization of the department and implementation of the administration system for the universal Family Allowances social welfare scheme. In 1946 Claxton became Minister of National Defence in which portfolio he served until 1954. In 1947 he headed the Canadian delegation to the British Commonwealth Conference on Japan held in Australia. As vice-chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Newfoundland, in 1949 he signed the terms of union on behalf of Canada. He represented Canada at the meetings of the Defence Committee under the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., Paris and The Hague. As Minister of National Defence he guided post-war demobilization, helped shape Canadian Cold War foreign policy, and presided over Canadas participation in the Korean War. In 1947, Claxton reopened RMC as a 3-service cadet college offering a 4-year academic degree. He said, The role of the officer in modern war can only be properly discharged if they have education and standing in the community comparable to that of any of the other professions as well as high qualities of character and physique. In 1949 he appointed Rear-Admiral Rollo Mainguy to head a commission of inquiry into the so-called mutinees on several navy ships that year. The Mainguy Report found no sign of Communist subversion, and noted that the sailors involved had some justified grievances.  Family  Claxtons brother-in-law was Second Lieutenant Donaldson Lizars Savage who died on 15 November 1916 at the age of 20. Savage was killed in action in Somme, France the same year he graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada. Savage, who served in the 56th Field Coy, Royal Engineers, informed Claxton about the recruiting hazing practises then in place at the RMC. As Minister of National Defence, Claxton gave instructions that abuses would not be tolerated when RMC reopened after the war.  Later life  In 1954 he retired from politics, but continued to play an important role in the creation of the Canada Council. He was just sixty-one when he died. At his death in 1960, The Montreal Gazette wrote that the Honourable Brooke Claxton faced death  with unbreakable courage. He astounded associates by working hard right to the end and never relaxing his grip. He was honoured by the University of Saskatchewan with the degree of Doctor of Laws at its Golden Jubilee Convocation in 1959. The Brooke Claxton Building in Ottawa, where the Department of Health is based, was named in his honour.  Archives  There is a Brooke Claxton fonds at Library and Archives Canada.  See also",

    "text": "The concept of predictive power, the power of a scientific theory to generate testable predictions, differs from explanatory power and descriptive power where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained or described by a given theory in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding.  Examples  A classic example of the predictive power of a theory is the discovery of Neptune as a result of predictions made by mathematicians John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier, based on Newtons theory of gravity. Another example of the predictive power of theories or models is Dmitri Mendeleevs use of his periodic table to predict previously undiscovered chemical elements and their properties. Though largely correct, he misjudged the relative atomic masses of tellurium and iodine. Moreover, Charles Darwin used his knowledge of evolution by natural selection to predict that since a plant Angraecum sesquipedale with a long spur in its flowers exists, a complementary animal with a 30 cm proboscis must also exist to feed on and pollinate it. Twenty years after his death, a form of hawk moth Xanthopan morganii that did just that was found. Another example of predictive power is the prediction of Einsteins theory of general relativity that the path of light would bend in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This was experimentally verified by an expedition to Sobral in Brazil and the Atlantic island of Príncipe to measure star positions during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, when observations made by the astrophysicist Arthur Eddington seemed to confirm Einsteins predictions. Although the measurements have been criticized by some as utilizing flawed methodology, modern reanalysis of the data suggests that Eddingtons analysis of the data was accurate. Later, more precise measurements taken by radio interferometry confirmed the predictions to a high degree of accuracy.  Applications  The predictive power of a theory is closely related to applications. General relativity not only predicts the bending of light but also predicts several other phenomena. Recently, the calculation of proper time of satellites has been a successfully-measured prediction that is now incorporated into the method used to calculate positions via GPS. If a theory has no predictive power, it cannot be used for applications.

    "text": "Lady Xian or Hsien, Chinese: 冼夫人; pinyin: Xiǎn Fūrén; Jyutping: sin2 fu1 jan4; Vietnamese: Tiển phu nhân; 512602, also known as Lady of Qiao Guo or Chiao Kuo; Chinese: 譙國夫人, born as Xian Zhen 冼珍, was a hereditary chieftain of the Li people, born to the chieftain of the Xian tribe in Southern China, in what is now Guangdong. She has been deified as the Saintly Mother of Lingnan 岭南圣母. She died during a tour of Hainan. Former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai called her the First Heroine of China, and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin praised her as the role model that the later generations should learn forever. Lady Xian is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu 無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes by Jin Guliang.  Life  Lady Xian was born in 512 to the chieftain of the Xian clan of the Li people in Southern China. She lived during the Sui dynasty in what is now Guangdong in Southern China. Her family were hereditary leaders of their clan. She was a notable leader who successfully defended her clan against its enemies, eventually earning her title as Lady of Qiaoguo. Her clans people were in frequent conflict with neighboring clans. She often tried to prevent them from being involved in wars by relying on diplomacy and negotiations. Her brother Xian Ting, the governor 刺史 of Nanliangzhou 南梁州, was conceited from wealth as a result of being trading partners with the Chinese so he often harassed the surrounding counties or robbed them of their belongings, which made people in the Lingnan area miserable. Lady Xian often persuaded him not to do bad things so peoples resentment subsided gradually. Thus, thousands of people from Daner Commandery 儋耳郡 of Hainan were attracted by her fame and joined her. In 535, she married Feng Bao 馮寶, a Chinese general and son of Feng Rong 冯融, and encouraged an appreciation of Chinese ways among her people. She also helped her son Feng Pu 馮僕 with the local affairs. She was impartial and incorruptible when resolving the lawsuits. She would punish her clans people if they committed crimes. As a result, Feng established their authority in the local place. From then on, nobody dared to disobey the government decrees. Because she was a woman of a people who wished to remain autonomous from the Chen dynasty, her accomplishments shocked many Chinese. It is exceptional that any records of her written by Chinese historians exist at all. Emperor Chen Shubao of the Chen dynasty had been impressed with her achievements and bestowed her with many awards, including the title Lady of Qiaoguo. She died in 602 of old age and was honored with the posthumous name of Lady Chengjing 誠敬夫人.  Family  Among her children, only Feng Pu was known by name. He accompanied his mother into many battles, and like her, he was bestowed awards by the Chen emperor. Lady Xian had three grandsons named Feng Hun, Feng Xian, and Feng Ang. They were all bestowed awards by the emperor. During the Chinese New Year or other festivals, Lady Xian would take out all her gifts sent by the emperors of the Liang, Chen and Sui dynasties and placed them in the yard. She told her grandsons that You all should be loyal to the emperor. I had served emperors of three dynasties with loyalty! All these gifts granted by them were the reward of my loyalty. So I hope you all can think about that and be loyal to the emperor. Original: 汝等宜尽赤心向天子我事三代主唯用一好心今赐物俱存此忠孝之报也愿汝皆思念之!. She asked her grandsons to be loyal to the emperor as she did.  Main achievements   Cultural development  In the Southern and Northern dynasties, human trafficking was very frequent in this area. According to the biography of Wang Sengru in the Book of Liang, Wang Sengru was the Prefecture of Nanhai. Every year many foreign boats docked here because many people were sold in Gaoliang. These foreign businessmen traded their goods for people being sold here. At that time, many businessmen in this county made money by doing this trade, which the officials permitted and did not take any action to prevent it. When Lady Xian rose to power, she took efforts to promote Han feudal culture and successfully abolished the Li trafficking system. She told the Li people to do more good things and be loyal to the country. Moreover, she encouraged the Han Chineses intermarriage to the people of the Li, which greatly promoted the ethnic communication and integration.  Suppressing the Hou Jing Rebellion  In 548, Hou Jing rebelled against the Liang dynasty, which had a destructive effect on the whole country. In 550, Li Qianshi, the rebel leader from Gaozhou tried to entice Feng Bao to join the rebellion, but Lady Xian dissuaded him from joining the rebellion. He defeated Li Qianshis forces, thus helping general Chen Baxian suppress the Hou Jing rebellion. Her achievement is recorded in detail in the Book of Sui.  Quelling civil disturbances  In 558, Chen Baxian established the Chen dynasty. Xiao Bo, the feud",

He promoted to the second team, Jong PSV, for the 200506 season and regularly practiced with the first team. He was also allowed to join training camp for the Peace Cup tournament in South Korea, as part of the pre-season. In the match against Colombian club Once Caldas, Beerens made his first ever senior start. On 25 March 2006, he made his official debut for PSV in a 30 win over Willem II, where he came in for Arouna Koné. Beerens first official goal for PSVs first team came on 15 October 2006 in the home match against Roda JC.  NEC loan  On 30 December 2006, PSV and NEC agreed on a six-month loan. At NEC, he scored in the derby against Vitesse, among others. He also made his debut for the Netherlands U21 team during this period.  Heerenveen  At the end of the 200607 season, PSV wanted to extend Beerens contract, which ran for one more year. In July 2007, however, Beerens decided to sign a three-year contract with Heerenveen. In May 2009, Beerens signed a contract extension with Heerenveen until the summer of 2013. At Heerenveen, he grew into a fan favourite, playing almost every match under head coach Gertjan Verbeek. Although he appeared in almost every game in his final seasons, his playing minutes became less and less, as he had lost his starting place to Luciano Narsingh. This caused Beerens to hand in a transfer request; something Heerenveen was willing to cooperate on, due to his proven for the club.  AZ  In August 2011, Beerens moved from Heerenveen to AZ Alkmaar on a four-year contract, reuniting him with former coach Gertjan Verbeek.  Hertha BSC  On 11 July 2014, it was announced by German club Hertha BSC that they had signed Roy Beerens on a 3-year deal. He scored his first goal in a 42 win against FC Viktoria Köln on 16 August 2014.  Reading  On 16 July 2016, Beerens signed a three-year contract with Reading for an undisclosed fee. There, he played under head coach Jaap Stam, a fellow Dutchman. He scored his first goal for Reading in a 20 EFL Cup win against Plymouth Argyle on 9 August 2016.  Vitesse  On 31 January 2018, Beerens returned to the Eredivisie, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal. After a strong start in 2018, under head coach Henk Fraser, a conflict with his successor, Russian coach Leonid Slutsky followed. Beerens was benched afterwards. On 24 December 2020, he announced his retirement from football.  International career  In 2007, Beerens was called up by Netherlands U21 coach Foppe de Haan to be part of his squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands. Beerens participated in their second first round group match against Portugal 21 win to secure a semi final spot and to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the semi-finals against England 11, 1312 after 32 penalty kicks Beerens came on as a substitute and scored both penalties he had to take in the series. The Dutch went on to retain their 2006 title by beating Serbia 41 in the final. Beerens also played for the Netherlands at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He was first called up for the senior team for a friendly match against Ukraine in August 2010.  Style of play  Beerens has been described as a versatile winger that can play on either the left or right flank. Furthermore, he was technically gifted. During his career, he was renowned for his quick pace, and his ability to score goals and create chances for others.

    "text": "The Mexican box turtle Terrapene mexicana is a species of box turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of Terrapene carolina Terrapene carolina mexicana.  Geographic range  This species is endemic to Mexico. It is found in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and San Luis Potosí.  Habitat  It lives in areas with tropical climates within humid forests at shallow rainwater puddles.  Description  Terrapene mexicana can reach a length of about 1820 cm 7.17.9 in. The carapace is long and dome-shaped, with rather variable color and markings. The adult males show gray-blue nuances on the head and red or orange nuances on the front legs.  Biology  The Mexican box turtle does not have much information on them because very few of them are domesticated kept as pets. However, we do know that they have a lifespan of 100 years. Usually these turtles have water nearby homes and a bush to hide. Having a home by the water will attract insects, which are a big part of their diet.

    "text": "Cédric Wermuth German pronunciation: ˈseːdrɪk ˈvɛʁmuːt; born 19 February 1986 is a Swiss politician who currently serves on the National Council for the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland since 2011. He currently also serves as co-president of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland SP along with Mattea Meyer. He has formerly served as president of the Young Socialists of Switzerland JUSO and also a former vice president of the SP.  Early life and education  Wermuth was born 19 February 1986 in Jegenstorf, Switzerland, the older of two sons, to Otto Wermuth, a special education teacher, and Laurence Wermuth née Dind; 19532014. He has a younger brother Yann Wermuth born 1989. His paternal family originally was from Eggiwil. He had an italian-born grandmother from the German-speaking Trentino Alto Adige region who fled Fascism during World War II and came to Switzerland. Wermuth was raised partially in Stetten, Lenzburg, Bünzen, Boswil, Baden, and Freiamt. His upbringing included living on farms. Cedric Wermuth graduated from high school in Wohlen and attended the University of Zürich, where he studied political science, history, economics, and philosophy. He has a LicentiateMaster of Arts degree.  Political career  He became a member of the Young Socialists of Switzerland JUSO at age thirteen and Wermuths active involvement in politics began when he was fifteen. He wrote a letter to the editor criticizing one of the newspapers authors for deemphasizing right-wing politics in their town. He received a number of threatening and critical phone calls from readers; his parents struggled to protect him without sheltering him. In the mid-2000s, he became really politicized by his interactions with neo-Nazi groups at his school and worked hard to uproot anti-Semitic conspiracy theories such as those presented in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. He became JUSOs central secretary in 2005, and served as its president between 2008 and 2011. In 2010 he was sentenced to a fine for trespassing after having taken part in a squat of a hotel in Baden in 2009. During this time, he worked as a personal assistant to Urs Hofmann; and in development cooperation for Solidar Suisse. He served on the Baden Residents Council from 2010 to 2011. In 2011, just months after resigning as president of JUSO, he joined the National Council as a member of the Finance Commission and the president of a finance sub-committee. Shortly after, he was elected as the vice president of the Federal Assemblys SP. In 2015, he moved to the State Politician Commission and the Business Audit Commission, where he served until 2019 and 2020. He was also elected vice president of the SP Parliamentary Group in the Federal Assembly during this time. He was a candidate for the Swiss Council of States for the Canton Aargau in the Federal Elections of October 2019, but was not elected. But during the same election he was also a candidate for the National Council, for which he was re-elected. As of 2021, he is in his third legislative term and part of the Economic and Taxes Commission. He also consults for Spinas Civil Voices, a civil rights organization in Zürich. He and Mattea Meyer were elected co-presidents of the SP in 2020 as Christian Levrat stepped down. They received 96 of the vote. In the following months, opponents of the SP labeled Wermuth quiet and uninterested as opposed to Meyer, who they thought had more presence. In response, he criticized them for assuming she would be doing the secretarial work while he served as the face of their presidency. He also pointed out that Meyer was asked questions about workfamily balance during their campaign while he was not, and how her hate mail and criticism often contains sexual violence threats unlike his. He values working with many different personalities and ideologies. Despite not agreeing politically, he and Thierry Burkart, who also represents Aargau, established the Mittelland Rail Link Committee, which aims to improve transportation in the canton. He also collaborates with those within his party; he co-wrote Die Service-Public-Revolution, published in 2020, with author Beat Ringger and is currently writing a book with Mattea Meyer.  Political positions  Wermuth espouses left-wing politics and wants the SP to be more radical. While the SPs opponents call them the Prohibition Party due to the constraints they aim to put on corporations, Wermuth and Meyer want it to be known as the Freedom Party.  Climate change  Wermuth and his family live in a housing co-op, share a car with other families, and buy vegetables directly from the source to lower their footprint. He regards climate change as a class issue and wants to increase non-profit housing construction and expand solar energy both to save the environment and to improve quality of life for impoverished families. He thinks Switzerland should participate in the Green New Deal and that p",

    "text": "Old Northside is a residential neighborhood near downtown in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is bordered by 16th Street on the north, Pennsylvania Street on the west, Interstate I-65 on the south, and Bellefontaine Street on the east. The Monon Trail runs along the eastern edge of The Frank and Judy OBannon Old Northside Soccer Park. Old Northside was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and is home to many residences from the Victorian era.  History  Old Northside was a prominent residential neighborhood in the late 19th century, when many of Indianapolis wealthier residents built mansions in the area. Old Northside was home to Benjamin Harrison 23rd President of the United States, Ovid Butler founder of Butler University and other notable figures, including magnates of the L.S. Ayres department store. Indiana author Meredith Nicholson was also a resident for many years and wrote his most noted work House of a Thousand Candles while in residence. Old Northside was also the original location of Indianapolis Butler University, then named North Western Christian University, which was later relocated to the town of Irvington. The neighborhood began a slow decline in the early 1910s as architectural tastes changed and families built homes further north in Indianapolis. Over several decades, homes were demolished and others fell into disrepair. In 1937, the Homeowner Loan Corporation HOLC classified 73 Indianapolis neighborhoods into four categories based on perceived investment risk. The Old Northside was graded C, or hazardous, and colored yellow, and was surrounded by redlined neighborhoods. In the late 1960s, residents began restoring remaining buildings of architectural significance, and petitioned the city for historic recognition. By the 1990s, the Old Northside was gentrified, with the population of white residents more than doubling between 1970 and 2016. Old Northside received historic designation in late 1978 after adopting a plan for preserving the architecture and history of the neighborhood. Disagreement arose between those seeking National Register designation and lower-income residents of the Old Northside, who were represented by the Citizens Neighborhood Coalition and feared displacement from their homes. A 1979 IUPUI study determined that minimal displacement had taken place due to the historic preservation of the neighborhood. Preservation of the neighborhoods history is overseen by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission.  Residences and museums  The President Benjamin Harrison Home and the Morris-Butler House, both on the National Register of Historic Places, are located in Old Northside and are open to the public for tours and special events. In 20102011, the former Central Avenue Methodist Church, later known as the Old Centrum, underwent a multimillion-dollar major restoration as a performance venue and statewide headquarters of Indiana Landmarks and is now known as the Indiana Landmarks Center. The former home of Thomas Taggart is now the national headquarters of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity.  Parks  There are three parks related to Old Northside, all created with funding from the Old Northside Foundation. Great Oak Commons is a park created by the neighborhood from several empty lots and is landscaped as a Victorian walking park with a central fountain, gas lighting, a gazebo and a sensory garden filled with fragrant perennial flowers. Shawn Grove Park is a childrens park with play equipment. The Frank and Judy OBannon Soccer Park was created by the city of Indianapolis on the east edge of the neighborhood, with the help of Old Northside Foundation. It is now maintained by Indy Parks. It was reclaimed from abandoned space near the former Monon train tracks and is used by several childrens summer soccer leagues.  Neighborhood organizations  The Old Northside Neighborhood Association was created in 1979, and has been active in preserving the historic architecture of the neighborhood and providing cultural and social activities for the neighborhood. The Old Northside Neighborhood Foundation was created in 1990 to raise funds for neighborhood projects, including funding for the neighborhood parks and conversion of street lights to historically appropriate designs.

    "text": "Esther Seligson 25 October 1941  8 February 2010 was a Mexican writer, poet, translator, and historian. She was an academic, with a wide range of interests including art, cultural history, Jewish philosophy, mythology, religion and theater. She published books, poems, short stories and translations. She won the Xavier Villaurrutia Prize and the Magda Donato Award for her literary contributions.  Biography  Esther Seligson was born 25 October 1941 in Mexico City, Mexico, to a family of Orthodox Jews. She wanted to be a dancer, but her parents were strongly opposed, so she began studying chemistry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico before changing her academic direction. Seligson studied Spanish and French Literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico UNAM and earned a Masters in art history at the Instituto de Cultura Superior Institute of High Culture. She continued her studies at La Sorbonne and the University of Bordeaux, focusing on history, the Middle Ages, and philosophy. Later, she studied Jewish culture at the Centre Universitaire dEtudes Juives The University Center of Jewish Studies in Paris and Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. Seligson began publishing at the age of twenty-four in the Cuadernos del Viento de Huberto Batis and Revista Mexicana de Literatura. She published, her first book, Tras la ventada de un árbol, a collection of stories, at twenty-eight and followed it with Otros son los sueños which won the 1973 Premio Xavier Villaurrutia Xavier Villaurrutia Prize from the National Council for Arts and Culture. One of her most important works is La morada en el tiempo 1981, which evaluated the isolation of a Jewish believer throughout time. In her 1984 book, Diálogos con el cuerpo she looks at the body, the heart, lungs, stomach, as a lover, in a sensual discovery of their sensations. These were followed by Luz de dos 1989, which won the Magda Donato Award. She published many other works, mostly not for commercial audiences. Her last book, Todo aquí es polvo was finished three weeks before her death and was published posthumously.

    "text": "A Minoan Sarcophagus, also called a larnax, is among the major display pieces of the antiquities collection of the Museum August Kestner in Hanover, Germany. The larnax is dated to the fourteenth century BC, which corresponds to the Late Minoan III A period, and probably comes from the island of Crete. It entered the antiquities collection of the Museum August Kestner in 1989 inventory number 1989.30 Larnakes are pottery sarcophagi modelled on similar coffins in wood and were a standard part of Late Minoan funerary practices. Too small for bodies, they were used as ash-chests after cremation. The Hanover larnax survives largely complete except for the fragmentary lid. Missing portions, especially on one of the short sides, have been reconstructed in modern times. The remains of the lid have been connected together and partially restored. The lid is decorated with two bands of waves, one on top of the other. The lid has the form of a pitched roof, flattened where it meets the edge of the sarcophagus, so that it sits firmly on the sarcophagus. The sarcophagus itself is painted on all four sides in a single brownish colour, which is typical. As usual, the composition of the painted scheme is elaborate, but the technique is rather crude by the standards of earlier Minoan painting in palaces. On the main side, a tree is shown in the centre, with dogs on either side chasing after goats, which have been pierced by spears. One of the short sides shows two wild goats fighting each other, the other short side and the reverse have floral motifs. The interior of the sarcophagus is not nearly as carefully worked as the outside. At the edges of the longs sides, handle holes have been created, but on both sides they only survive at one end. The sarcophagus legs are protruding pillars at all four corners, which run from the rim to the ground. Apart from a column on the back side, which was decorated with floral patterns, all columns are decorated with thick painted stripes alternating with bare clay.

    "text": "Old-age and survivors insurance OASI, French: AVS German: AHV constitutes one of the main social security schemes in Switzerland. The federal law on OASI was passed on December 20, 1946, and approved by popular vote on July 6, 1947, by almost 80 of the votes. It was subsequently harmonized and coordinated with the federal law on disability insurance adopted in 1959. A series of ordinances, the most important being the regulation on old-age and survivors insurance, specifies this. From the January 1, 1948, date of its entry into force, this legislation underwent numerous modifications. Until 1974, the evolution of the OASI was a fairly accurate reflection of the post-war economic boom. Between 1975 and 2008, the OASI was subject to ten actual revisions and three minor legislative revisions. An 11th revision is under discussion in 2009. This is a pay-as-you-go pension system, the law on occupational pensions 2nd pillar being a funded pension system. The OASI also allows for a partial redistribution of wealth. According to the Federal Social Insurance Office, the OASI is the most important branch of the Swiss social insurance system.  Mandatory contribution  All people carrying out gainful activity in Switzerland are required to contribute, as well as, under certain conditions, people working abroad on behalf of an employer in Switzerland. Since January 1, 1997, date of entry into force of the last 10th revision of the OASI, widows and married women without gainful activity are now subject to the obligation to contribute. However, the contributions of a married woman without gainful activity are considered to be paid if the husband is in gainful activity and has paid at least double the minimum contribution. This rule is independent of sex: the husband without gainful activity of a woman who exercises gainful activity also does not pay a contribution if his wife has paid at least double the minimum contribution. Contributions are not capped and represent 8.7 of income for employees paid equally between the employee and the employer and 8.1 for the self-employed. People domiciled in Switzerland, but not engaged in gainful activity, are also required to pay contributions based on assets and income acquired in the form of an annuity. The minimum contribution for non-active people is between CHF 478 and CHF 23,900 per year.  History of the OASI   Before the introduction of the OASI  Until the 19th century, it generally fell to families, charities and churches to care for elderly people unable to work. There was also a rudimentary system of public assistance for the needy, although the rules were often restrictive. Between 1883 and 1889, Otto von Bismarck established social insurance sickness, accidents, disability and old age in Germany. At the same time, voices were raised in Switzerland to demand the establishment of social measures making it possible, in particular, to fight against the glaring poverty of working families. In 1890 the first constitutional basis for health and accident insurance was thus created. However, it took more than twenty years 1912 for a law to be accepted by the people and for this assurance to become reality. The introduction of old-age and survivors insurance was among the demands of the 1918 general strike. The constitutional basis of the OASI was created in 1925; a first project, however, was rejected by the people in 1931. During the Second World War 19391945, the Federal Council took advantage of its extraordinary powers to promote the development of social insurance. This is how he created the allowance schemes for loss of salary and earnings intended for the military  which today have become allowances for loss of earnings , the organization and method of financing of which served as the basis for the OASI. On July 6, 1947, during a second vote, the federal law on old-age and survivors insurance LAVS in French was widely accepted by the people. It came into force on January 1st of the following year.  Since the establishment of the OASI criar referencias  Since 1948, the LAVS has been revised ten times. Originally, the maximum pension was 40 francs, which would currently be equivalent, taking inflation into account, to 183 francs. The minimum pension today amounts to 1,175 francs. During the 7th revision of the OASI 1969, the amount of pensions was increased to 220 francs. During the 8th revision 1973, pensions were increased by 80 and, two years later, by another 25. Combined with additional benefits, introduced in 1966, the OASI pension guarantees the minimum subsistence level, in accordance with the aim enshrined in the Constitution. Since the 9th revision of the OASI, pensions are regularly adapted to inflation and price changes. In 1997, the 10th revision introduced the individual pension system, as well as income splitting. Each person thus receives their own pension, whatever their marital status, and the i",

    "text": "The Midnight Snack is a Tom and Jerry cartoon released on July 19, 1941. It is the second of the Tom and Jerry films, returning to the basic premise of the previous film, Puss Gets the Boot, following that cartoons Academy Awards nomination. This cartoon features the second appearance of Tom and Jerry, and is the first in which the characters are given their familiar names; in the first cartoon, Puss Gets the Boot has the cat named Jasper, and the mouse named Jinx.  Plot  The cartoon takes place in a kitchen at midnight. Jerry pokes his head out of the refrigerator door and steals some cheese, unaware that Tom is watching him. Tom weighs the mouse down enough such that he can no longer see in front of him. After Jerry falls off from a rolling pin, Tom emerges from his hiding place with a smug face. Jerry salutes the cat and returns the slice of cheese to the refrigerator. He then proceeds to steal just a tiny bit of cheese, but Tom stomps on his tail with one of his hind paws and replaces the cheese. However, the cat soon realizes that he has the free run of the refrigerator, so he places an iron on top of Jerrys tail and begins eating. Jerry frees himself, but is soon caught by Tom and returns himself to the iron. Tom then presents Jerry with the wedge of cheese, but the iron attached to Jerrys tail prevents him from reaching the cheese. Tom then proceeds to allow Jerry to lick some cream off a few donuts, and then the mouse gets sprayed with the rest of it, plus a cherry for good measure. Tom then smells the cheese, but soon sees that it is the wedge of cheese, much to his noses displeasure, and tosses it away. Unfortunately, the cheese smashes some crockery and wakes up Toms owner, Mammy Two Shoes, who goes downstairs. Tom quickly shoves Jerry into the refrigerator and hides. Mammy rushes in and opens the fridge, screaming in terror when she spots Jerry. Leaping onto a stool and comically hiking up numerous, patterned layers of underclothes, Mammy calls Tom who emerges and pursues Jerry. In the midst of the chase, Mammy leaves the room. Tom surprises Jerry behind a trash bin, but Jerry tricks Tom into looking over the bin and jumps on the pedal, sending it to crash into Toms face. Jerry then jumps into the toaster and Tom starts it. Jerry pops up, his tail is on fire, and cools it in a sink full of water, only to be chased again by Tom. Tom ends up losing his grip and gets his tail caught up in an ironing board, with his body facing the refrigerator. Jerry climbs down the blind, picks up a fork with his tail and stabs Tom with the fork, causing Tom to slide down the board and eventually breaking the plates, up a washing board, onto the grater and crashes into the fridge just as Jerry had planned. Mammy re-enters the room on the belief that Tom has caught Jerry and disposed of Jerry. Then she opens the refrigerator door to get Tom a bowl of cream, only to find Tom in the refrigerator, covered in food. Jerry overhears Mammy shouting at Tom and kicking the screeching cat out of the house while munching on his wedge of cheese and feeling very pleased with himself.  Voice cast  Harry E.

    "text": "Meridian is a 1976 novel by Alice Walker. It has been described as Walkers meditation on the modern civil rights movement. Meridian is about Meridian Hill, a young black woman in the late 1960s who is attending college as she embraces the civil rights movement at a time when the movement becomes violent. The story follows her life into the 1970s through a relationship that ultimately fails, and her continued efforts to support the movement.  Plot summary  Set in the 1960s and 1970s, Meridian centers on Meridian Hill, a student at the fictitious Saxon College, who becomes active in the Civil Rights Movement. She becomes romantically involved with another activist, Truman Held. They have a turbulent on-and-off relationship, during which she becomes pregnant by him. After Meridian has an abortion, Truman becomes far more attached to her and longs for them to start a life together. Later, Truman becomes involved with a Jewish woman, Lynne Rabinowitz, who is also active in the Civil Rights struggle, though perhaps for the wrong reasons. As time passes, Truman attempts unsuccessfully, to achieve personal and financial success while Meridian continues to stay involved in the movement and fight for issues she deeply believes in.  Themes and critiques  Walker wrote the novel at a time when many young black people were shifting away from supporting the practice of nonviolence and civil disobedience that had characterized the early years of the movement and had begun to take on more militant and extreme positions thereby alienating some supporters. Several literary critics believe that the novel is a critique of the Civil Rights Movement from that period. They interpreted Walkers work as suggesting that the revolution never addressed the suffering of women. Rather it perpetuated destructive and often chauvinistic values. Some critics thought that Walker used Meridian to showcase her womanist, as opposed to feminist attitudes. A strong believer in the inherent power of the woman, Walker depicts her title character as an innately tough and resolute person, though not one without problems. Walker argues that personal struggles are an unavoidable part of life. She believes this is how individuals overcome obstacles and ultimately define their characters. Meridian features earlier examples of strong female role models.  Disagreements in the civil rights movement  Throughout Meridian, Walker examines how Meridian, Anne-Marion, and other characters in the Civil Rights Movement have differing ideas of how to proceed for racial justice. Unlike her friend Anne-Marion, Meridian is not ready to become fully radicalized. Throughout the book Meridian risked her life to affirm the principle of integration, for it had already been established as law, rather than give up the practice of non violence. Toward the end of the novel, Meridian continues to risk her health and her own happiness to continue working in grassroots activism, long after the Civil Rights Movement, torn apart by differing ideas within the movement regarding the practice of non-violence, is declared over.  Motherhood  In Alice Walkers Meridian, the theme of motherhood is very prevalent but is not highlighted in the traditional way. Meridian who becomes a mother really young has an experience with motherhood most would frown upon. In most cases mothers decide to stick with the child they birthed because that is what most people do but Meridian chose the opposite. Meridian does not take the traditional route of motherhood but instead she defies society rules and creates a life suitable for herself. She decides to give up her son to follow her desires of going to college and being a writer. In the book, the examples of motherhood around Meridian were very heroic. However, this heroism was not out of strength it was out of necessity and Meridian sought to change that, with the action of giving up her child to pursue her dreams. Upon getting pregnant out of wedlock in Meridians teenage years she is expelled from school and forced to give up her education. Meridian after a few years decides to give up her son Eddie Jr because she realizes that her son had prevented her from achieving her dreams and ambitions. Meridian chose to give up her son because she did not want to repeat what her mother had done; her mother too had given up her teaching career upon having children. There are multiple other examples of the difficulties of motherhood in the book. Meridians friend Nelda is also forced to give up her education upon getting pregnant. Another example was a thirteen-year-old girl who killed her child and was in prison for that crime. While visiting the girl Meridians sympathies are not with the girls murdered child but rather her sympathies are with the young mother who killed her child. These girls had dreams which became paralyzed by their teenage pregnancies. Walker suggests in the novel that motherhood is not for all women d",

    "text": "Autodrom Chayka Ukrainian: Автодром Чайка, romanized: Avtodrom Chaika, formerly known as Chayka Motorsports Complex Ukrainian: Автомобільний спортивний комплекс Чайка, romanized: Avtomobilnyi sportyvnyi kompleks Chaika, is a motorsport racetrack in Ukraine, situated in Chaiky village, near the capital city Kyiv. The circuit was built in 1975, when the country was a part of Soviet Union; since the foundation of Fédération Automobile de lUkraine FAU in 1993, it hosts various regional racing series, such as Ukrainian Touring Championship and Superbike.ua. Chayka became very popular and known as the best track in USSR due to very fast sectors near the finish line and corners 2-4, that were known as so-called ears. The track was also difficult and dangerous, there was no runoffs, very close barriers, poor quality asphalt and bad landscaping. Chayka also had a shorter layout that cuts off the ears sector, it was only used for testing. During Ukraines independence the track was partially reconstructed with addition of the new layouts that allowed to host automobile and motorcycle circuit racing, karting, autocross, rallying, drift and drag racing competitions.  History   Soviet Union  The development of the circuit began in late 60s by Soviet DOSAAF, a society for cooperation with army, aviation and navy, which also built an airfield next to the track, carrying the same name. The configuration was based on various similar tracks of that time, the project was finished in 1971. The construction began in 1973 and finished in several years. June 27, 1975 circuit saw its first touring races,, which were Ukraines first national motorsport championship. Later that year the circuit began to host the USSR Circuit Racing Championship, that included formula racing. In 1976 the first race for Kyiv Ring prize was held, eventually it became an annual event. Also the track began to host the championships of Russia and Belarus. In 1977 the circuit hosted its first international series, called Cup of Peace and Friendship becoming the traditional season opener. Also in 1977 Chayka became the final stage for the Rally Russian Winter that started in Russia, went through Belarus and finished in Ukraine. In 1982-1983 a motorcycle speedway and a karting circuit were added to complex as a second construction phase, the karting pit building eventually became a center for a car tuning and modification community. In 1984 the first international karting race took place on Chayka. Following the fatal accident of Polish driver Christian Grochowski in 1983 it was decided to exclude Chayka from the Socialist Countries Cup, Soviet championship round also got cancelled that season. Without the international races organization quality declined, the races were rare and usually had a small amount of spectators due to lack of advertising. There were several attempts to fix the road, but theyve made the situation even worse, the track now obviously consisted of three different types of asphalt. In 1989 it was planned to invite an Austrian company to hold a reconstruction of the complex to raise the level of the track and to attract more tourists, but financial situation prevented this from happening. August 18, 1991 Chayka hosted the last race of the USSR Circuit Racing Championship. At the time Ukrainian drivers were already using the blue-and-yellow national symbolic that used to be banned.  Independent Ukraine  After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, DOSAAF property had been inherited by the Defense Assistance Society of Ukraine, this included the Chaykas airfield and racetrack. Due to a lack of funds, some infrastructure and equipment was sold to private owners. In 1993 the track began to host the Ukrainian Circuit Racing Championship organized by the newly-founded Fédération Automobile de lUkraine. At first Chayka was the only venue of the championship but since 1995 FAU began to add street circuits from various Ukrainian cities to the calendar in order to give it some variety. In 1995 and 1996 Chayka served as a closing stage for Rally Kyiv that was Slavutych automobile club and was a part of Ukrainian Rally Championship. Even with the money from the events the complex still couldnt afford a repavment of the roads that kept deteriorating making the track fall behind the FIA safety standards. FAU was finding a way to keep Chayka in the calendar, reclassifying it as a street circuit to ease the requirements, but simultaneously they were looking for its replacement. In 1996 Kyiv City Automobile and Motorcycle Club KMAMK recently founded by racer Serhiy Malyk tried hosting a race at the cloverleaf interchange of Kyivs newly-built Osokorky district but the racers didnt like its repetitive layout. Chayka hosted races for two more years until its state forced it out of the domestic calendar in 1998. The championship would return to Kyiv in 2001 when Malyk would reach a deal with Olimpiyskyi spor",

Discipline and combat efficiency have improved. We used to run with bobby pistols and sawn-off shots; now we have opportunities to work with tactical tank groups, armored vehicles, artillery support. We gradually developed our military science doctrinestarting with practice, not theory. In the course of training and fighting, the lads mastered tactics and small arms proficiency. Many new possibilities opened for us: we can operate independently on the frontlines, free of other subunits that constantly let us down in combat operations.

The epicenter of the attack was not near the people, so contact with the substance was minimal, which possibly saved livesbut there are still consequences. Currently its impossible to find out what substance poisoned people, because we are under complete blockade, and the site of the attack is under fire by the Russians to hide evidence of their crime. Regardless of the sudden international focus on the chemical attack, he went on to claim that thousands of civilians in the city had been killed and continued to be slaughtered by constant o",

    "text": "Herluf Trolle Land is an area in Peary Land, North Greenland. Administratively it is part of the Northeast Greenland National Park. The area has two clearly defined parts: Herlufsholm Strand, the flat southeasterly point of Peary Land, and the easternmost mountainous hinterland of the peninsula which rises to the north of Independence Fjord.  History  There are ancient archaeological remains in the area, including the frame of a 10.6 metres 35 ft long umiak and a number of camping grounds with abandoned utensils, that were found at excavations in Herlufsholm Strand. This coastal zone may be the first place of the eastward spreading of the early Arctic Whale Hunting Culture from Alaska. In 1900 Robert Peary discerned Cape Clarence Wyckoff, a broad headland on the northeastern shore of Herluf Trolle Land, from Wyckoff Island, a place by the shore which Peary mistook for an island. It was the farthest point that he reached after rounding the northern end of Greenland. The coast south of this cape was explored by J.P. Koch in the course of the 1906-08 Danmark Expedition and was named after historical Danish mariner Herluf Trolle 1516  1565. Later it would be mapped accurately by Lauge Koch by means of surveys that he undertook during the Danish Bicentenary Jubilee Expedition in 1920-23 and the cartographic air expedition of 1938.  Geography  Herluf Trolle Land is located in southeastern Peary Land, on the northern side of the mouth area of the Independence Fjord. The limits of the territory are not clearly defined. To the west it is bounded by Melville Land, and to the north by the G.B. Schley Fjord. Herluf Trolle Land is the mountainous sector located to the west of Herlufsholm Strand. There are several low mountain ranges in the northeastern portion of the territory and two small ice caps. In the north a mountainous plateau rises to a height of 914 metres 2,999 ft and 853 metres 2,799 ft high Mount Clarence Wyckoff rises near Hellefisk Fjord. Except for these heights the area is largely ice-free. The plains bordering the mountain zone are crossed by numerous rivers.  Herlufsholm Strand  The coastal zone is known as Herlufsholm Strand, a broad, low-lying strip of land between the Wandel Sea shore to the east and the mountains of the interior to the west. It extends between Cape Eigil Knuth Kap København and Cape Henry Parish, with Cape Eiler Rasmussen as the easternmost point. Mudder Bay Mudderbugten, a 9.2 kilometres 30,184 ft wide, open bay, is located near the southern limit by Cape Eigil Knuth. The sea facing the Herlufsholm Strand shore is frozen throughout the entire year. Mount Henry Parish rises near the northern end and Kjovesletten is a coastal flatland that lies to the southwest. There are muskoxen in the area.  Bibliography  H.P. Trettin ed., Geology of the Innuitian Orogen and Arctic Platform of Canada and Greenland. 1991 B.

    "text": "Water is considered a purifier in most religions.  Holy water  Some faiths use water especially prepared for religious purposes holy water in most Christian denominations, mambuha in Mandaeism, amrita in Sikhism and Hinduism. Many religions also consider particular sources or bodies of water to be sacred or at least auspicious; examples include Lourdes in Roman Catholicism, the Jordan River at least symbolically in some Christian churches and Mandaeism called Yardena, the Zamzam Well in Islam and the River Ganges among many others in Hinduism.  Ritual washing  Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ablution include Christianity, Mandaeism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, Islam, the Baháʼí Faith, Shinto, Taoism, and the Rastafari movement. Immersion or aspersion or affusion of a person in water is a central sacrament of Christianity where it is called baptism; it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Mandaeism masbuta, Judaism mikvah and Sikhism Amrit Sanskar. In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Judaism, Mandaeism and Islam. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases see Tayammum after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water wudu. In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area e.g., in the ritual of misogi.  Immersion of deities  In Hinduism, statues of Durga and Ganesh are immersed in rivers at the final stages of the festivals Durga Puja and Ganesh Chaturthi respectively. In Christianity, the baptism of Jesus is an important moment in Christian theology and is celebrated in Western Christianity as Epiphany. In the Christian East this feast is celebrated as Theophany on January 6.  Water deities  Water deities are usually a focus of worship at specific springs or holy wells, but there are also more abstract ocean deities, and deities representing water as an abstract element, such as Aban in Zoroastrianism. Example for local tutelary water deities include Celtic Sulis, worshipped at the thermal spring at Bath, or Ganges in Hinduism, personified as a goddess. The Hindu goddess Saraswati originated as a personification of the Saraswati River in the Rigveda, but became a more abstract deity of wisdom in Hinduism. African examples include the Yoruba river goddess Oshun, the Igbo lake goddess Ogbuide Uhammiri, the Igbo river goddess Idemili and Agulu Lake Achebe.

    "text": "The Piviale dei Pappagalli English: Parrot Cope is a liturgical Cope which was created in the 13th century in Sicily. As the name suggests, parrots are depicted on the coat and are repeated all over the textile. The origin and history surrounding the Cope, as well the precious materials and craftmanship make it to an important textile held within the permanent collection of the Diocesan Museum of Vicenza.  History   Donation  There remains a debate at the heart of the Piviale dei Pappagalli history between two conflicting histories. The most popular theory is that the object was donated from King Louis IX of France to Bartolomeo da Breganze alongside the reliquaries of the Thorn of Christ and of the True Cross 1259. During the Bishops return to Vicenza 1260, he constructed the Church of Santa Corona as a place for these relics, the location of which has a symbolic meaning as it was previously a place for the Cathars, who were heretics, hence the presence of the relics and church acted as a cleanser and purifier for this previous perceived evil. As this textile is said to be produced in a Sicilian workshop, it is important to stress King Louis IX connection to Sicily which is made clear through his brother Younger Brother Charles of Anjou, who attained a short reign as King of Sicily 12661282. His ascension as King came to fruition through his involvement in the Eighth Crusade which was financially aided by the Pope, specifically Pope Urban IV as well as his brother King Louis IX, which allowed him to further wield influence over the Italian Guelphs and Papal elections. Although the emergence of the Sicilian Vespers rebellion ended Charles of Anjous reign, it is possible that he may have attained the Piviale during this time and brought it back to Paris and the noble courts. Unfortunately the arrival of the Pivale in Vicenza through the bishop is not documented, thus this missing evidence of its donation and attribution leads scholars to believe in another hypothesis. Some scholars believe that it is more plausible that the Piviale could have been gifted from Federico II to Ezzelino da Romano, as the presence of Federico II in the Veneto region is very well documented, specifically in regards to his connection to Vicenza, as Ezzelinos tyranny is also well known, with the fact that he ruled over Vicenza from 1236 to 1259 with the aid and support of Federico II, demonstrating his strong connection to Ezzelino as a close confidant and ally. In addition, Ezzelino married Federicos daughter, Selvaggia 1238 and it is possible that the mantel was donated to him on this occasion as a matrimonial gift. Following the end of his reign, the liberation of Vicenza 12591260 allowed Bishop Bartolomeo da Breganze to assume his leadership position, placing the Piviale within his jurisdiction, as the textile would have passed from Ezzlinos death to the commune of Vicenza then to the Church of Santa Corona, for which the Bishop had built. Although neither of these theories have physical evidence of the inventory of the piece to support them, it can be said that a connection to King Louis IX, may have facilitated stronger associations and more powerful connections than the tyrannical presence of Ezzelino who was aligned with the party of the Ghibellines, who strongly detested papal influence. Here, the object would have attained even greater value following King Louis IX canonisation as St. Louis 1297 heightening its significance as a contact relic of a sanctified object. King Louis IXs stronger association to his Christian faith provides a stark contrast to Ezzelinos excommunication as a heretic by Pope Innocent IV justifying the reason why the Church of Santa Corona would want to erase their connections with a heretical past and a tyrannical leader. Thus, despite the inability to provide any certainty to this change of history, there is a definite reasoning and motive to change the legend and backdate the gift under the already recorded donation inventory from the King of France.  Provenance  Although there is no explicit scholarly material or records which indicates the exact location and workshop which this textile was made, we can assume that due to the lack of silk workshops following the expulsion of Muslims by Frederick II 1220 and the influx of Christian migration, which led to the deviation of silk to raw material such as cotton and linen, that the Piviale must have been made in one of the largest and remaining textile factories within Sicily, that being Palermos Tiraz Royal Factory.  Restoration  Within the chest of the church of Corona, the director of the Diocesano Museum, Msgr. Francesco Gasparini found a piece from the textile of the Piviale dei Pappagalli, which aided the restoration process as it allowed proper analyses to ensue, one that had not been able to occur before due to the fragility of the piece. As a result, this led to the publication of a volume o",

    "text": "The Akilam one is the first among the seventeen parts of Akilathirattu Ammanai, the religious book of Ayyavazhi. This section includes the Kappu, the first part; it tells of the Detchanam, and describes the political and sociological situation in the early world.  The Kappu  The word, Kappu, in Tamil means the act of the author taking refuge in the Almighty before writing a book. Almost all the ancient works in Tamil begin with Kappu. In this case, however, the Kappu on the one hand functions as an act of the author taking refuge, and on the other hand, reveals the personal liberation of each and every life in the Universe. In this section the author says that, because of the coming of the Kaliyan, God incarnates the Santror to save and rule the universe under One Word, and I am he who heard which God says about that.  Noolcchurikkam  This part provides a summary, in a grand style, of all the events of the Akilam from the beginning of the Universe to the end. It gives a little more information about the Vaikunda Avatharam. This part also includes the spread of God in the mind of the author before writing, and also Adiyeduttharulal the act of giving the first verse of Akilam, by God to the author.  Benefit of the Book  This is the part in which Akilam narrates briefly the benefits of it in a religious way. It says that one who hears its reading will attain Ultimate Completeness, and one who abuses it will be sentenced to Hell.  Novelty of Detchanam  According to Akilathirattu, Santror took birth in this world before the Kali Yukam in Detchanam, and so this Detchanam is the Land of the earliest civilization of Human Beings. In this part, the novelty, sociology, and theology of the civilization were deeply narrated.  Justice of Governance  This part tells about the way in which Chozhan not to be confused with later Cholas, the king of Detchanam, rules his country at an early age, and so suggests the path by which a king should rule his country.  Justice of Divinity  This part tells about the thought of people about the Almighty and about their religious harmony during that age, and tells the way by which one should be divinized.  Justice of Common Man  This part of the book tells us about the moral character of the people, and also their way of life in harmony with nature, particularly women.  Integrity of Castes  This part describes the caste system in the early days. It says that although there were several castes, it was merely a classification; the people of different castes lived as one caste without antipathy.  Neetiya Yukam  The very first yukam which is pronounced yugam in Tamil, and which means aeon was called Neetiya Yukam. During this time, divine, human, and all other virtues flourished without hindrance. The human race lived united as a family, without distinctions of caste, and were not subjected to uliyams pronounced oozhiyam, and meaning slavery or severe labour. They did not fear demons, and there was perfect harmony among the creatures of the Earth, as well as among those who lived in the Fourteen Worlds. In this yukam, the king was righteous and did not oppress his people through taxes or other means. During this peaceful time, Kroni was born. Kroni, who is analogous to Satan in the Christian tradition, is viewed as a primordial personification of evil. Though Kroni is said to have been born with multitudinous limbs, each the size of a mountain, he nevertheless assumes different forms in different yukams: for example, as Ravana or Duroyodhana. In opposition, Vishnu also incarnates in different yukam with different Avatars, for example Rama or Krishna. In order to quell the ravenous hunger in his stomach, Kroni drank all of the waters of the sea. With these waters being insufficient, he swallowed Kailayam, the abode of Sivan Shiva, then proceeded to devour the entire universe. Mayon, residing with Isvaran another name for Shiva in Kailayam, escaped to undertake tavam tapas, meaning austerity to receive permission from Isvaran to destroy Kroni. Isvaran granted this permission, but made Mayon aware of the necessity to appear in different forms in the successive six Yukams in order to destroy the Six Fragments of Kroni. Following this advice, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments, and saved the universe. The first yukam thus came to an end.  Chathura Yukam  According to Ayyavazhi mythology, in the second yukam, called Chathura Yukam, one of the six Pieces of Kroni was formed as a creature called Kuntomasali in the shape and size of a mammoth leech, and when it disturbed the tavam of those in Thavalokam, Mayon destroyed it by catching it in a hook.  Request of Devas  After the two Yukams are completed, Devas requested of Sivan that as they did not find anyone claiming boons in the previous Yukams, so in the following Yukams, the Asuras should be created with the capability of thinking and looking smart, and",

    "text": "The 202021 WHL season was the 55th season of the Western Hockey League WHL. The season began on February 26 and ended on May 12. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a late start, the season was shortened from 68 to 24 games, and the WHL officially termed the season as a developmental season. Teams played within their respective divisions only: the Central Division consisted exclusively of Alberta-based teams, the U.S. Division played exclusively in Washington state, all B.C.-based teams played from either Sandman Centre or Prospera Place in Kamloops and Kelowna, British Columbia, and all East Division games were played at Brandt Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan. In Alberta due to protocols agreed upon by the league, a five-day period was required between games involving different opponents. Therefore, all Central Division games were scheduled as home-and-home series on weekends only, and thus no team was scheduled to play more than one opponent per-week. On April 19, citing logistical issues and interprovincial travel restrictions, and following the cancellation of the 2021 Memorial Cup, the WHL announced that it had cancelled the playoffs. Therefore, no league champion was declared for the second season in a row.

    "text": "The morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor drama. The term is used by scholars of literary and dramatic history to refer to a genre of play texts from the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries that feature personified concepts most often virtues and vices, but sometimes practices or habits alongside angels and demons, who are engaged in a struggle to persuade a protagonist who represents a generic human character toward either good or evil. The common story arc of these plays follows the temptation, fall and redemption of the protagonist.  English morality plays  Hildegard von Bingens Ordo Virtutum English: Order of the Virtues, composed c. 1151 in Germany, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and it is the only medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music. Because there are many formal differences between this play and later medieval moralities, as well as the fact that it only exists in two manuscripts, it is unlikely that the Ordo Virtutum had any direct influence on the writing of its later English counterparts. Traditionally, scholars name only five surviving English morality plays from the medieval period: The Pride of Life late 14th century, The Castle of Perseverance c.1425; Wisdom, 146063; Mankind c.1470; Everyman 1510. The Pride of Life was the earliest record of a morality play written in the English language; the text destroyed by fire in 1922, but published earlier existed on the back of a parchment account roll from June 30, 1343, to January 5, 1344, from the Priory of the Holy Trinity in Dublin. However, this textual record was incomplete. The play cut off mid-line, when the character Messenger, at the command of the King, called upon Death; the plot summary provided by the introductory banns, featured at the beginning of the play, indicated that the action continued. The Castle of Perseverance, Wisdom, and Mankind are all part of a single manuscript called the Macro Manuscript, named after its first known owner, Cox Macro of Bury St Edmunds. A second copy of the first 752 lines of Wisdom is preserved in MS Digby 133. It is possible that the Macro version was copied from the Digby manuscript, but there is also the possibility that both were copied from elsewhere. Unlike The Pride of Life and the Macro plays, all of which survive only in manuscript form, Everyman exists as a printed text, in four different sources. Two of these four sources were printed by Pynson and two were printed by John Skot. Pamela King notes how Everymans status as a printed text pushes the boundaries of the medieval morality genre; she writes, It was also one of the very first plays to be printed, and in some respects belongs more to the early Tudor tradition than that of the late Middle Ages. Other English moralities include the fifteenth-century plays Occupation  Idleness and Henry Medwalls Nature, as well as an array of sixteenth-century works like The World and the Child and John Skeltons Magnificence. Additionally, there are other sixteenth-century plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays as outlined above, such as Hickscorner, but they are not generally categorized as such. The characters in Hickscorner are personified vices and virtues: Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. The French medieval morality play tradition is also quite rich: for an explanation of French medieval morality plays, visit the French Wikipedia page.  History of the term morality play  While scholars refer to these works as morality plays, the play texts do not refer to themselves as such; rather, the genre and its nomenclature have been retroactively conceived by scholarship as a way for modern scholars to understand a series of texts that share enough commonalities that they may be better understood together. Thus, as scholar Pamela King has noted, the morality plays absolute cohesion as a group is bound to be questioned in any attempt to define that form in its individual manifestations and theatrical contexts. As for the history of the term itself in modern usage, premodern plays were separated into moralities and mysteries by Robert Dodsley in the 18th century; he categorized moralities as allegorical plays and mysteries as biblical plays, though nothing suggests that the moralities are not biblical or would not conceive of themselves as such. Although they do not explicitly label themselves with the genre title morality plays, some of the play texts self-reflexively refer to themselves with the term game. While the Middle English spelling of game varies, the noun generally refers to a joy, festivity, amusement, or play. In the opening lines of The Pride of Life, the Prolocutor uses the word game when asking his audience to listen attentively, stating, Lordinges and ladiis that beth hende, Herkenith al with mylde mode How oure gam schal gyn and",

Work  Stepan Ryabchenko uses a broad range of computer software and digital technologies to create large-scale digital prints, animations, sculptures, light installations, and videos representing his own digital universe, populated with fictional characters, surrealistic plant and animal forms, and visualizations of computer viruses. His futuristic visual language, which moves between abstract and figurative forms, explores our relationship to virtual spaces and the natural environment.  About the Artist  The work of Odessa artist Stepan Ryabchenko belongs to those phenomena that shape the space of contemporary Ukrainian art and determine its scope and intentions. The aesthetics of new media art, the field in which the artist works, not only open up new dimensions of creativity but also require special qualities from the artist: imagination, a sense of space, and those metamorphoses of the image that reveal and visualize strange connections between the real and the virtual, the real and the fictional. It is no coincidence that one of the topics that fascinates the artist is new nature, where myths and fictions intersect with impressions of the surrounding world and other, unexpected projections of it. Galyna Sklyarenko, art historian, curator Stepan Ryabchenko uses computer graphics for a body of work balancing between the digital format and physical forms. He deals with contemporary heroism and classical mythology. He creates large-size digital prints representing a self-constructed universe featuring monumental heroes in brightly coloured compositions that combine figurative and abstract futuristic language. In another work group, he researches digital anti-heroism by developing a physical representation for the purely digital form of a virus  the face of a computer virus.

    "text": "Norwich Bus Station is sited off Surrey Street and Queens Road, in Norwich, Norfolk, England. It is served by several bus operators, including First Eastern Counties, Konectbus, National Express, Megabus and Sanders Coaches.  History  The land between Surrey Street and Bull Lane was acquired in April 1934 by the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company. The huge garage and station were designed by architect H J Starkey and it was opened in 1936 by the Lord Mayor Walter Riley. The garage had the biggest unsupported roof span in the country, with no pillars or supports in the 52,000 sq ft of floor space. The garage structure was said to have weighed 220 tonnes; 650,000 bricks and nine miles of electric cable went into its construction. The Norwich PT Major transportation project identified the need for a new bus station as the catalyst for the regeneration of an important social and commercial area of Norwich which was previously neglected. Funding was awarded in November 2002 and planning consent was granted in December 2003.

    "text": "Michael Rolf Kunze born 9 November 1943, in Prague is a foremost German musical theater lyricist and librettist. He is best known for the hit musicals Elisabeth 1992, Tanz der Vampire 1996, Mozart! 1999, Marie Antoinette 2006, and Rebecca 2006. He has also written the lyrics for a number of hit songs under the pseudonym Stephan Prager, including the number one Billboard hit Fly, Robin, Fly 1976, and was one of the top 1970s record producers, producing songs for musical acts Silver Convention, Penny McLean, and Sister Sledge. Kunze has won a Grammy Award, ECHO Lifetime Award and holds 79 Gold and Platinum records.  Early life  Born in Prague, Kunze is the son of actress Dita Roesler and Walter Kunze, a writer, cartoonist and journalist, who worked for the German language newspaper Prager Tagblatt. He grew up in Southern Germany and attended Klenze Oberrealschule in Munich. He studied law, philosophy and history at LMU Munich.  Early career  Kunze started writing music and lyrics during his high school years in the early sixties. The Hamburg folklore group, City Preachers, recorded an LP with some of those early songs. The record was anything but a commercial success, but it made the music business aware of Michael Kunze. The first song Kunze produced with Peter Maffay, a 20-year-old newcomer, was called Du English Translation: You. It topped the German charts in the summer of 1970 and went gold. Working with Peter Maffay, Kunze co-wrote the song Ich bin wie du for Elke Best. Backed with Die Spiele der großen Leute the recording was produced by Fritz Muschler and released on EMI Electrola 006-30 462 in 1973. His recordings would dominate the 1970s music charts in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. When he produced his first international act, he hit both the top of the Billboard and Cashbox charts in the U.S. with the song, Fly, Robin, Fly. His group, Silver Convention, represented by composer Sylvester Levay and Michael Kunze himself, influenced disco music and was the first German aggregation ever to win the coveted Grammy Award. Based on his success in the U.S.  after Fly, Robin, Fly came such hits as Lady Bump and Get up and Boogie  Michael produced albums with a vast and varied array of internationally known performers, including Julio Iglesias, Nana Mouskouri, Herbie Mann, Lulu, Gilbert Bécaud, Sister Sledge and Caterina Valente. In 1981, Kunze stopped working as a producer but continued to write lyrics for top artists. Taking a temporary hiatus from show business, he wrote the book Highroad to the Stake: A Tale of Witchcraft German Title: Strasse ins Feuer. It was translated into several languages; The New York Times called it a vivid story of a witch. He wrote a second book, Give Way To Freedom German Title: Der Freiheit eine Gasse on the 1848 democratic revolution in Southern Germany.  Later career  In the 1980s, the musical began making its way into the center of Kunzes activities. First, he adapted Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical Evita, which was the beginning of his collaboration and friendship with the legendary Broadway director, Harold Prince. The success of his adaptation opened the doors of the German-speaking market for the modern Anglo-American musical and made him the preferred translator for international hit shows. His German version of Cats ran for seven years in Vienna, making it one of the greatest hits of all times in that city. The numerous other musicals Kunze has translated into German include The Phantom of the Opera, A Chorus Line, Song and Dance, Into the Woods, Follies, Assassins, Side by Side by Sondheim, Dorian Gray, Little Shop of Horrors, Aspects of Love, Sunset Boulevard, Kiss of the Spider Woman, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Lion King, Mamma Mia! and Elton Johns Aida. Kunze also started working for television. He conceived and wrote several, 90-minute shows for the major German and Austrian networks Liebe ist ...ZDF, Sport GalaARD, Weil wir leben wollen ZDF and developed the ARD Series Showgeschichten. In 1991, he conceived the international Peter Ustinov Gala in Paris, celebrating Sir Peter Ustinovs 70th birthday, starring Sir Yehudin Menuhin, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Petula Clark, Tony Curtis and Montserrat Caballé. With the annual Bambi Award Gala, he created the German counterpart to the American Academy Award presentation. His once-a-year special, Die Peter-Alexander-Show, starring Germanys top musical entertainer, Peter Alexander, and, among others, Richard Chamberlain, Joan Collins and Liza Minnelli ORF reached cult status in the 1990s. He also conceived Der Goldene Löwe, the German counterpart to the American Emmy Awards show. Over the years, he has also written a number of articles for German magazines and newspapers Stern, Frankfurter Allgemeine, ZEITMagazin, Playboy, Süddeutsche Zeitung, exploring his views on the function of entertainment in society and current media issues.

    "text": "Barristers in England and Wales are one of the two main categories of lawyer in England and Wales, the other being solicitors. Barristers have traditionally had the role of handling cases for representation in court, both defence and prosecution. They are highly-trained legal advisers and courtroom advocates and appear in court when instructed by a solicitor. Strict rules are in place about what a barrister must do for the court, their client and how they must behave. The word lawyer is a generic term, referring to a person who practises in law, which could also be deemed to include other legal practitioners such as chartered legal executives.  Origin of the profession  The work of senior legal professionals in England and Wales is divided between solicitors and barristers. Both are trained in law but serve differing functions in the practice of law. Historically, the superior courts were based in London, the capital city. To dispense justice throughout the country, a judge and court personnel would periodically travel a regional circuit to deal with cases that had arisen there. From this developed a body of lawyers who were socially familiar with the judges, had training and experience in the superior courts, and had access to a greater corpus of research material and accumulated knowledge on the interpretation and application of the law. Some would go on circuit with the court to act on behalf of those requiring representation. By contrast, solicitors were essentially local to one place, whether London or a provincial town. Lawyers who practised in the courts in this way came to be called barristers because they were called to the Bar, the symbolic barrier separating the publicincluding solicitors and law studentsfrom those admitted to the well of the Court. They became specialists either in court to represent clients, or in giving oral or written advice on the strength of a case and the best way to conduct it. For those who had the means and preference to engage a solicitor, it became useful, then normal and then compulsory, for the solicitor, in turn, to select and engage a barrister to represent the client before the courts. Likewise, it became either useful or normal but not compulsory to engage an appropriate barrister when highly specialist advice was required. Many barristers have largely paper practices and rarely or never appear in court. Historically, practising at the bar or in court was a more socially prestigious profession than working as a solicitor. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the bar was one of the limited number of professions considered suitable for upper-class men; politics, the Army and Navy, the established clergy, banking and the civil and diplomatic services being the others. Many leading 18th- and 19th-century politicians were barristers; few were solicitors. In the 20th century, solicitors narrowed the gap greatly, especially in terms of earnings, and by the early 21st century the social gap was far less important.  Key differences from the profession of solicitor  Until recently, the most obvious differences between the two professions were: Only barristers had exclusive and wide rights of audience that is, a right to plead in all courts in England and Wales; Only solicitors could be directly engaged by clients for payment. These differences have been eroded by recent deliberate changes, although in many fields of legal practice, the distinction is largely retained. Barristers have full rights of audience to appear in all courts, from highest to lowest. Solicitors, on the other hand, have traditionally been able to appear only as advocates in the lower courts that is, the magistrates and county courts and tribunals. The bulk of such work continues to be handled by solicitors. Under section 17 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, solicitors with appropriate advocacy experience are entitled to acquire higher rights of audience, enabling them to appear in the superior courts. Solicitors who attain these rights are known as solicitor-advocates. But, in practice, there are rather few of these solicitor-advocates, and solicitors often continue to engage a barrister to undertake any required advocacy in court. Not only is this division traditional; in higher-value civil or more serious criminal cases, it is often tactically imperative to engage a specialist advocate because if one side does not the other might. Until 2004, barristers were prohibited from seeking or accepting instructions that is, being hired directly by the clients whom they represent. The involvement of a solicitor was compulsory. The rationale was that solicitors could investigate and gather evidence and instructions and filter them  according to the interests of the client  before presenting them to the barrister; in return the barrister, being one step removed from the client, could reach a more objective opinion of the merits of the case, working strictly from",

    "text": "The Left Column German: Kolonne Links was an agitprop theater troupe during the 1920s and 1930s. The troupe worked in support of the Workers International Relief WIR. During the Nazi era, some of the group went into exile in the Soviet Union, where some of the members were arrested by the Soviet secret police in the Great Purge and in connection with the Hitler Youth Conspiracy.  History  In its early years, the group consisted of nine people, none of whom had any theatrical training, a pianist and a driver. The Berlin troupe was one of the most highly praised agitprop troupes in Germany, despite its lack of training. Hans Hauska joined the troupe in late summer 1930. In 1931, the Left Column were rewarded with a tour in the Soviet Union for five weeks for having gained 16,000 new members for the WIR. On their return, they discovered that several of their performances in Germany were cancelled because a March 28, 1931 decree from the Reichspräsident to combat violence led to a local prohibition against agitprop theater assemblies. Six members then left Germany, embarking on a 4-month trip by boat and train across Siberia back to Moscow. In 1933, under Gustav von Wangenheims leadership, they established the German Left Column Theater with members of Troupe 31, another agitprop theater group. In 1935, troupe members Helmut Damerius and Bruno Schmidtsdorf, were in Wangenheims 1935 anti-Nazi film, Kämpfer. Schmidtsdorf played the lead role, Fritz Lemke, and Hauska wrote the music. Beginning in 1935, the NKVD began arresting members of the troupe in the Great Purge. All those arrested were members who had arrived in Moscow after 1932. Arrested members included Hans Hauska on November 20, 1937. On February 5, 1938, Kurt Ahrendt, Karl Oefelein and Schmidtsdorf were arrested, charged with starting a branch of the Hitler Youth, and were executed three weeks later. On March 17, 1938, Helmut Damerius, once a leader of the troupe, was arrested and sent to a gulag in Siberia. His sentence ended in 1946, after which he was exiled to Kazakhstan and forced to remain another eight years. Hauska, after four years in custody, and sentenced in a Nazi court on August 18, 1939 to one and a half years at hard labor in a Zuchthaus, was returned to the Nazis on December 5, 1940 under the MolotovRibbentrop Pact. Other arrested members were Hans Klering; Max Mielke, who arrived in Moscow in 1932, was arrested in 1938 and never heard from again; Albert Wolff; and Max Samuel Katzenellenbogen, a former member of the troupe in Berlin, who fled to Moscow after having been arrested by the Gestapo. He was arrested by the NKVD in 1937 and never heard from again. Damerius survived his imprisonment, as did Klering, who returned to Germany in 1946 and became a co-founder of DEFA. Damerius was unable to leave the Soviet Union until 1956.

Nicknamed Shii by Kaname, he is one of the three survivors of the destruction of Ōtsuka Village. He holds the living sword Murasame in his right arm, along with a peony birthmark. Because of a curse set by harboring Murasame within his body, he is still in his 13-year-old state. Five years before the start of the story, Shino was a very weak and ill child who was made to dress and act like a girl by his parents because they heard doing so would help him grow. Young Shino was told that he would not live into adulthood. He still openly welcomed Sosuke and Hamaji into his home and treated the two abandoned children as brother and sister. Shino even commented that he and Sosuke are brothers when he sees Sosukes peony mark. Though mentally 18, he does tend to act like his status age, something Sosuke is constantly teasing and lecturing him about. He often has outbursts of emotion, is very energetic and loud yet has a very kind, naïve, and loving nature. Because of this many people are attracted to him, including spirits and humans. He easily makes friends with many people, is usually straight forward, talking or taking action without thinking, which typically concludes with a scolding from Sosuke. He seems quite perplexed by the fact that Genpachi has shown a romantic interest in him, again pointing to his age and naivety. He cares deeply for those around him, to such an extent that he forced Sosuke to continue living after they were fatally injured five years ago. Although his exterior personality is happy and optimistic, he reveals himself to be quite burdened and knowledgeable of the events taking place around him; this is often seen when his thoughts travel to his immortality. He is shown to have a deep fear of the possibility of living alone one day. Shino loves meat, and he is petrified of the living dead and insects, and is usually seen running away or clinging to Sosuke in fear when either appear. Despite his phobias, when he needs to fight he shows great bravery and is calmer, especially with Murasame in hand. Shino often wears a red and white long coat with the church insignia on the back and has short purple hair and greenish yellow eyes. He is revealed to be the younger half brother of Satomi Rio. Sōsuke Inukawa 犬川 荘介 Voiced by: Satoshi Hino Japanese; Leraldo Anzaldua English The holder of the Duty 義 bead. He is another of the three survivors, along with Shino and Hamaji. He can shape shift into the dog Yoshiro, who had been Shinos loyal pet, and has a peony mark on the back of his neck. He treats Shino and Hamaji like family, as he does not have any relatives. He is very strict on safety and tends to be the calm and composed one to Shinos brash and compulsive behavior. He is also very protective of Shino and often volunteers to pay the prices for his deeds, as seen when he was willing to pay the price of having his arm cut off in order to protect Shino when he trespassed into Chikages house. He is constantly by Shinos side and tends to spend half his time bailing him out of trouble. A mysterious man who looks identical to him, Ao who was referred to as Sosukes shadow by Murasame is said to be the other half of Sosukes soul. He has a very kind and gentle person",

It is located in the Maiella National Park in a valley enclosed by the western slopes of the Majella massif, and the northeastern slopes of the Morrone group.  History  Originally the town of SantEufemia was known as Santa Femi. In the 14th century the town was renamed Santa Fumia and retained that name until 1863 when, by decree of King Victor Emmanuel II, it was named SantEufemia a Maiella. Until the 11th century SantEufemia a Maiella was part of the Caramanico Terme. Then, in 1064, Count Berardo gave the church of SantEufemia and surrounding land at Caramanico to the Abbey of San Clemente a Casauria which retained possession of the town until 1145. In 1145, the area became the possession of Boemondo, who was the Count of Manoppello at the time. Eventually, in 1301 ownership was passed on to the Ughelli family and then to Giacomo Arcucci, the Count of Minervino. Upon the death of Giacomo Arcucci in 1389, it became the property of the DAquino family.  Main sights  Giardino Botanico Daniela Brescia  Climate   References",

Production  The design was initially built by Gulf Marine Products starting in 1965 and later by Capital Yachts in Harbor City, California, United States. It was produced until 1990, with 400 boats completed, but it is now out of production.  Design  The Gulf 32 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It is a cutter riged sloop, with a raked stem, an angled transom, a keel-hung rudder controlled by two wheels, one on the aft cockpit and one in the pilot house. It has a fixed long keel or an optional shoal draft keel. It displaces 16,000 lb 7,257 kg and carries 6,500 lb 2,948 kg of ballast. The boat has a draft of 5.17 ft 1.58 m with the standard keel and 4.5 ft 1.4 m with the optional shoal draft keel. The boat is fitted with a Universal 40 36 hp 27 kW diesel engine for docking and maneuvering. The design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a truncated double V-berth in the bow cabin, an L-shaped settee and a straight settee in the main cabin and an aft cabin with a quarter berth on the starboard side. The galley is located on the port side of the wheelhouse. The galley is U-shaped and is equipped with a three-burner stove, ice box and a double sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side. The design has a hull speed of 6.47 kn 11.98 kmh.  Operational history  In a 2016 article in Cruising World magazine, Ken Painter wrote, nine years ago I decided to take the leap from trailer-sailer to smaller ocean cruiser, and went looking for an affordable, seaworthy and comfortable sailboat capable of exploring the Pacific Northwest and maybe, someday, sailing around the world. When I first viewed Mariah, a 1978 Gulf Pilothouse 32 Id found on Craigslist, I was struck by her lines, her interior volume and the flush deck ... Mariah proved herself reliable and comfortable throughout an eight-month cruise from Seattle to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and back to San Diego in 2012 and 2013. I still get regular compliments on her design.  See also  List of sailing boat types  References",

    "text": "We Russian: Мы, romanized: My is a dystopian novel by Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin often anglicised as Eugene Zamiatin that was written in 19201921. It was first published as an English translation by Gregory Zilboorg in 1924 by E. P. Dutton in New York. The original Russian text was first published in 1952; the novel was not published in Soviet Russia until 1988. The novel describes a world of harmony and conformity within a united totalitarian state, against which the protagonist, D-503 Russian: Д-503, rebels. The book is considered a literary masterpiece as well as one of the greatest and most influential works of the 20th century. It influenced the emergence of dystopia as a literary genre. George Orwell said that Aldous Huxleys 1931 Brave New World must be partly derived from We, although Huxley denied this. Orwells own Nineteen Eighty-Four 1949 and Animal Farm were also inspired by We, as are many other contemporary dystopian novels.  Setting  We is set in the far future. D-503, a spacecraft engineer, lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass presumably to assist with mass surveillance. The structure of the state is Panopticon-like, and life is based upon Frederick Winslow Taylors principles of scientific management. Society is run centrally by a power known as the Benefactor, and is run according to a strict timetablepeople march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by their given designations referred to as numbers in the novel. The society in which We is set uses mathematical logic and reason for its scheduling and as justification for its actions. The individuals behaviour is based on logic by way of formulae and equations outlined by the One State.  Plot  A few hundred years after the One States conquest of the entire world, the spaceship INTEGRAL is being built in order to invade and conquer extraterrestrial planets. The projects chief engineer, D-503, begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship. The book is this journalit titles chapters as nth Entry and begins each entry with three lines of notes summarising the events therein. Like all other citizens of the One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by the secret police, or Bureau of Guardians. D-503s lover, O-90, has been assigned to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by that status. O-90s other lover and D-503s best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions. While on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are illegal by the laws of the One State. Repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House, notable for being the only opaque building in the One State, except for the windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians but finds that he cannot. D-503 begins to have dreams, which disturb him, as dreams are thought to be a symptom of mental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is involved with the Mephi, an organisation plotting to bring down the One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world: humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of the One State with the outside world. Despite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503 obliges. During the pregnancy, O-90 realises that she cannot bear to be parted from her baby. At D-503s request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the Green Wall. In his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the Great Operation, which has recently been mandated for all citizens of the One State to prevent possible riots; having been psycho-surgically refashioned into a state of mechanical reliability, they would now function as tractors in human form. This operation removes the imagination and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor, the dictator of the One State, about the inner workings of the Mephi. I-330 is then brought to an interrogation chamber",

It is the fourth series of the RDF Media programme, Shipwrecked, and featured a radically different format from the first three series, in that contestants were divided into tribes, with competitions, voting and a cash prize at stake.  Tribes  Note 1 : James George originally joined Tigers in Week 6, but nominated to Sharks in Week 8 after being found out as a Shark mole by the Tigers. Note 2 : Jo Armstrong is the sister of departed castaway Geoff Armstrong. Jo originally introduced herself as Lorna in her week as new arrival to hide her relationship to Geoff. Note 3 : Chris Baddoo made a shock nomination to Sharks in Week 11, but nominated back to Tigers in Week 13 using up his two island moves. Note 4 : Kevin had nominated to Tigers in Week 13, but was rejected as the Tigers favoured the returning Chris Baddoo. Kevin successfully nominated to Tigers in Week 14. As a punishment for the kidnapping of Anna Singleton in Week 16, the Tigers nominated Kevin to go back to the Sharks as a punishment, Kevin had always planned on nominating back to the Sharks anyway. Note 5 : Gareth nominated to Sharks after an unhappy week on Tigers in Week 14. Note 6 : Courtney nominated to Sharks in Week 15, after not settling on Tiger Island. Note 7 : John volunteered to serve the Sharks punishment for setting foot on Tiger Island during the Anna Singleton fiasco.  Castaways that departed   The Kidnapping of Anna Singleton  During the sixteenth week in the competition, both tribes were asked to select a member of the opposing side to stay for one night, in a game where numbers are vital this was an ideal opportunity to claim back former members who had switched. The Shark Tribe ask for Katie who is a founding member of the Tigers and is heavily inclined towards them. When the Tigers ask for Anna the Sharks are wary of their strategy and eagerly await the return of their tribe member. After a night of enjoyment on Tigers Anna becomes close to Chris Brain, the Tigers agree to kidnap Anna for a bit of fun and send a ransom note to the Sharks. though when they originally voice the idea you can hear Anna agree to it due. Enraged by the demands, the Sharks endure the 12-mile swim and demand the return of their tribe mate who is hiding in the jungle with Chris Brain, Shipwrecked rules dictate that an opposing tribe cannot stand on the opposing island unless invited or if it is a Sunday generally known as a Beach Party where the new castaway decide their tribe. The Sharks violate this rule by raiding the camp and in doing so taking Kevin with them, thus breaking another rule by unofficially joining an island without nomination. At the Beach Party in which Ryan chose his tribe eventually, Tigers they were informed that they would be punished for their actions, and that each tribe must sacrifice one of their own to move permanently. Tiger Island accepted Kevins wish to return, meanwhile Shark Islands John Melvin volunteered to move. When Kevin and John swapped necklaces  they were reminded that this was non-negotiable. And they would never bear their old tribes necklace, much to the dismay of Sharks.  References   External links",

Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 SAM2 can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt L2RP, a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barretts dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.",

This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object for standardization and encoding, and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50 in our setting.

    "text": "Federated Learning FL has emerged as a key paradigm for building Trustworthy AI systems by enabling privacy-preserving, decentralized model training. However, FL is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise model integrity and data confidentiality, a vulnerability exacerbated by the fact that conventional data inspection methods are incompatible with its decentralized design. While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain RFC, a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation on image classification tasks under various adversarial scenarios, demonstrates that RFC significantly improves robustness compared to baseline methods, providing a viable solution for securing decentralized learning environments.",

We introduce StoryMovie, a dataset of 1,757 stories aligned with movie scripts and subtitles through LCS matching. Our alignment pipeline synchronizes screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps, enabling dialogue attribution by linking character names from scripts to temporal positions from subtitles. Using this aligned content, we generate stories that maintain visual grounding tags while incorporating authentic character names, dialogue, and relationship dynamics. We fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on this dataset, building on prior work in visual grounding and entity re-identification. Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9 win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment. Compared to Storyteller, trained without script grounding, Storyteller3 achieves 48.5 versus 38.0, confirming that semantic alignment progressively improves dialogue attribution beyond visual grounding alone.",

While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: i inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; ii poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.",

Notably, we identify a phenomenon of structural confusion in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, rescuing these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings.

Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal avoiding performance degradation, and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods.

Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module ETM that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.",

Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion. A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space.

Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model LLM agent and a reinforcement learning RL agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer OLTC and shunt capacitors SCs to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents.

However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA SC-VLA, which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16 fewer steps and a 9 higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14 gain in real-world experiments.

    "text": "Deep intracranial tumors situated in eloquent brain regions controlling vital functions present critical diagnostic challenges. Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making. The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90 accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20.",

We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agents functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass1 over the vanilla agent by 4.7 pp on average e.g., 6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function.

This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agents output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion.

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: 1 Structured Speckle Amplification Attack SSAA, which injects boundary-targeted noise, and 2 Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack FDUA, which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient DSC of 0.76 SD 0.20 on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 SD 0.20 while maintaining high visual similarity SSIM  0.94. FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 SD 0.09 with lower visual fidelity SSIM  0.82.

The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley Crank--Nicolson discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension N solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of ΩN2 for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the N-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections.

    "text": "Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions CBFs, we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program QP at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the models learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100 constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.",

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of ε-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.",

We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty ACE. ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i  logpi_thetay_ix  pi_refy_ix, to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACEs gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizers strength.

This shift selects for a specific organizational equilibrium -- the Headless Firm -- structured as an hourglass: a personalized generative interface at the top, a standardized protocol waist in the middle, and a competitive market of micro-specialized execution agents at the bottom. We formalize this claim as a coordination cost model with two falsifiable empirical predictions: 1 the marginal cost of adding an execution provider should be approximately constant in a mature hourglass ecosystem; 2 the ratio of total coordination cost to task throughput should remain stable as ecosystem size grows. We derive conditions for hourglass stability versus re-centralization and analyze implications for firm size distributions, labor markets, and software economics.

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results. Our code is available at",

Under the additive noise model Y  fX  varepsilon with varepsilon perp X and f nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward causal direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 2630 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 3030 on sine and exponential data-generating processes.

The two main problems we are interested in are the emphOptimal Decision Tree and emphSet Cover. We study these two fundamental tasks under precedence constraints, that is, if a test or set X is a predecessor of Y, then in any feasible decision tree X needs to be an ancestor of Y or respectively, if Y is added to set cover, then so must be X. For the Optimal Decision Tree we consider two optimization criteria: worst case identification time height of the tree or the average identification time. Similarly, for the Set Cover we study two cost measures: the size of the cover or the average cover time. Our approach is to develop a number of algorithmic reductions, where an approximation algorithm for one problem provides an approximation for another via a black-box usage of a procedure for the former. En route we introduce other optimization problems either to complete the reduction landscape or because they hold the essence of combinatorial structure of our problems. The latter is brought by a problem of finding a maximum density precedence closed subfamily, where the density is defined as the ratio of the number of items the family covers to its size. By doing so we provide cOsqrtm-approximation algorithms for all of the aforementioned problems. The picture is complemented by a number of hardness reductions that provide om112-ε-inapproximability results for the decision tree and covering problems. Besides giving a complete set of results for general precedence constraints, we also provide polylogarithmic approximation guarantees for two most typically studied and applicable precedence types, outforests and inforests.

Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form.

The best known upper bound for this problem relies on L_1-polynomial regression and has complexity dtildeO1σ2 log1ε, where σ is the smoothing parameter and ε is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query SQ lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that even for Gaussian marginals any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity dΩ1σ2log1ε. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying L_1-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function which turns out to be the same condition required for the L_1-polynomial regression to work. Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces.",

We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when passk policy optimization can reduce pass1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that passk policy gradients can conflict with pass1 gradients because passk optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the passk update direction away from the pass1 direction.

Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent SGD - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space.

However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research.",

When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task.

If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true but unknown distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT  Ominmaxeta, 1  sqrtb, b log b, where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and eta is the Earth Movers Wasserstein-1 distance between p and p-hat.

Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know or have any bound on the prediction error eta, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.

In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients. External heterogeneity refers to the data distribution discrepancy across different clients, while internal heterogeneity represents the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data within clients. Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server external and  or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client internal. But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels.

The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch.

We argue that additive positional embeddings make the attention mechanism only superficially sensitive to sequence order: positional information is entangled with item embedding semantics, propagates weakly in deep architectures, and limits the ability to capture rich sequential patterns. To address these limitations, we introduce a kernelized self-attention mechanism, where a learnable positional kernel operates purely in the position space, disentangled from semantic similarity, and directly modulates attention weights. When applied per attention block, this kernel enables adaptive multi-scale sequential modeling. Experiments on standard next-item prediction benchmarks show that our positional kernel attention consistently improves over strong competing baselines.",

Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the Ωn1d regime of Wu et al. 2023 and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke 2021 or Wu et al. 2023.

    "text": "Several variations of adaptive first-order and second-order optimization methods have been proposed to accelerate and scale the training of large language models. The performance of these optimization routines is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters HPs, which are computationally expensive to tune for large-scale models. Maximal update parameterization μP is a set of scaling rules which aims to make the optimal HPs independent of the model size, thereby allowing the HPs tuned on a smaller computationally cheaper model to be transferred to train a larger, target model. Despite promising results for SGD and Adam, deriving μP for other optimizers is challenging because the underlying tensor programming approach is difficult to grasp. Building on recent work that introduced spectral conditions as an alternative to tensor programs, we propose a novel framework to derive μP for a broader class of optimizers, including AdamW, ADOPT, LAMB, Sophia, Shampoo and Muon. We implement our μP derivations on multiple benchmark models and demonstrate zero-shot learning rate transfer across increasing model width for the above optimizers. Further, we provide empirical insights into depth-scaling parameterization for these optimizers.",

Prior studies have explored EEG-based classification of objects or concepts, often for passive viewing of briefly presented image or video stimuli, with limited classes. Because EEG exhibits a low signal-to-noise ratio, recognizing fine-grained representations across a large number of classes remains challenging; however, abstract-level object representations may exist. In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning ML model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks episodes. Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising 931538 EEG samples under 1610 object labels, acquired from 264 human participants subjects performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring. We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction.",

To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest SAEF, a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is.

We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens e.g., wait. Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only 2.4 of adapter features 5.6k total performing one of two functions.

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2pi_k of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition v, 1  0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional Jv  g, v - mu  2 v2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v  -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2pi_k to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.",

In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control RGSC, which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agents evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions.

By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training.

In contrast, biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces i.e., engrams strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we introduce the Engram Neural Network ENN, a novel recurrent architecture incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep learning models.",

In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the models inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content.

Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users PRU and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items PRI, while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics.

It achieves this by summarising the treated response conditional on both the covariates and the untreated response.

Architecturally, DNNs rely on the recursive application of parametrized functions, a mechanism that can be unstable and difficult to train, making stability a primary concern. Even when training succeeds, there are few rigorous results on how well such models generalize beyond the observed data, especially in the generative setting. In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems IFS and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to i establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and ii derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator. We illustrate the theory on a controlled 2D example and empirically evaluate the proposed objective on standard image datasets MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10.",

To aid such decisions, we propose a diagnostic tool for contrasting global regression models and patient-specific local regression models. The core utility of this tool is to identify where and for whom a global model may be inadequate. We focus on regression models and specifically suggest a localized regression approach that identifies regions in the predictor space where patients are not well represented by the global model. As localization becomes challenging when dealing with many predictors, we propose modeling in a dimension-reduced latent representation obtained from an autoencoder. Using such a neural network architecture for dimension reduction enables learning a latent representation simultaneously optimized for both good data reconstruction and for revealing local outcome-related associations suitable for robust localized regression. We illustrate the proposed approach with a clinical study involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings indicate that the global model is adequate for most patients but that indeed specific subgroups benefit from personalized models. We also demonstrate how to map these subgroup models back to the original predictors, providing insight into why the global model falls short for these groups.

We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a χ2 divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all.

Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow DC-OPF simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that cherry-picks a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data.

Traditional boosting algorithms, designed for fully observed random samples, often struggle with real-world problems, particularly with interval-censored data. This type of data is common in survival analysis and time-to-event studies where exact event times are unobserved but fall within known intervals. Effective handling of such data is crucial in fields like medical research, reliability engineering, and social sciences. In this work, we introduce novel nonparametric boosting methods for regression and classification tasks with interval-censored data. Our approaches leverage censoring unbiased transformations to adjust loss functions and impute transformed responses while maintaining model accuracy. Implemented via functional gradient descent, these methods ensure scalability and adaptability. We rigorously establish their theoretical properties, including optimality and mean squared error trade-offs. Our proposed methods not only offer a robust framework for enhancing predictive accuracy in domains where interval-censored data are common but also complement existing work, expanding the applicability of existing boosting techniques.

For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure.

In many modern applications, auxiliary covariates are collected alongside responses and encode information about the same latent structure. Traditional approaches to incorporating such covariates typically rely on fully specified joint likelihoods, which are computationally intensive and sensitive to misspecification. We introduce a covariate-assisted grade of membership model that integrates response and covariate information by exploiting their shared low-rank simplex geometry, rather than modeling their joint distribution. We propose a likelihood-free spectral estimation procedure that combines heterogeneous data sources through a balance parameter controlling their relative contribution. To accommodate high-dimensional and heteroskedastic noise, we employ heteroskedastic principal component analysis before performing simplex-based geometric recovery. Our theoretical analysis establishes weaker identifiability conditions than those required in the covariate-free model, and further derives finite-sample, entrywise error bounds for both mixed membership scores and item parameters. These results demonstrate that auxiliary covariates can provably improve latent structure recovery, yielding faster convergence rates in high-dimensional regimes.

This paper presents a unified and complete Kantorovich duality theory for MOT problem on general Polish product spaces with bounded continuous cost function. For marginal compact spaces, the duality identity is derived through a convex-analytic reformulation, that identifies the dual problem as a Fenchel-Rockafellar conjugate. We obtain dual attainment and show that optimal potentials may always be chosen in the class of c-conjugate families, thereby extending classical two-marginal conjugacy principle into a genuinely multimarginal setting. In non-compact setting, where direct compactness arguments are unavailable, we recover duality via a truncation-tightness procedure based on weak compactness of multimarginal transference plans and boundedness of the cost. We prove that the dual value is preserved under restriction to compact subsets and that admissible dual families can be regularized into uniformly bounded c-conjugate potentials. The argument relies on a refined use of c-splitting sets and their equivalence with multimarginal c-cyclical monotonicity. We then obtain dual attainment and exact primal-dual equality for MOT on arbitrary Polish spaces, together with a canonical representation of optimal dual potentials by c-conjugacy.

We propose a falsification framework that provides a principled statistical test for discriminant validity: the requirement that an algorithm predict intended outcomes better than impermissible ones. Drawing on falsification practices from causal inference, econometrics, and psychometrics, our framework compares calibrated prediction losses across outcomes to assess whether the algorithm exhibits discriminant validity with respect to a specified impermissible proxy. In settings where the target outcome is difficult to observe, multiple permissible proxy outcomes may be available; our framework accommodates both this setting and the case with a single permissible proxy. Throughout we use nonparametric hypothesis testing methods that make minimal assumptions on the data-generating process. We illustrate the method in an admissions setting, where the framework establishes discriminant validity with respect to gender but fails to establish discriminant validity with respect to race. This demonstrates how falsification can serve as an early validity check, prior to fairness or robustness analyses.

    "text": "Scalar reward models compress multi-dimensional human preferences into a single opaque score, creating an information bottleneck that often leads to brittleness and reward hacking in open-ended alignment. We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System OpenRS, a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics PAMR and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics PVRs, which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles, complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks. Finally, we instantiate OpenRS as reward supervision in pairwise RL training.",

We document rapid growth from 1.49 recorded hours in mid-2023 to 2,768.7 total hours in 2025, including 975.89 validated hours available for supervised ASR training. Beyond scale, we analyze validation throughput, contributor participation inequality, demographic metadata completeness, and sentence-level concentration in the validated subset. We find that participation is extremely concentrated Gini  0.941, age representation is strongly skewed toward young adults, and 41.97 of clips lack self-reported gender labels, limiting subgroup auditing based on metadata. At the textual level, prompt reuse is moderate: 35.88 of unique sentences account for 50 of validated clips, suggesting that structural concentration is driven primarily by uneven contributor activity rather than dominance of a small prompt set.

We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context.

Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation SBA is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark MTEB, including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability.

In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought CoT reasoning on patients clinical EHRs.

This pipeline not only enhances the models ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression.

We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertionretrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category.

To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items.

Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access. The study concludes that while L1 transfer and L2 developmental factors influence initial stages of acquisition, appropriate linguistic input and instruction are critical for facilitating UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners.",

Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.",

Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity in todays nonliterary language e.g., the Web than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Webs language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible.",

We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift RIPD. Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judges preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5 helpfulness and 27.9 harmlessness. When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories.

    "text": "Large Language Models LLMs have shown remarkable potential in scientific domains like retrosynthesis; yet, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary to navigate complex problem spaces without error. A critical challenge is directing an LLM to avoid specific, chemically sensitive sites on a molecule - a task where unconstrained generation can lead to invalid or undesirable synthetic pathways. In this work, we introduce Protect, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models LLMs in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55 SMARTS patterns and 40 characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an automatic mode where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a human-in-the-loop mode that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through active state tracking, we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy.",

    "text": "The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models LLMs have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.",

    "text": "Video Language Models VideoLMs empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives specifically motion vectors and residuals which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to 86 and token usage by up to 93 compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on 14 diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.",

    "text": "LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly capable, yet their safety lags behind. This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-realistic settings, we propose a principled taxonomy that transforms single-turn harmful tasks into multi-turn attack sequences. Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark, the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate ASR increases by 16 on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment. Experiments show that ToolShield effectively reduces ASR by 30 on average in multi-turn interactions. Our code is available at",

    "text": "Large Language Model LLM unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization PTQ for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation LoRA: we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset BOOKS and NEWS, LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points NPOGDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10 and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GAGDR 40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76. LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GAKLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 closer to ideal 0, while maintaining strong forgetting VerMem and KnowMem near 0. Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",

Existing LID tools such as OpenLID or GlotLID often struggle to identify closely related languages and to distinguish valid natural language from noise, which contaminates language-specific subsets, especially for low-resource languages. In this work we extend the OpenLID classifier by adding more training data, merging problematic language variant clusters, and introducing a special label for marking noise. We call this extended system OpenLID-v3 and evaluate it against GlotLID on multiple benchmarks. During development, we focus on three groups of closely related languages Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; Romance varieties of Northern Italy and Southern France; and Scandinavian languages and contribute new evaluation datasets where existing ones are inadequate. We find that ensemble approaches improve precision but also substantially reduce coverage for low-resource languages. OpenLID-v3 is available on",

While some of these pressures are universal across languages and cultures, others differ depending on the social and conversational context: language use in newspapers is subject to very different constraints than language use on social media. Prior distributional semantic work on English word emergence neology identified two factors correlated with creation of new words by analyzing a corpus consisting primarily of historical published texts Ryskina et al., 2020, arXiv:2001.07740. Extending this methodology to contextual embeddings in addition to static ones and applying it to a new corpus of Twitter posts, we show that the same findings hold for both domains, though the topic popularity growth factor may contribute less to neology on Twitter than in published writing. We hypothesize that this difference can be explained by the two domains favouring different neologism formation mechanisms.",

In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: textRecalltextOCR, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and textPrecisiontextVE, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, textF1textOCR-VE, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics average Pearsons r  0.97, 0.91, and 0.94 for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively, confirming the frameworks reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.",

Older lines fade, but not when you hit return. They fade when you start writing again. If you pause, they wait.

    "text": "Christiaan Hendrik Persoon 31 December 1761  16 November 1836 was a Cape Colony mycologist who is recognized as one of the founders of mycological taxonomy.  Early life  Persoon was born in Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope, the third child of an immigrant Pomeranian father, Christiaan Daniel Persoon, and Dutch mother, Wilhelmina Elizabeth Groenwald. His mother died soon after he was born. In 1775, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to Europe for his education. His father died a year later in 1776.  Education  Initially a student of theology at Halle, Persoon switched his studies to medicine, which he pursued in Leiden and then Göttingen. He received a doctorate from the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher in Erlangen 1799.  Later years  He moved to Paris by 1803, where he spent the rest of his life, renting the upper floor of a house in a poor part of town. He was apparently unemployed, unmarried, poverty-stricken and a recluse, although he corresponded with botanists throughout Europe. Because of his financial difficulties, Persoon agreed to donate his herbarium to the House of Orange, in return for an adequate pension for life.  Academic career  The origin of Persoons botanical interest is unknown. The earliest of his works was Abbildungen der Schwämme Illustrations of the fungi, published in three parts, in 1790, 1791, and 1793. In 1794, Persoon introduced the term lirella for the furrowed ascomata of the lichen genus Graphis. From 1805 to 1807, he published two volumes of his Synopsis plantarum Archived 20 May 2011 at the Wayback Machine, a popular work describing 20,000 species of all types of plants. But his pioneering work was in the fungi, for which he published several works, beginning with the Synopsis methodica fungorum 1801; it is the starting point for nomenclature of the Uredinales, Ustilaginales, and the Gasteromycetes. Persoon described many polypore species; most were from his own collections in central Europe, while several other tropical species were sent to him from collections made by French botanist Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré during his circumglobal expedition. These latter fungi are among the first tropical polypores ever described. In 1815, Persoon was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Persoon was a prolific author of new fungal species, having formally described 2269 in his career.  Recognition  The genus Persoonia, a variety of small Australian trees and shrubs, was named after him. The title Persoonia is also given to a biannual scientific journal of molecular phylogeny and evolution of fungi, published jointly by the National Herbarium of the Netherlands and the CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre.

In 1995, it was the subject of much media attention after the Fox River Grove level crossing accident that killed seven students. In 2006, on the anniversary of the accident, another Cary-Grove student, Justin Glassmyer, was killed at the same crossing. Located approximately 38 miles northwest of Chicago, the school serves students from Cary, Fox River Grove, the far east side of Crystal Lake, and areas of Barrington, Trout Valley and Oakwood Hills.  Student life   Athletics  The schools team mascot is the Trojan.

First described by Albert Günther in 1877 as Leuciscus hakonensis, it was the type specimen of the genus Tribolodon, having been described again as Tribolodon punctatum by Henri Émile Sauvage when he established that genus in 1883. It is the most widely distributed of the Pseudaspius species, found over much of the Sea of Japan. It is known to carry a number of parasites, including the trematode species Centrocestus armatus for which it is a second intermediate host, and the copepod species Ergasilus fidiformis, which is carried in the fishs gills.  Fishing  Dace are a popular sport fish species. They are known to put up a fight, and to be good for eating. They can be caught with a variety of methods, including float fishing, lure fishing, and legering. Fly fishing for dace using patterns that imitate small fry or invertebrates can be successful. Dace grow to around 50 cm 20 in and 2.3 kg 5 lb or more, but the most common size caught are around 30 cm 1 ft and 450 g 1 lb or less and anything over 40 cm 16 in and 900 g 2 lb is considered a prize catch.

    "text": "Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland v. Liam Adams was a criminal case relating to allegations of child abuse made in 2009 against Liam Adams, brother of Irish politician Gerry Adams. Liam Adams was found guilty in October 2013 of 10 offences, and was sentenced in November 2013 to 16 years in prison.  UTV Insight Special  In December 2009, a UTV Insight Special programme alleged that Liam Adams had sexually abused his daughter, Áine Tyrell, for a decade. In response, his brother Gerry Adams urged Liam to turn himself in to the police. Gerry also alleged that his deceased father, Gerry Adams, Sr., had subjected family members to emotional, physical and sexual abuse. The Police Service of Northern Ireland issued a European Arrest Warrant for Liam Adams arrest.  Extradition request  In December 2009, Liam Adams presented himself at a Garda Síochána police station in Sligo. They were not able to arrest him as they did not have the necessary European Arrest Warrant. Adams did not wish to hand himself into police in Northern Ireland, citing unfairness. On 3 March 2010, the High Court in Dublin endorsed the European Arrest Warrant, which was issued in Liam Adams name by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The following day, Adams handed himself over to the authorities in the Republic. Adams opposed his extradition. At a brief hearing on 21 July, Adams applied for legal aid to help fight the extradition. On 3 October 2011, an Irish High Court judge in Dublin declined Liam Adams objections to the extradition request and said he would issue an order for Adams to surrender to the authorities in Northern Ireland. On 18 October 2011, after losing his appeal against extradition, Adams was remanded in custody for 15 days to a Dublin prison. He was handed over to officers from the PSNI at the border on the night of 2 November, and brought to Laganside Magistrates Court on the morning of 3 November, where he was remanded in custody for a week.  Trials  There were two trials; the first collapsed in April 2013 for legal reasons.  Verdict  In October 2013 Liam Adams was found guilty of ten offences, including rape and gross indecency committed against his daughter between 1977 and 1983 when she was four to nine. On 27 November 2013, Adams was jailed for 16 years with a further two years probation. He died in prison 25 February 2019.  References",

    "text": "David Barry Kitson born 21 January 1980 is an English former professional footballer. Kitson began his career with non-league Hitchin Town and Arlesey Town before he joined Cambridge United in 2001 and became one of the brightest prospects in the Third Division, which led to him being signed by Reading in 2003 for a fee of 150,000. He was part of Readings Championship title winning team that gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time in 2006, with a record 106 points. After two seasons in the top flight Reading were relegated and Kitson signed for Stoke City for a club record fee of 5.5 million. He had loan spells with Reading and Middlesbrough before joining Portsmouth. He spent two seasons at Fratton Park but his contract with Portsmouth was cancelled in August 2012 with the club in danger of being liquidated, and he subsequently joined Sheffield United on a short term deal, before signing a two-year contract at Oxford United in June 2013.  Playing career   Cambridge United  After playing non-league football for Hitchin Town and Arlesey Town, Kitson joined Cambridge United, then in Division Two, in 2001 after being recommended by agent Barry Silkman to Us manager John Beck. He made his debut in 32 victory away over Stoke City on 17 March 2001. On the final day of the same season, Kitson notched his first goal for the club in a 11 draw at Swansea City. The following season saw the club relegated from League One but Kitson scored 10 goals, finishing as the clubs second-top goalscorer, one behind Tom Youngs. In the 200203 season, Kitson scored 25 goals, falling two goals short of David Crowns club record of 27 goals in a season. After 11 goals in 19 appearances at the start of the 200304 season, Kitson left to join Reading, having scored 47 goals in 123 appearances in all competitions for Cambridge.  Reading  Kitson was sold to Reading on 26 December 2003, for a fee of 150,000. He scored five goals in 10 starts in his first season. In the 200506 season, despite injury he went on to record an impressive goals-to-game ratio, and continued to do so as Reading won the Championship title with a record 106 points. Following promotion with Reading, Kitson scored the clubs first Premier League goal in their 32 home win against Middlesbrough on the opening day of the 200607 season, but was then badly injured later in the same match. The injury kept him out of the game until Readings FA Cup victory over Birmingham City on 27 January 2007. On 27 March 2007, he committed his future to Reading, signing a new deal until June 2010. In Readings first Premier League game of the 200708 season, Kitson was sent off less than a minute after coming on as a substitute against Manchester United at Old Trafford, for a challenge on Patrice Evra.  Stoke City  On 18 July 2008, Kitson moved in a 5.5m move from Reading to Stoke City, breaking Stokes record transfer fee. Speculation soon arose as to whether Kitson was settled at Stoke, as he struggled to adapt to the sides style of play after being played out of position by manager Tony Pulis. As a result, he failed to score any goals in any of the 18 competitive games he played for Stoke City in the 200809 season. Chairman Peter Coates and Pulis denied any rumour that he might be leaving the Britannia Stadium. He rejoined Reading on loan until the end of the 200809 season on 10 March 2009. Kitson later revealed that he made the wrong decision in joining Stoke, adding that he and his family were happy at Reading and that I threw all of that away for what I thought was going to be a new challenge... I hold my hands up  it was my fault. I made the decision to go to Stoke, I didnt have to, no-one forced me to go, and it was a bad decision. Addressing his lack of goals for Stoke, he said Id been bought for a lot of money but I wasnt sure I was being utilised in the way I thought I was going to be... You do have some days at training when you go back in and wonder what youre doing there. However, Reading failed to gain promotion, meaning that Kitson returned to Stoke. Kitson stated that he would start his Stoke career again. His first competitive goal for Stoke came in a 10 League Cup win at Leyton Orient on 26 August 2009. He scored his first league goal for Stoke on 29 August 2009, which proved to be the winning goal against Sunderland and then scored again with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. However Kitson lost his place to James Beattie and joined Middlesbrough on a two-month loan. He scored his first goals for Middlesbrough when he scored a brace against Peterborough United on 28 November 2009. He returned to Stoke on 1 January 2010. He scored in the FA Cup against Manchester City and Bolton Wanderers.  Portsmouth  Kitson joined Portsmouth with Liam Lawrence on deadline day as part of a deal which saw Marc Wilson join Stoke City. Kitson made his Portsmouth debut on 11 September 2010 in a 00 dr",

    "text": "The Komast cup also Comast cup is a cup shape at the beginning of the development of Attic drinking cups. Komast cups were widespread especially in Ionia and Corinth. Like other vase painters of the time, the Attic painters were under strong influence from Corinthian vase painting. The name is derived from the artists preferred theme, the kōmos, a ritualistic drunken procession performed by revelers in ancient Greece, whose participants were known as komasts κωμασταί, kōmastaí. This is a motif closely connected with Etruscan vase painting. The typical hemispherical shape with an angled offset lip and a low foot of only 12 centimetres 0.40.8 in height was an Attic development. The interior of the cups is black, only a narrow stripe or band below the lip is left in the base clay colour. The foot and the exterior of the handles are also black. The first specimens were quite large, but throughout the period of their production, the cups became gradually smaller. The most important painters of Komast cups formed the so-called Comast Group, with the KX Painter as its most significant member.  References   Bibliography  Thomas Mannack: Griechische Vasenmalerei.

The name comes from the famous Allatini flourmills founded by the Allatini family in the late 19th century. Moses Allatini operated a roller mill and pottery; his sons founded the Fratelli Allatini company. In 1854 they built the first steam mill in Thessaloniki, together with Darblay de Corblay; they acquired the whole property in 1882. The present-day central building of the Mills was constructed in 1898 according to plans by Vitaliano Poselli after the previous building burnt down. It was inaugurated on 19 September 1900. The building complex includes the administration building old residence, warehouses, refrigeration areas and the roller mill building, surrounded by the boiler room, the machine shop and the chimney of Belgian construction. The Allatini Mills was considered one of the largest, if not the largest, industrial buildings in the Orient, and Posellis most impressive work.

    "text": "The Clandestine Colombian Communist Party in Spanish: Partido Comunista Clandestino Colombiano was an underground communist party in Colombia. It was politically linked to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC, which founded the party in 2000. After FARC officially broke with the Colombian Communist Party CCP, a separate FARC-based party structure came into de facto existence during most of the 1990s, until the PCCC was officially founded in 2000. The partys founder and leader was FARCs commander Guillermo León Sáenz, also known as Alfonso Cano, who was killed in action in 2011.  History  As a result of peace negotiations between FARC and the Colombian government in 1985, FARC, in conjunction with the Colombian Communist Party, founded the Patriotic Union UP as a legal political party that would participate in electoral politics. Although the formation of the UP was a provision of the negotiations with the government, the party was violently repressed by right-wing paramilitary groups as well as Colombian drug lords. Whatever optimism FARC held regarding entrance into mainstream politics was slowly abandoned as the UP all but disintegrated in the late-1980s. Because FARC maintained a rigid ideology, they informally maintained a party structure known as the Bolivarian Movement for a New Colombia in the 1990s. This new emphasis on the figure of Simon Bolivar would later be incorporated into the official ideology of the PCCC. After the end of the Cold War, FARC would not abandon their ideological devotion to MarxismLeninism but they did complement it with nationalist Bolivarian sentiment. The transformation of this movement into the founding of the PCCC was officially announced by FARC in 2000. With the creation of the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force after the Colombian peace process, the party was disbanded, with its members joining the newly established political party.  Ideology  In adherence with Leninism, FARC did not intend for the PCCC to run in bourgeois elections. Instead, the PCCC was to remain underground, serving as the vanguard party for the FARC. As well as keeping the FARC rooted in MarxismLeninism, the PCCC also sought to appeal to other members of the working class in hopes of building a revolutionary class consciousness in Colombia. The existence of an official ideological organ of FARC also helped the organization to legitimize itself as a viable alternative to bourgeois democracy.  Results  As the PCCC never participated in elections, it is difficult to evaluate the partys success in spreading its ideology as a revolutionary vanguard party.  References",

He is the younger brother of Kenenisa Bekele, who is also an accomplished long-distance runner and a former world record holder in both the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres. Tariku is the fourth fastest Ethiopian ever over 5,000 m and 3,000 metres. His indoor 3,000 m best of 7:31.09 ranks him as the ninth fastest of all-time in the event. He was the 10,000 m bronze medallist at the 2012 Summer Olympics. His first major victory came at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where he won the 3,000 m gold medal. He was the 2006 World Junior Champion over the distance and also won a cross country junior bronze medal that year. He took a continental silver medal at the 2007 All-Africa Games.

He won the 3000 m silver medal behind Augustine Choge at the 2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics and stepped up a distance to take the bronze medal over 5000 m at the 2004 World Junior Championships a year later. He beat Paul Tergat in the 2004 Oeiras International Cross Country meeting. He made his senior global debut at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics and finished in seventh place in the 5000 m, just ahead of his more experienced compatriot Dejene Berhanu. He ran the 3000 m at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships, finishing in sixth place. Building upon his successes on the track, he was third in the junior race at the 2006 IAAF World Cross Country Championships while his brother Kenenisa won both senior races. Tariku became the 5000 m junior champion at the 2006 World Junior Championships and was fourth over the distance at the 2006 IAAF World Athletics Final. He took the 3000 m gold at the World Final, however, having also run the third fastest 3000 m time of the season 7:29.11 in a second-place performance behind Isaac Kiprono Songok at the Rieti Meeting. His main focus of the 2007 season was on the 5000 m and he won the silver medal at the 2007 All-Africa Games before going on to take fifth place at the 2007 World Championships over the distance  the best performance by an Ethiopian at the competition. He ascended to the top of his event at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships by winning the indoor 3000 m title at the age of 21  succeeding his brother as the champion in the event. He made his Olympic debut at the 2008 Beijing Games and was sixth over 5000 m. Among other competitions, he competed at the 2008 IAAF World Athletics Final that year, also finishing in sixth. He attempted to defend his world title at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, but it was not to be and he finished in fourth place as Bernard Lagat succeeded him as the 3000 m champion. In the inaugural 2010 IAAF Diamond League series he took two major wins at the Prefontaine Classic and the Weltklasse Zurich meets. He set a world-leading time in the 3000 m at the 2010 Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, running 7:28.70 to finish .30 seconds ahead of Bernard Lagat who set an American record. The 2010 IAAF Continental Cup presented another opportunity as he was selected to represent Africa over 3000 m. Just as had happened indoors, he was fourth and out of the medals while Lagat took the honours. Tariku took to the roads at the end of the track season, competing at the 10-mile Dam tot Damloop race, but he could only manage sixth place with a time of 46:44.

Derrick Koo of The Quietus remarked how Shrinebuilder doesnt try to explore new territory, but it captures its players doing what they do best, but wondered if it is possible for a supergroup like this one to truly step out of its predecessors long shadows.

    "text": "Rasputin is a 2003 Finnish-language opera in three acts by Einojuhani Rautavaara.  Roles   Synopsis   Act I  The Tsarevich, Alexei, has hemophilia, and the family doctors can find no solution. Tsarina Alexandra Alixs lady-in-waiting, Anna, recommends for them to call upon Father Grigori Rasputin. Rasputin soothes the Tsarevich by describing his homeland of Siberia, temporarily lessening his condition. Alix believes this to be a miracle, and from that point forward his influence grows. Rasputin comforts Alix, and there are romantic implications. Then, Khlysts appear and begin to perform a ritual dance. Rasputin eventually sinks into the middle of the crowd, proclaiming that sin redeems us. Meanwhile, Irina is being courted by Felix Yusupov and Dmitri Pavlovich. There are numerous rumors surrounding Felix and Dmitri, claiming that theyre a homosexual couple. Irina discusses this and more with Tsar Nicolas, and he monologues about his worries as Tsar and Father. The act ends with Anna having a terrible feeling about what is going to happen.  Act II  It is Easter night. Iliodor, a hieromonk, and Mitya, a yurodivy holy fool, preach to the people in a very fire-and-brimstone manner. The bishop Hermogen arrives and they lead a processional to the church. The doors open from the inside and Rasputin emerges, Hermogen remarking that he is Like Satan himself. Felix and Dmitri discuss their courting of Irina and flirt. They then conspire with Vladimir Purishkevich to kill Rasputin. They find it deeply offensive that an uneducated peasant has so much control over the royals and Russia in general. Felix also wants Russia to join the war against the Turks, which Rasputin vehemently opposes, knowing that it will further strain Russia. Meanwhile, Rasputin leads what is practically a sex cult, preaching that without sin there is no redemption. He has his way with a couple of the women and starts to drink. Then, multiple guests appear, among them Felix crossdressing, Dmitri, and Vladimir. Vladimir points his gun at Rasputins back multiple times, but each time he evades him. Rasputin, now completely drunk, rants about ruling Russia with the tsarina, dissolving the parliament, and other delusions. The three assassins eventually flee, and Rasputin blacks out. Iliodor and Mitya discuss Rasputins debauchery and they read a letter that seemingly condemns him as being in a relationship with the Tsarina. One of the women from the earlier scene, Gina Guseva, appears and begs the monk to allow her to kill Rasputin, and he gives her a knife. They confront Rasputin. He admits to his sins, and they call him a devil. Guseva stabs Rasputin, and they cry Die, Antichrist!  Act III  Rasputin is recovering in the hospital. He is surrounded by women. When night falls, he freaks out and believes he is being once again tempted by Satan. He sings once again about how Lovely sin must take place before repentance, in a kind of fever dream. Felix is with Irina and inquires about her feelings in a feverish blur of emotions. She says she is with him now and forever, which he is elated by. He then tells her that he plans to kill Rasputin, and she needs to be the bait. She does not want any part of this and leaves. Felix then collapses from ecstasy. In a dream, or perhaps a nightmare, he sees Rasputin, who with his eyes paralyzes him. We see the Tsar, his family, and the doctors again. They are still unable to do anything about Alexei so Alix calls upon Rasputin again. He soothes Alexei into a slumber, and then he manipulates Alix into accepting bribes from various politicians. Alix has a beautiful monologue about the darkening future. Felix, Dmitri, and Vladimir are preparing to kill Rasputin. They poison cookies and wine and prepare the gun. Rasputin arrives and asks about Irinas whereabouts. Felix says she is entertaining and offers him the cookies. Rasputin refuses. He offers him the wine. This time he accepts, but is seemingly unaffected by the poison. Felix eventually shoots Rasputin. The assassins remark that they have saved Russia, but Felix isnt so sure. He goes to check on the body and sure enough, Rasputin awakes, grabbing on to him and trying to escape. Vladimir shoots multiple times, eventually killing him. Alix has a premonition of the Romanovs fate, with Rasputin condemning them and telling them to flee.

    "text": "Sir James Robert George Graham, 2nd Baronet, 1 June 1792  25 October 1861 was a British statesman, who notably served as Home Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty. He was the eldest son of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, by Lady Catherine, eldest daughter of the 7th Earl of Galloway. In 1819, he married Fanny Callander, youngest daughter of Sir James Campbell of Craigforth and Ardkinglas Castle. Sir James was created Doctor of Laws at the University of Cambridge in 1835, was Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow, 1840. He was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1830 to 1834 when he resigned on account of the government pressing for a reform of the Irish Church. He became Secretary of the Home Department from September 1841 to July 1846 and again First Lord of the Admiralty from December 1852 until February 1855. He was a member of the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Deputy Lieutenant for county of Hertfordshire. He represented Kingston upon Hull from 1818 to 1820; for St Ives in 1820; for Carlisle from 1826 until 1829; for East Cumberland from 1830 until 1837; for Pembrokeshire District from 1838 until 1841; for Dorchester from 1841 until 1847; for Ripon from 1847 until July 1852; and was again returned for Carlisle from 1852 until his death in 1861. Graham Land in Antarctica is named after him.  Background and education  Graham was born at Naworth, Cumberland, the son of Sir James Graham, 1st Baronet, by his wife Lady Catherine, daughter of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway. He was taught at a private school at Dalston in Cumberland, kept by the Rev. Walter Fletcher, before attending Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He left Oxford after two years and while travelling for his pleasure abroad, he took up a position of private secretary to Lord Montgomerie, British diplomat in Sicily, during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. When Montgomerie became ill the responsibility for the mission fell on Graham. When Lord William Bentinck returned to the Embassy he agreed that Graham should retain the post. During this time he conducted the negotiations which led to the separation of Joachim Murat from Napoleon. When the war ended he returned to England. Back in London he became friends with Wilfrid Lawson, who went on to join Graham in politics. Lawson also became Grahams brother-in-law and father to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton.  Early political career   Whig beginnings  Back in London, Graham immersed himself in political affairs. Although his father was a staunch Tory he made his headquarters in Brookss Club where he made many Whig contacts. On 10 June 1818 he announced that he would contest the mercantile borough of Hull. Known at the time as the Yorkshire Dandy on account of his fine appearance and flowery speech, he stood on the Whig doctrine of Parliamentary reform, the abolition of unnecessary positions and pensions, peace, retrenchment, the abolition of the slave trade, and religious and civil liberties. After three days of open voting and official scrutiny, Graham entered parliament as the junior member by a mere four votes. However, he had gained the seat at great personal expense and notwithstanding other donations accrued a debt of 6,000. In January 1820, George IV succeeded thus forcing a dissolution of parliament. As a result of his past support for radical measures he failed to gain the necessary support to retain the Yorkshire seat and in consequence he stood and won the Cornish seat of St Ives, heading the poll with 205 votes. At Westminster, Graham maintained his campaign for economy, generally opposing the Governments proposed increase in the Royal Familys Civil List. However his parliamentary career, although undistinguished, now became brief: when charged with bribing the electorate he resigned rather than contest an expensive suit.  Agricultural improver  Graham returned to Cumberland and began a programme of improving the family estate at Netherby, with the intention that such improvements would benefit both the landowner and the tenant. He began with a one-off gesture, wiping out the arrears of his tenants debts. He reduced the number of small uneconomic farms on the estate; he rebuilt the cottages and farm-buildings, introduced tile drains whereby much marshy land was reclaimed, and improved the breed of stock on the estate, spending in excess of 100,000 over a twenty-year period. He eventually studied the Corn Laws and their effects upon the community, publishing his conclusions in a pamphlet of 114 pages entitled Corn and Currency, which brought him into prominence as a man of advanced Liberal opinions. He argued that liberal economics rather than protection would best serve the interests of the landowners. High duties on foreign corn had failed to help British agriculture and should be cut to a level where they simply balanced the landowners taxes and rates. Whereas high prices increased rents to the benefit",

    "text": "Richard Michael Corcoran born March 16, 1965 is an American attorney, education administrator, and former politician. He served as member of the Florida House of Representatives for two districts, he represented the 45th district from 2010 to 2012 and the 37th district from 2012 to 2018. He served as the one hundredth speaker of the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2018. He served as the 27th education commissioner of Florida from 2019 to 2022. He has served as president of New College of Florida since 2023. He is a member of the Republican Party.  Early life and education  He was born and raised in Canada. After age 11 Corcoran resided in Pasco County, Florida, to which his family moved during 1976. His parents were both veterans of World War II. His father had served in the U.S. Army and his mother, a daughter of a British tea-planter, had served in the Womens Auxiliary Air Force of the Royal Air Force during the London Blitz. After attending and dropping out of the University of Florida, Corcoran earned a bachelors degree in 1989 from St. Leo College. During 19871993, he served six years in the United States Naval Reserve. In 1996, he earned a Juris Doctor from Regent University School of Law. Three years later he took and passed the Florida Bar.  Political, legal, and education career   19892005  Corcorans first job after graduation from St. Leo was with Rep. John Renke of New Port Richey, state Republican house leader, until the election defeat of Renke by Phil Mishkin in a race orchestrated by T. K. Wetherell, the house speaker and future FSU president. Corcoran then worked as a legislative aide for his friend Paul Hawkes, representative in the Florida House from 1990 to 1994. Corcoran ran the 1994 initial election campaign for Mike Fasano to the Florida House who later would become majority leader and senate president. Between 1996 and 1998, Corcoran was deputy to Daniel Webster, the first Republican elected as house speaker in a century. In 1998, when for the first time he sought to be elected to a seat in the Florida house of representatives, Corcoran ran his own campaign. He lost the race in the Republican primary to Nancy Argenziano, who was elected to the 19962002 term and went on to be elected a state senator in 2002. Corcoran was admitted to the Florida Bar on September 21, 1999, three years after completing law school. He worked as outside counsel for former House Speaker Tom Feeney in 2002.  20062010  In 2006, Corcoran worked for candidate Marco Rubio, where he was involved in writing and promoting Rubios political tract 100 Innovative Ideas for Floridas Future. After that years election, he became chief of staff to the new House Speaker. Corcoran resigned to prepare for a 2007 state senate election bid for the seat being vacated by Argenzianos appointment to the Public Service Commission, but Corcoran dropped out of the race prior to the general election, which would be won by Charles S. Dean Sr. When he was chief aide to Marco Rubio, Corcorans spending of Republican Party of Florida funds drew scrutiny. His spending on flights, hotels, and restaurants from party funds in 2015 and 2016 also drew critics. Corcoran rejected suggestions that the spending such as an 8,000 meal at The French Laundry in Napa Valley was excessive. Corcoran also was hired by future governor Rick Scott to do legal work for Solantic.  20102018  When incumbent state representative Tom Anderson was unable to seek re-election due to term limits in 2010, Corcoran ran a successful campaign to succeed him in the 45th District, which included parts of southern Pasco County and northern Pinellas County. During his term, Corcoran secured promises from fellow Republican representatives to elect him to the office of speaker for the 20162018 legislative session if he won that election. His leading rival for the position was fellow freshman representative Matt Gaetz. At the time, Corcoran released an 80-page reform manifesto entitled Blue Print Florida. In 2011, he was hired as counsel at the Tampa offices of the law firm Broad and Cassel. When the state legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Corcoran was drawn into the 37th District, which included some of the areas in Pasco County that he represented in the 45th District. Corcoran faced a challenge from Strother Hammond in the Republican primary. He was endorsed for re-election by The Tampa Tribune. Corcoran defeated Hammond, gathering nearly 84 of the vote. Corcoran was subsequently re-elected without opposition in both 2014 and 2016. During his time as representative, he led an effort to oppose Medicaid expansion. He criticized Enterprise Florida and Visit Florida. As he had secured promised commitments from fellow representatives while campaigning in 2010, following his 2016 election, Corcoran became speaker of the Florida House of Representatives for the 20162018 legislative session.

    "text": "Frank Paul Beyer German: fʁaŋk ˈbaɪ.ɐ ; 26 May 1932  1 October 2006 was a German film director. In East Germany he was one of the most important film directors, working for the state film monopoly DEFA and directed films that dealt mostly with the Nazi era and contemporary East Germany. His film Trace of Stones was banned for 20 years in 1966 by the ruling SED. His 1975 film Jacob the Liar was the only East German film ever nominated for an Academy Award. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 until his death he mostly directed television films.  Biography   Early life and career  Frank Beyer was born as Frank Paul Beyer in Nobitz in Thuringia, Germany, to Paul Beyer, a clerk, and Charlotte Beyer, a sales clerk. He had a brother, Hermann Beyer born 30 May 1943 who should have become a successful actor. After the Machtergreifung of the Nazi Party in 1933 his father, a social democrat lost his job and was unemployed for several years. In 1942 he was drafted for military service and was killed one year later at the Eastern Front. In 1938 Frank Beyer started attending primary school in Nobitz, and later the Realgymnasium Ernestinum in Altenburg. His education was interrupted for a few months in the aftermath of World War II. In fall 1946 he continued his education in Altenburg and played in an amateur dramatic society. He also became a member of the Free German Youth and later of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. After finishing school with his Abitur in 1950 he wanted to study history at the University of Leipzig, but at the request of the socialist unity party he stayed in Altenburg and worked as district party secretary for the local cultural association. At the same time he trained to become a film projectionist, and being interested in theater wrote play reviews for the local newspaper. Later he worked at the theater of the towns of Crimmitschau and Glauchau as an assistant director and dramaturge. In 1952 Frank Beyer began to study drama at Humboldt University in Berlin, but transferred to the Film School of the Academy of Performing Arts FAMU in Prague shortly afterwards. In Prague he studies film directing together with his future colleagues Konrad Petzold and Ralf Kirsten. In 1954 he works as an intern at the DEFA film studio during the production of the film Ernst Thälmann  Sohn seiner Klasse directed by Kurt Maetzig. He completed another internship as an assistant director for a film adapted from the opera Zar und Zimmermann and directed by Hans Müller. In his fourth year of studies, in 1957, he worked as an assistant director for Kurt Maetzigs two part film Schlösser und Katen with a special permission of his university. In 1957 he graduated from FAMU with the anti-war film Zwei Mütter. Based on a screenplay by Leonie Ossowski, his diploma film tells the story of a French and a German mother that fight for a child that has been mistakenly taken by the German after a bomb raid. The film had a theatrical release and became a success.  Beyer at the DEFA studios 19571967  After graduation Frank Beyer worked as a freelancer for the DEFA studios. He had declined an offer for a permanent position as an assistant director, as he would have been assigned to film projects and would not have had the freedom to choose. He started his directorial career with two short films in the satirical film series Das Stacheltier. His second feature film Eine alte Liebe based on a story by Werner Reinowski and released in 1958 did not follow the success of his directorial debut Zwei Mütter. His third feature film Five Cartridges released in 1960 was a major critical and popular success and made him known in East Germany and abroad. The film was based on a screenplay by Walter Gorrish and tells the story of the members of an international brigade during the Spanish Civil War. He continued to direct films that focused on anti-fascist themes. The 1962 film Star-Crossed Lovers was again based on a screenplay by Walter Gorrish and told the story of the antifascist activist Michael who has to serve in a penal military unit on the Eastern Front during World War II, and escapes with the help of his childhood friend Jürgen. Deserting to the Red army he hopes to meet his childhood friend and love Magdalena in Moscow, as she had fled from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. The experimental film made extensive use of flashbacks and extreme angles of view to express the emotions of the characters. His next project was the 1963 film Naked Among Wolves based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Bruno Apitz. The film told the story of prisoners in the Buchenwald concentration camp who risk their lives to hide a Jewish boy, Stefan Jerzy Zweig. The film is now regarded as a classic anti-fascist DEFA studio films. His next film, the 1963 comedy Carbide and Sorrel was a major popular success. In 1966 Frank Beyer directed the film Trace of Stones based on a novel by Erik Neutsch. The film is set in co",

The first batch of lithium iron phosphate energy productions came out of China Sun Groups production lines in April 2009. In June, China Sun Group entered into contracts with four battery production companies to begin testing samples of lithium iron phosphate. Once this testing is complete, the company plans to begin mass marketing the product domestically. The testing involves running the batteries on the natural attenuation rate curve, which measures the rate of decay over time on a curve. Early reports have indicated that customer testing indicated good consistency with little decay, which is very promising given the market potential for the products in several major Chinese provinces.

    "text": "Its My Party is a song by English singer-songwriter Jessie J, released as the second single from her second studio album, Alive 2013. The song was written by Jessie J, Claude Kelly, John Lardieri and Colin Norman, and produced by Lardieri and Kelly. The track premiered on UK radio on 5 August 2013 and was officially released in the UK via iTunes on 15 September 2013. Jessie J recorded the official video at the end of June and it was directed by Emil Nava.  Background  Its My Party is a mid-tempo song in the key of A major, written by Jessie J, Claude Kelly John Lardieri  Colin Norman. The song received its first radio play on Capital FM on 5 August 2013 and was released on 15 September 2013. The song shares its title with Lesley Gores 1963 hit song. Speaking on the syndicated radio show, In:Demand with Alex James, Jessie revealed that it was her detractors who inspired the song. A lot of the time the haters  I hate calling them haters but thats the easiest way to sum it up  they need love more so than anyone else, she said. I dont think hate does anything for the world. It doesnt do any good. I wanted to make sure I had a song that represented what Im about.  Reception  Its My Party garnered mixed reviews from critics. UnrealityTV gave Its My Party three stars out of five wrote, I feel Jessies vocals are distorted at times on Its My Party, the chord is too high  it was the same problem with Wild at points in the song. Kevipod of DirectLyrics said, On the first listen, Its My Party sounds like a big utter mess. It strikes as generic, not current, the vocals are a mess, and the talking she does is...I cannot find the right words to describe this. Whats happening to Jessie J this era?. For real!. Karen Lanza of PopCrush commented: Hearing a song called Its My Party, you expect to indulge the recording artist as much as you do your bestie when she throws herself a birthday bash. It is, after all, her party, and shell most likely do whatever the heck she wants. But it doesnt mean you have to like it. With her newly released single, Jessie J fails to take full advantage of the listeners goodwill following the urban-edged Wild, the well-received first track off of her as-yet-untitled second album. With its frantic beats and eff-off lyrics, Its My Party aims to be a full-stop dance-floor anthem for the waning days of summer. The lyrics are indeed fun  who doesnt love telling off haters?  but the tune itself is lacking the hooks to keep you from forgetting it the second its 3 minutes, 38 seconds are over.  Music video  The music video was directed by Emil Nava. Jessie told about the songs music video. Its basically me having parties, she said. Three very different parties that I kind of bring together as one big party. Theres some cameos in there, some of my best mates in there Daley and model Jourdan Dunn. Its a fun video where its just me being silly. A lot of humor. John Walker of MTV Buzzworthy commented: The clip opens on our boisterous heroine alone in a hallway, where she peeps through the keyholes into two very different party scenes: the first prim and proper, the second completely OOC. Obviously Jessie picks the fun party, where she bounces around with her newfound freak friends including model Anita De Bauch and breaks into the chorus: Its my party Ill do what I want.

    "text": "The term monumental sculpture is often used in art history and criticism, but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians, although in contemporary art a rather larger overall scale is implied. Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable figurines, small metal or ivory reliefs, diptychs and the like. The term is also used to describe sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a monument of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, tomb monuments or memorials, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just funerary sculpture for church monuments. The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are. The entry for Monumental in A Dictionary of Art and Artists by Peter and Linda Murray describes it as: The most overworked word in current art history and criticism. It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for large. However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or used in a memorial may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate. For example, when Meyer Schapiro, after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at Moissac, says: in the tympanum of the south portal right the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental. It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance. It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ..., size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiros further comments suggest that a lack of excess of virtuousity does not form part of what he intends to convey. Nonetheless, parts of the Murrays concept grand, noble, elevated in idea are included in his meaning, although simple in conception and execution hardly seems to apply.  Meaning in different contexts  It is only in wealthy societies that the possibility of creating sculptures that are large but merely decorative really exists at least in long-lived materials such as stone, so for most of art history the different senses of the term cause no difficulties. The term may be used differently for different periods, with breaks occurring around the Renaissance and the early 20th century: for ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally the criterion, though smaller architectural sculptures are usually covered by the term, but in the Early Modern period a specific funerary function may be meant, before the typical meaning once again comes to refer to size alone for contemporary sculpture. The relevant chapters in Parts 2-4 of The Oxford History of Western Art are titled as follows: Monumental Sculpture to c.1300, Monumental Sculpture 13001600, Free-standing Sculpture c.1600c.1700, Forms in Space c.17001770, Sculptures and Publics 17701914.  In art history   Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture  In archeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture using the size criterion in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains; the totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology. The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. In Ancient Egypt, the Great Sphinx of Giza probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC, and may be older than the Pyramids of Egypt. The discovery in 1986 of an ancient Chinese Bronze Age 8.5-foot-tall 2.6 m bronze statue at Sanxingdui disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known. Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valle",

    "text": "Activity-based costing ABC is a costing method that identifies activities in an organization and assigns the cost of each activity to all products and services according to the actual consumption by each. Therefore, this model assigns more indirect costs overhead into direct costs compared to conventional costing. The UKs Chartered Institute of Management Accountants CIMA, defines ABC as an approach to the costing and monitoring of activities which involves tracing resource consumption and costing final outputs. Resources are assigned to activities, and activities to cost objects based on consumption estimates. The latter utilize cost drivers to attach activity costs to outputs. The Institute of Cost Accountants of India says, ABC systems calculate the costs of individual activities and assign costs to cost objects such as products and services on the basis of the activities undertaken to produce each product or services. It accurately identifies sources of profit and loss. The Institute of Cost  Management Accountants of Bangladesh ICMAB defines activity-based costing as an accounting method which identifies the activities which a firm performs and then assigns indirect costs to cost objects.  Objectives  With ABC, a company can soundly estimate the cost elements of entire products, activities and services, that may help inform a companys decision to either: Identify and eliminate those products and services that are unprofitable and lower the prices of those that are overpriced product and service portfolio aim, or Identify and eliminate production or service processes which are ineffective, and allocate processing concepts that lead to the very same product at a better yield process re-engineering aim In a business organization, the ABC methodology assigns an organizations resource costs through activities to the products and services provided to its customers. ABC is generally used as a tool for understanding product and customer cost and profitability based on the production or performing processes. As such, ABC has predominantly been used to support strategic decisions such as pricing, outsourcing, identification and measurement of process improvement initiatives.  Prevalence  Following strong initial uptake, ABC lost ground in the 1990s compared to alternative metrics, such as Kaplans balanced scorecard and economic value added. An independent 2008 report concluded that manually driven ABC was an inefficient use of resources: it was expensive and difficult to implement for small gains, and a poor value, and that alternative methods should be used. Other reports show the broad band covered with the ABC methodology. However, application of an activity based recording may be applied as an addition to activity based accounting, not as a replacement of any costing model, but to transform concurrent process accounting into a more authentic approach.  Historical development  Traditionally, cost accountants had arbitrarily added a broad percentage of analysis into the indirect cost. In addition, activities include actions that are performed both by people and machine. However, as the percentages of indirect or overhead costs rose, this technique became increasingly inaccurate, because indirect costs were not caused equally by all products. For example, one product might take more time in one expensive machine than another productbut since the amount of direct labor and materials might be the same, additional cost for use of the machine is not being recognized when the same broad on-cost percentage is added to all products. Consequently, when multiple products share common costs, there is a danger of one product subsidizing another. ABC is based on George Staubus Activity Costing and Input-Output Accounting. The concepts of ABC were developed in the manufacturing sector of the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. During this time, the Consortium for Advanced Management-International, now known simply as CAM-I, provided a formative role for studying and formalizing the principles that have become more formally known as Activity-Based Costing. Robin Cooper and Robert S. Kaplan, proponents of the Balanced Scorecard, brought notice to these concepts in a number of articles published in Harvard Business Review beginning in 1988. Cooper and Kaplan described ABC as an approach to solve the problems of traditional cost management systems. These traditional costing systems are often unable to determine accurately the actual costs of production and of the costs of related services. Consequently, managers were making decisions based on inaccurate data especially where there are multiple products. Instead of using broad arbitrary percentages to allocate costs, ABC seeks to identify cause and effect relationships to objectively assign costs. Once costs of the activities have been identified, the cost of each activity is attributed to each product to the extent that the prod",

    "text": "Football is the most popular sport in Qatar. Almost half of the people in Qatar are interested in football Football in Qatar is organized by the Qatar Football Association QFA. Qatar has hosted the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup, 2023 AFC Asian Cup, and the 2024 AFC U-23 Asian Cup.  History   Origins 1940s1950s  Football was introduced to the country in the 1940s when oil workers from India and northern Arab states organized a match among themselves. The first documented teams in Qatar was a team formed for the Northern Arab Region, and also a team formed the near the Al-Khatia area of Dukhan. The Hazel Dayne Cup was the inaugural competition in the area, teams including Al-Najah, Al-Shorta, Al-Tahrir, and Al-Maaref took part in the tournament. A subsequent competition was the Izz al-Din Championship organised by 1951 which was founded by the Qatar Oil Company. Eventually, the name was changed to the Pukett Cup in the late 1950s. The first football club formed in the Qatari region was Al-Shorta in 1938. While Al-Najah now known as Al-Ahli followed, becoming the first professional club in the region, being established in 1950. It was established by the founders of another club, which was called Sawt al-Arab, clubs were eventually formed afterwards which would go on to participate in the Qatari League. In 1957, the Qatari youth squad won the Al-Qusaibi Cup for the first time, defeating the Saudi Al-Ettifaq club, the league winners at the time, by 32. This was the first trophy won outside of Qatars boundaries. The Qatari Al-Nasr team also played a friendly match against the Al-Ittihad, winning 20 and received a massive silver-plated trophy which was built in Pakistan specifically for the occasion. Football went from Dukhan to the neighbourhoods of Qatars capital, Doha, near the conclusion of this century and the beginning of the 1960s, when the official foundation of clubs began.  Early years 1960s1970s  The QFA also known as the Qatar Football Association was formed in 1960. And in 1963 The federation joined FIFA. Eventually also joining the AFC in 1967. With growing interest among youth and communities in the region, eventually a league was formed. The league came to be known as the Qatari League was formed in 1960 and the first league season was launched in 196364. League matches were held at the Doha Stadium, it was not until the 197273 season where the league officially started. League titles in the 1960s were dominated by clubs like Al-Maaref, Al-Oruba, Al Sadd, etc. The Doha Stadium held and accommodated the first grass football pitch in the gulf region. Alongside several youth events which Qatari footballers like Badr Bilal, Ibrahim Khalfan, Khalid Salman, Mansour Muftah, participated in. It also saw the formation of the first Qatari school team, which participated in the 1963 Arab School Games held in Kuwait. The 1960s also saw numerous teams come to play in Qatar, such as Ismaily SC, Taj FC, Al-Riffa, Al-Muharraq, etc. In 1960, the first committee responsible for organizing sports activities in Qatar was established under the name Qatar Sports Federation for Sports Games. It was chaired by Sheikh Suhaim bin Hamad Al Thani, with Hitmi Al Hitmi, Majid bin Saad Al Saad, and Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Mutawa serving as members. The committees work was short-lived and came to an end following the resignation of its members. In 1962, the committee was reconstituted under the chairmanship of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani. Hitmi Hamad Al Hitmi was appointed Vice Chairman, Mohammed bin Ali Al Ansari served as Secretary, and Majid bin Saad Al Saad and Mohammed Salah Morsi, the latter representing the Ministry of Education served as members. The committee also appointed Professor Fawzi Al-Dali, a Syrian educator, as a consultant to assist in drafting regulations for local competitions. A permanent headquarters was established for the committee in two ministry-owned villas located near Doha Stadium. The headquarters was furnished and supplied with official documentation, while regulations and administrative programs were developed to organize football activities. During this period, the committee laid down the fundamental rules of football in Qatar and defined its organizational objectives. It regularly consulted with sports and cultural clubs, offered technical guidance, organized local tournaments, and drafted regulations governing clubs and competitions. The committee also organized the first national football league for clubs, utilizing the facilities of Al-Maaref Club. In 1963, the committee was formed for the third time following an increase in the number of sports clubs in Doha and other regions, which made it necessary to reorganize sports activities in the country.

    "text": "Charlton Viaduct is a disused railway bridge in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in south-west England. It is a Grade II listed building.  History  The bridge was built in 1874 by the civil engineer William Henry Barlow for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway SDJR to carry its line from Evercreech to the south, through the Mendip Hills, towards Bath. It crosses the River Sheppey at the north-eastern edge of Shepton Mallet, where the railway curves around a patch of high ground. The bridge was built in locally mined grey limestone and originally carried a single track. The line was double-tracked in 1894 and the viaduct was widened with blue brick and faced with stone. The line closed in 1966 as a result of the Beeching cuts. The viaduct is a Grade II listed building, first listed on 20 May 1952, a status which provides legal protection from demolition. In 2023, a scheme was approved to turn part of the SDJR route into a walking and cycling trail, including the nearby Ham Wood Viaduct and Bath Road Viaduct and Windsor Hill Tunnel. The promoters of the scheme hoped to extend it to Shepton Mallet via Charlton Viaduct in a later phase.  Design  The viaduct is 317 yards 290 metres. It consists of 27 segmental arches each of which has a span of 28 feet 8.5 metres and with a maximum height of 45 feet 14 metres. It is on a curve of 30 chains 600 m radius falling at 1 in 55 from each end to the midpoint. To cope with the curve the arches are strengthened by buttresses at every third pier. The arch barrels and piers are in brick but faced in masonry. The spandrels, and parapets are entirely in masonry. The viaduct is one of seven on the route, all built to a similar specification. The next structure on the line, the Bath Road Viaduct, is particularly similar and is also a listed building. The Bath Road Viaduct is taller but only has six arches to Charltons twenty-seven. The viaduct can be seen from the grounds of Kilver Court where it forms a feature.  See also  Grade II listed buildings in Mendip  References   External links  Aerial video of the viaduct",

    "text": "Middlethorpe Hall is a 17th-century English country house standing in 20 acres 8 ha of grounds in Middlethorpe, York, North Yorkshire. It is a perfectly symmetrical red brick and stone house built in 1699 and since 2008 has been owned by the National Trust. It is currently used as a hotel.  Description  The house is quite close to the road which is unusual for its architectural standard. Like many grand houses of the time, it is influenced indirectly by Sir Christopher Wren, especially Hampton Court Palace with a similar horizontal skyline and pattern of red brick, white sash windows and stone quoins and window surrounds. The north entrance front of seven bays and three storeys plus a basement is surrounded by a stone eagle, the Barlow family crest. The pedimented porch over the front door is an early 19th-century addition and the curved railings and gates enclosing the forecourt were added in 1983. The south front, the main façade of the house, is surmounted by a raised stone parapet of three panels containing carved festoons and crowned by another stone eagle. It is more impressive than the north front because of the flanking wings added in the mid-18th century by Francis Barlow. The bays of these single storey additions are divided by pilasters with well carved composite capitals and are surmounted by a balustraded parapet. The front door leads straight into the stone-flagged entrance hall, as in a medieval house. Beyond to the south is a carved oak staircase with fluted and foliated balusters, a York motif, standing on steps with scrolled panelled ends. The staircase is supported by a Corinthian column and may have been moved at some point. The floor is paved with black and white marble squares. There is a panelled drawing room leading to an enormous ballroom occupying the western of the two wings added c. 1750. The dining room dates from the original period and has round head panels flanked by Ionic pilasters.  History  The house was built in c. 16991701 for Thomas Barlow, a prosperous master cutler who bought the Middlethorpe estate in 1698 as a bid to establish himself as a country gentleman. In 1712, Thomas Barlow and his son Francis went on the Grand Tour and let the house in August 1713 for a year to Lady Mary Wortley and her Daughter Lady Mary Anne Wortley who married John Stuart Montague 3rd Earl of Bute in 1736 in their absence. Francis later served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 173436. The house descended in the Barlow family to Frances Barlow, who married Manchester based physician Matthew Alexander Eason Wilkinson 18131878 and moved away. Frances Wilkinson died after a brief marriage but her husband and his second wife Louisa Letitia, née Walker c. 18261889 lived at the hall with their six children. The gardens at Middlethorpe Hall are credited with inspiring the career of their daughter Fanny Wilkinson, the first professional female landscape designer in Britain. For most of the 19th and early 20th century, the house remained in the Wilkinson family but was let to various tenants. From 1851 it was occupied by a girls boarding school for 30 years. In 1972, it became Brummels night club. In 1980, it was acquired by Historic House Hotels, who improved and restored the grounds and outbuildings with hundreds of trees planted and the addition of a ha-ha and lake. A dilapidated late 17th-century dovecote was restored, the kitchen garden was replanted, and stable buildings were converted and extended for additional hotel accommodation. The hall and grounds were then gifted to the National Trust by the directors of Historic House Hotels HHH. The hall continues its present use as a hotel under the existing HHH management. Three National Trust directors joined the HHH board and all profits will go to Trust funds to provide for the long-term care of the house. The gift had been under discussion for almost 30 years and in 1997 the National Trust accepted restrictive covenants over the property. Trustees of the National Trust completed the transfer deal in September 2008 by declaring the hall together with two other properties inalienable. It is envisaged that arrangements will be put in place for the gardens and grounds of the hall to be open to visitors, along with tours of the ground floor rooms. Members of the Trust are welcome as hotel guests, as are members of the public.  See also  Grade II listed buildings in the City of York  References   External links  Historic England.

Critical reception  Martin Woodside of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying: Most of the songs here are built around fantasy, and Cages fantasies tend to be dark and angry, revolving around sex, violence, and substance abuse. He added: The team of producers lays down a diverse blend of styles that matches Cages bizarre, brooding vocals from beginning to end. Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

    "text": "Master Oats 14 May 1986  21 May 2012 was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. A specialist steeplechaser, he ran twenty-one time and won ten races. He campaigned mainly at distances in excess of three miles and was particularly effective on soft or heavy ground. Over a period of sixteen months between November 1993 and March 1995 Master Oats won nine of his eleven races and improved from racing in minor handicaps to becoming the highest-rated staying chaser in Britain. His winning run culminated in a win in the 1995 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He also ran in three editions of the Grand National, twice carrying top weight. His later career was disrupted by injury and he failed to win again after his Gold Cup success. Master Oats was retired from racing in 1998 and died in 2012.  Background  Master Oats was a chestnut horse with a narrow white stripe bred by Robin and Scarlett Knipe at the Cobhall Court Stud near Allensmore in Herefordshire. He was sired by Oats, a successful National Hunt stallion whose other progeny included the Champion Hurdle winner Flakey Dove. Master Oats was sent to the Doncaster Sales as a foal in 1986 where he was sold for 6,000. He first raced in the colours of Mrs Hugh Maitland-Jones and was sent into training with Henrietta Knight. After one run in an amateur Point-to-point race he was moved to the Lambourn stable of Kim Bailey, who trained him throughout the rest of his racing career. Master Oats usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Throughout his racing career, Master Oats suffered from a tendency to break blood vessels under stress, and therefore had to be trained with unusual care.  Racing career   19911992: early career  Unlike many steeplechasers, Master Oats never competed in National Hunt flat races or over hurdles. He ran once without success in an amateur point-to-point race before beginning his career under National Hunt rules in Novice chases. After being pulled-up at Newbury Racecourse in November, he was campaigned at minor tracks, winning at Southwell Racecourse and being place at Wolverhampton and Stratford. After his first season, Master Oats racing career was disrupted by injury and he was off the racecourse for eighteen months. During this time he entered into the ownership of Paul Matthews.  19931994 season  Master Oats returned in November 1993 with an official rating of 107, placing him approximately sixty pounds below championship class. He began in a handicap race at Uttoxeter Racecourse and won by a length and a half despite breaking a blood vessel. This was the first occasion on which he was ridden by Norman Williamson who became his regular jockey. In late December he won a similar event at Huntingdon Racecourse by twelve lengths under top weight of 165 pounds and then finished second at Wincanton in January. Later that month he won a handicap at Lingfield Park by two lengths despite being eased down by Williamson at the finish. Master Oats rating had moved up to 137 by this time although his most valuable race win had earned bis owners less than 4,000. Master Oats next race saw him take on much stronger opposition in the Greenalls Gold Cup over three and a half miles at Kempton Park moved from Haydock Park because of bad weather. The race was considered a trial for the Grand National and attracted leading chasers including Garrison Savannah Cheltenham Gold Cup, Young Hustler RSA Chase and Moorcroft Boy Scottish Grand National. Williamson sent Master Oats into the lead four fences from the finish and the gelding turned the race into a procession according to The Independent staying on strongly on the soft ground to win by fifteen lengths. At Aintree Racecourse on 9 April, Master Oats started third favourite of the thirty-six runners in the 1994 Grand National at odds of 91, and was expected to be ideally suited by the heavy ground. Master Oats appeared to be going well and was moving up towards the leaders when he fell at the thirteenth fence of the race won by Miinnehoma. The horse was not injured and returned two weeks later to end his season with a very easy win under top weight in a race at Perth.  19941995 season  Master Oats first run of the 199495 season saw him pitted against the 1992 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Cool Ground and the 1992 Grand National winner Party Politics in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow. He took the lead at the eleventh fence and stayed on to repel the challenge of Party Politics by four lengths. On New Years Eve Master Oats started 52 joint favourite for the Welsh National over three and three quarter miles on heavy ground. The race was moved to Newbury from its traditional venue at Chepstow, where racing had been abandoned owing to the weather and ground conditions. Williamson sent him into the lead four fences from the finish and the horse steadily increased his lead to win by twenty lengths from Earth Summit. After the race he was heavily backed for the Cheltenham Go",

Heins pieces show a special pianoesque ability to fashion pretty melodies picturesquely in the salon style of the time. His competency on the keyboard led him to perform and compose. He composed the song Zwei Dunkle Augen, which was recorded by the tenor Fritz Wunderlich. Stylistically his music is similar to that of his older compatriot Carl Bohm. Robert Leonhardt, an operatic baritone who sang with the New York Metropolitan Opera company between 1913 and 1922, made numerous recordings for many major record labels, both in Europe and in the United States. An early recording he made on Gramophone 42325 with matrix number 1113B54 was Zwei dunkle Augen by Carl Heins. Leonhardt recorded it onto a 78rpm in October 1901 when he was 24.

    "text": "Peter Harry Steve Griffiths 24 May 1928  20 November 2013 was a British Conservative politician best known for gaining the Smethwick seat by defeating the Shadow Foreign Secretary Patrick Gordon Walker in the 1964 general election, against the national trend, by using anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric.  Early life  Griffiths was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, and attended West Bromwich Grammar School. He was educated at Leeds Teacher Training College and, after his National Service, studied for an external London University economics degree and a masters degree in education at Birmingham University, while teaching in West Bromwich. From 1962, he was the head of Hall Green Road primary school, West Bromwich. Griffiths was elected to Smethwick County Borough Council in 1955. At the 1959 election, he stood against Smethwicks sitting Member of Parliament MP Patrick Gordon Walker for the first time, and succeeded in reducing Gordon Walkers majority from 6,495 to 3,544. Griffiths became leader of the councils Conservative group in 1960, serving as a local councillor until 1963 when he resigned to stand again for the Smethwick parliamentary seat in the forthcoming general election.  Elected MP for Smethwick  Labours victory in the 1964 election had been predicted, and Patrick Gordon Walker, who had been Shadow Foreign Secretary for 18 months, was expected to hold on to his seat. Instead, Griffiths gained the seat for the Conservatives on a 7 swing, in a county borough that had the highest percentage of recent immigrants to England. Racial discrimination was common in the constituency and nationally; the local Labour club operated a colour bar. In what Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson later described as an utterly squalid campaign, Conservative party members were accused of having used the slogan If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour. Colin Jordan, a British Neo-Nazi and leader of the British Movement, said that members of his group had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the poster and sticker campaign; Jordans group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: Dont vote  a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!. Although Griffiths himself did not coin the phrase or approve its use, he declined to disown it. The Times quoted Griffiths as saying: I would not condemn any man who said that. I regard it as a manifestation of popular feeling, adding that the quote represented exasperation, not fascism. He denied that there was any resentment in Smethwick on the grounds of race or colour. Griffiths defeat of Gordon Walker resulted in Harold Wilson saying in the House of Commons that Griffiths should serve his term here as a parliamentary leper. Conservatives urged the Speaker, Harry Hylton-Foster, to force Wilson to withdraw the comment. While the Speaker objected to such language, he refused to censure the Prime Minister, and order in the Commons chamber was not restored for ten minutes. In his maiden speech in the Commons, Griffiths pointed out the problems faced by local industry and drew attention to the fact that 4,000 families were awaiting local authority accommodation. Griffiths remained an alderman in Smethwick until 1966. He both supported and arranged for Smethwick council to purchase a row of houses with the intention of letting them exclusively to white families. The governments Housing minister, Richard Crossman, was able to block this proposal by refusing the council permission to borrow the money required. Griffiths was defeated by the actor and Labour candidate Andrew Faulds in the 1966 general election. Griffiths wrote his own account of his election in 1964. In A Question of Colour 1966, he said that he had no colour prejudice. In the book he considered South Africa to be a model of Parliamentary democracy and that Apartheid, if it could be separated from racialism, could well be an alternative to integration. Griffiths also blamed immigration from the Caribbean for the spread of disease.  Later life and career  In 1967, he became a lecturer in economics at Portsmouth College of Technology. After a year as an exchange professor in California, he returned to what became Portsmouth Polytechnic, until he returned to Parliament. Griffiths unsuccessfully stood for the Portsmouth North constituency at the February 1974 general election, but was elected for the seat at the 1979 general election. He held the constituency until the Labour landslide at the 1997 election, when he was defeated.  Personal life  Griffiths was married to Jeannette née Rubery; the couple had a son and daughter. Griffiths died on 20 November 2013, aged 85.  References   Bibliography  Griffiths, P. 1966. A Question of Colour? The Smethwick Election of 1964. London: Leslie Frewin. Pearce, R. 2004.

    "text": "The Suwannee River also spelled Suwanee River or Swanee River is a river that runs through south Georgia southward into Florida in the Southern United States. It is a wild blackwater river, about 246 miles 396 km long. The Suwannee River is the site of the prehistoric Suwanee Straits that separated the Florida peninsula from the Florida panhandle and the rest of the continent. Spelled as Swanee, it is the namesake of two famous songs: Stephen Fosters Swanee River 1851 and George Gershwin and Irving Caesars Swanee 1919.  Geography  The headwaters of the Suwannee River are in the Okefenokee Swamp in the town of Fargo, Georgia. The river runs southwestward into the Florida Panhandle, then drops in elevation through limestone layers into a rare Florida whitewater rapid. Past the rapid, the Suwanee turns west near the town of White Springs, Florida, then connects to the confluences of the Alapaha River and Withlacoochee River. The confluences of these three rivers form the southern borderline of Hamilton County, Florida. The Suwanee then bends southward near the town of Ellaville, followed by Luraville, then joins together with the Santa Fe River from the east, south of the town of Branford. The river ends and drains into the Gulf of Mexico on the outskirts of Suwannee.  Etymology  The Spanish recorded the native Timucua name of Guacara for the river that would later become known as the Suwannee. Different etymologies have been suggested for the modern name. San Juan: D.G. Brinton first suggested in his 1859 Notes on the Floridian Peninsula that Suwannee was a corruption of the Spanish San Juan. This theory is supported by Jerald Milanich, who states that Suwannee developed through San Juan-ee from the 17th century Spanish mission of San Juan de Guacara, located on the Suwannee River. Shawnee: The migrations of the Shawnee Shawnee: Shaawanwaki; Muscogee: Sawanoke throughout the South have also been connected to the name Suwannee. As early as 1820, the Indian agent John Johnson said the Suwaney river was doubtless named after the Shawanoese Shawnee, Suwaney being a corruption of Shawanoese. However, the primary southern Shawnee settlements were along the Savannah River, with only the village of Ephippeck on the Apalachicola River being securely identified in Florida, casting doubt on this etymology. Echo: In 1884, Albert S. Gatschet claimed that Suwannee derives from the Creek word sawani, meaning echo, rejecting the earlier Shawnee theory. Stephen Boyds 1885 Indian Local Names with their Interpretation and Henry Gannetts 1905 work The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States repeat this interpretation, calling sawani an Indian word for echo river. Gatschets etymology also survives in more recent publications, often mistaking the language of translation. For example, a University of South Florida website states that the Timucuan Indian word Suwani means Echo River ... River of Reeds, Deep Water, or Crooked Black Water. In 2004, William Bright repeats it again, now attributing the name Suwanee to a Cherokee village of Sawani, which is unlikely as the Cherokee never lived in Florida or south Georgia. This etymology is now considered doubtful: 2004s A Dictionary of Creek Muscogee does not include the river as a place-name derived from Muscogee, and also lacks entries for echo and for words such as svwane, sawane, or svwvne, which would correspond to the anglicization Suwannee. Kikongo language: According to Larry Eugene Rivers, the name Suwanee could be derived from the Bantu word nsubwanyi, translating to my house, my home among the Black Seminoles in Florida who spoke an Afro-Seminole Creole and established settlements along the Suwanee river.  History  The Suwannee River area has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. During the first millennium it was inhabited by the people of the Weedon Island culture, and around the year 900 a derivative local culture known as the Suwanee River Valley culture developed. By the 16th century, the river was inhabited by two closely related Timucua-speaking peoples: the Yustaga, who lived on the west side of the river; and the Northern Utina, who lived on the east side. By 1633, the Spanish had established the missions of San Juan de Guacara, San Francisco de Chuaquin, and San Augustin de Urihica along the Suwannee to convert these western Timucua peoples. In the 18th century, Seminoles lived by the river. During the colonial period into the antebellum era, Black Seminoles lived near the river and allied with the Seminoles during times of war. The steamboat Madison operated on the river before the Civil War, and the sulphur springs at White Springs became popular as a health resort, with 14 hotels in operation in the late 19th century.  Swanee River  The Suwanee given as Swanee is the locale of the protagonists longed-for home in two famous songs: Stephen Fosters 1851 Old",

    "text": "Ooh La La in L.A. is a song by English rock band Slade, released in 1987 as the third single from their fourteenth studio album, You Boyz Make Big Noize. The song was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and was produced by John Punter.  Background  Slade began writing and recording material for their You Boyz Make Big Noize album in 1986. Hoping to record a hit album that would put them back in the public eye, You Boyz Make Big Noize was released in 1987, however both the album and its singles Still the Same and Thats What Friends Are For all failed to achieve the expected level of commercial success. During the summer of 1987, Ooh La La in L.A. was released as the albums third single, but mainly in Germany only, with CBS also releasing it in America as a promotional single. It was not a commercial success in Germany and did not achieve enough airplay on American radio, except in Los Angeles, to warrant CBS giving it a full release. The song would be Slades last release through RCA Records. Ooh La La in L.A. had been written during the time of the bands 1985 album Rogues Gallery. The lyrics, written by Holder, details the bands experiences in America while promoting their 1984 hit single Run Runaway. The song also refers to the brief headline news that drummer Don Powell was dating Bob Dylans daughter. In a 1987 fan club interview, guitarist Dave Hill picked the song as his favourite from the album, stating: There is something about the chorus on this one. It is a very different sort of song for Slade. The lyric is very autobiographical. One verse is about Don being pissed all the time. There is mention of the Sunset Marquee, where a lot of bands stay. There is a verse about Barneys Beanery, where we used to play pool all the time. In Russia, Ooh La La in L.A. remains one of the bands most popular songs. In a 2011 interview on Vintage TV, Hill said: Ooh La La in L.A. was never a hit for us, but in Russia its huge. And its a bit like how come its huge in this massive country and yet it didnt happen here?  Release  Ooh La La in L.A. was released on 7 and 12 vinyl by RCA Records across Europe. In America, it was released as a promotional-only 12 vinyl. RCA also released the single as a promotional-only release in Mexico, while a Japanese promotional single was also released, featuring Ooh La La in L.A. as the A-side and American band Autographs Loud and Clear on the B-side. The B-side on the German release was Dont Talk to Me About Love, which had previously appeared as a B-side on the double pack edition of the bands Still the Same single. On the 12 single, a second B-side, Thats What Friends Are For, taken from You Boyz Make Big Noize, was also included. The artwork for the single was the same as used for the earlier 1987 single Thats What Friends Are For.  Promotion  A music video to promote the single in America was planned if the promotional single gained sufficient airplay to warrant a full release of the single. In a fan club newsletter of the time, it was revealed that the video would be filmed in Los Angeles. However, the video did not come to fruition, with Lea stating in a 1987 fan club interview: Well, when you are dealing with record companies, it all comes down to money, power strokes and the way they think a record is going to go. CBS deliberately held back on doing the video because, although they could see it picking up a few heavyweight stations, they wanted to wait to see if it picked up any more. In the UK, the band performed the song on the ITV show Get Fresh in August 1987, while promoting their UK-only single You Boyz Make Big Noize.  Critical reception  Upon its release in the US, the radio trade magazine The Hard Report selected Ooh La La in L.A. as one of the frontrunners for radio play and considered it to show a whole new side to the band. They noted Holders distinctive delivery which almost offers a Collinsesque twist this time around and added, One has to marvel at how the vocal equivalent of the Grand Canyon can seemingly add even more gravel, complete with newfound trills, which weve certainly heard before. The reviewer concluded, Its got to be their widest demo offering ever, with a pop hook you know will cause havoc on both sides of the dial. An easy call for their biggest hit of the 80s. FMQB picked it as a sure shot and commented that, like their 1984 hits Run Runaway and My Oh My, the 1987 model of the mighty Slade machine hones in on roundhouse melodies, flawless production, and a sound that rocks but doesnt crunch. They noted the Roxanne-like rhythm guitar chords, Holders rabble-rousing voice and lyrics which take a witty look at life on the road in America from a Brits perspective. The magazine concluded, Slade just turned 21, and its hard-driving, good-humored boyz noize like this thats made them one of the most durable bands of t",

Although every Macys has such a department, only the larger flagships have basement-level space devoted to the Cellar concept. The concept was pioneered in 1971 as a gourmet kitchenware marketing concept in the San Francisco flagship store of the Macys West division. In 1974, the Macys West president Edward Finkelstein was promoted to the president of Macys New York and brought the Cellar concept with him. The Cellar theme covers appliances, fixtures, kitchenware, and tableware. Macys stocks a wide range of brands in the cellar, including upscale and gourmet brands, as well as two private labels: Tools of the Trade for cookware, cutlery, and kitchen gadgets; and The Cellar for flatware, dinnerware, and glassware. Finkelstein acknowledged that The Cellars design was influenced by other stores including Harrods, Pottery Barn, and Crate  Barrel. In August 2006, the Chicago flagships basement level transitioned to this concept in preparation from the September Marshall Fields conversion. It did so by posting the themed logos as pictured in its housewares department.  References",

    "text": "Complimentary elections for acting Federal Councilors of Switzerland members of the Swiss Government to the National Council lower chamber of the Swiss Parliament were held in the second half of the 19th century. They were meant to underline the popular support of the Federal Councilors which were elected by the National Councilors. In practice, the Federal Councilors did not take office as National Councilors after being elected but resigned and kept acting as Federal Councilors. The practice of complimentary elections began in 1854 and was discontinued in 1896.  Name  The name Complimentary election was coined in 1881 by Simon Kaiser, a member of the National Council from Solothurn. Before it was also called a Confidence Vote, or Courtesy Election as with these elections, the people of the canton of origin of the Federal Councilor were able to show the popular support which the Federal Councilor was able to count on.  Context  Article 77 of the Swiss Constitution mentions that neither members of the Council of States upper chamber of the Swiss Parliament nor members of the Federal Council Swiss Government are allowed to be also members of the National Council. Article 96 mentions that every citizen able to elected into the National Council can also be elected into the Federal Council. The same article also regulates that the Federal Council is to be newly elected after every election of the National Council. The Federal Councilors were not formally elected by the Swiss citizens, but the members of the National Council. If the Federal Councilor did not win the complimentary election, he was likely not going to be confirmed for another term by the National Council.  History  The practice of the Complimentary Elections began in 1854. Simon König introduced a motion into the National Council aiming to achieve a revision of the electoral law which would prohibit the Federal Councilors election into the National Council. Kaiser reasoned that the possibility of such an election was unconstitutional. His motion was mainly directed against by the candidacy to the National Council of the Solothurnese Federal Councilor Bernhard Hammer. The Federal Council responded in 1883 attempting to explicitly allow such elections. In March 1885, the issue was discussed in the National Council and its respective commission was also in favor to adapt the laws accordingly, but the law was eventually dismissed by the National Council and also the Council of States didnt raise the issue again. As the beginning of the end of the practice is seen the non-candidacy in 1887 by Adolf Deucher, from the Canton Thurgau. In later years, other Federal Councilors followed his example and also declined to become a candidate. The last candidate to the Complimentary Elections was Adrian Lachenal in 1896.  Notable examples   Stefano Franscini  In the 1854 elections to the National Council, Federal Councilor Stefano Franscini was not elected in his Canton of Ticino, who then was put forward as a candidate in the Canton of Schaffhausen, with members of his party strongly supporting his political positions. In Schaffhausen, he was elected and following also re-elected as Federal Councilor by the National Council.  Ulrich Ochsenbein  The Federal Councilor Ulrich Ochsenbein lost to Jakob Stämpfli in October 1854, who then in December the same year was elected into the Federal Council by the Nacional Council instead to Ochsenbein.  Wilhelm Naeff  Wilhelm Naeff was more lucky, as after he was not able to win the elections in 1866, he just didnt become a candidate in the next elections and was re-elected to the Federal Council anyway, even though with slim margins.  Josef Martin Knüsel  Josef Martin Knüsel was a candidate in 1866, 1869, 1872 and 1875. Until the last time, he won all elections comfortably, but in the last one he lost and resigned before awaiting the verdict of the National Council.  References",

    "text": "EagleAI NETwork pronounced Eagle Eye is an electoral roll management system that conservative activists use to file mass challenges to voter registration in the United States. It is considered an alternative to the bipartisan, non-profit Electronic Registration Information Center ERIC which is run by professional election administrators. Critics describe EagleAI as a way for private citizens to challenge voter registrations using reliable data that highlights issues that professional election workers would not know to dismiss, improving the overall process. NBC News describes the tool as voter fraud vigilantism. Cleta Mitchell, former legal advisor to Donald Trump and founder of the Election Integrity Network, is associated with the nationwide attempt to rollout EagleAI as a replacement for ERIC. Unlike ERIC, EagleAI does not actually use artificial intelligence, as the AI in its name is intended to be pronounced as eye.  Background  In January 2022, The Gateway Pundit, a far-right fake news website responsible for promoting Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories, Parkland high school shooting conspiracy theories, and COVID-19 misinformation, began spreading election conspiracy theories claiming that the non-profit Electronic Registration Information Center ERIC was inaccurate and favored registered Democrats. ERIC is a bipartisan collaboration between Republicans and Democrats to maintain the accuracy of voter registration. In response to these conspiracy theories, nine states run by Republicans withdrew from ERIC. President Donald Trump later joined in on the attack on ERIC, calling it, according to Politico, a liberal plot to control the countys voter rolls. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows later described the right-wing attack on ERIC as a disinformation campaign. An analysis by NPR news in 2023 concluded that the Gateway Pundit was the instigator for the entire ERIC controversy. Michael Waldman of the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law notes that after the Gateway Pundit spread this rumor about ERIC and GOP-led states began withdrawing from participation, conservative activist Cleta Mitchell began promoting the use of EagleAI in place of the ERIC system. Mitchell is notable for trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results.  Creation  In response to concerns about the 2020 election, retired physician John W. Rick Richards, and his son John Richards created EagleAI pronounced Eagle Eye in 2022 in Augusta, Georgia. USA Today reported that Richards said he was motivated to create the program when he downloaded the Georgia secretary of states voter rolls and allegedly found people who should not have voted. When questioned about this alleged voter fraud, Richards was unable to provide evidence to support it and said he no longer has the records. Richards says he named the program after the Eagle Scouts, a prestigious rank in the Boy Scouts of America. When asked about the resemblance to Operation Eagle Eye, a voter suppression campaign run by the Republican National Committee in the 1960s to help Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election, Richards denied any connection.  Description  Richards states that EagleAI is a non-partisan tool used to review voter lists. Unlike ERIC, which relies on accurate and reliable government-provided data, EagleAI uses public data and connects with Republican groups like the Voter Reference Foundation VoteRef which reveals voter information. In promotional literature, EagleAI previously claimed to use AI and multitiered algorithms to run its program, but Richards later admitted that there is no AI involved. EagleAI flags voter registrations for what it calls irregularities, which then delivers the alerts to GOP activists who submit the registration challenges to local voting officials on an election board. The Associated Press reported that the database of suspicious voters is created by conservative activists.  Election Integrity Network  Senior legal fellow Cleta Mitchell of the Conservative Partnership Institute CPI, a former legal advisor to Donald Trump, was the founder of the Election Integrity Network. Compass Legal Group, the in-house legal compliance firm for CPI, and one in which Mitchell is a beneficial owner of, helped filed paperwork for Valid Vote, a non-profit arm of EagleAI. According to The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, Richards, EagleAIs CEO, frequently speaks during Zoom calls hosted by Cleta Mitchell. Mitchell worked with the North Carolina Election Integrity Team NCEIT in March 2023 to host a demonstration of EagleAI. According to NBC News, Jim Womack of NCEIT said Mitchell was working with Richards directly on the programs national rollout plan. In 2024, The Guardian independently confirmed Mitchells direct relationship with EagleAI when it was able to review training videos. They reported that",

In 1955 the club entered into professional football in the Tweede Divisie, but failed to make a breakthrough in the local football fanbase, experiencing very low turnouts during those years. Such issues, coupled with a budget far lower than all other professional clubs, led the Dutch Football Federation to exclude Baronie from the league in 1971. Since then, Baronie has played at amateur level, winning six times the Hoofdklasse title.

Dent, the owner of the Everymans Library. It was based on another foundry-type made for this publisher. Both founts were based on an old Venetian roman type made by Nicolas Jenson. The typeface was launched in 1912 in a collection of the poems of Lorenzo De Medici which was published by Ballantyne Press. This font was also the basis for William Morris and his Golden Type. Dent admired Morris and his Golden type, and the way Morris tried to implement his ideas on printing. Dent however wanted to use machines to produce the type for his trade editions for his Everymans Library. In this way he was able to take Morriss socialist principles in a more practical way, compared with the bibliophile editions of the Klemscott press. The font Monotype produced was almost a copy of Golden Type, but with sharper slab serifs, and cleaner lines. A lighter version was produced in 1919 after the First World War, with bracketed serifs, and named Italian Old Style series 108. In 1967 Series 59 was taken out of production and all patterns, designs and punches were destroyed. After this date no new mats could be made, although Series 108 is still available. However, several digital fonts based on Veronese are currently available.  References",

    "text": "Serge Brignoni 12 October 1903  6 January 2002 was a Swiss avant-garde painter and sculptor. His collection of ethnic art is now housed in the Museo delle Culture in Lugano.  Early life and education  Brignoni was born in October 1903 in the village San Simone near Chiasso to Romeo Brignoni and Cesira Muschetti. In 1907 he and his parents moved to Bern. At the age of fifteen, his interest into art developed after his father gave him some art magazines. Following Brignoni attempted to copy some of the works he saw. From 1919 onwards, he attended the School of Arts and Crafts in Bern, where he mainly studied art with Victor Surbek. In 1921, the family settled to Bellinzona where his father became the deputy director of the Swiss Post. Since he made trips to the nearby Milano in Italy, to study the buildings and museums of the city. He chose not to attend the art academy of Milano as he deemed it too conservative. He then continued his studies at the Academy of Arts, Berlin. In Berlin he visited the museums and got to know the German expressionism and Russian constructivism. In 1923 he went to study in Paris at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, where he met Alberto Giacometti, Picasso, and other avant-gardists, and where he was first exposed to African art.  Professional career  He worked at the Atelier 17 studio. He began collecting these artworks in 1926 and expanded the scope of his collecting to Melanesian and Indonesian art; he also supported himself in part through sales of these works. During this period he was also active in his own works, which were Surrealist and Primitivist in character. He joined Gruppe 33, an anti-Fascist association of artists based in Basel, and was represented in the 1935 and 1936 Surrealist exhibits in Copenhagen. He married Chilean painter Graciela Aranis 1906-1996 in 1935. In 1940 he was forced to return to Switzerland due to World War II, leaving his own work and his collection behind. Much of the former was lost to theft or destroyed, but the collection was held up by French customs, and was preserved intact, and at the end of the war he was able to retrieve it. He resumed his collecting after the war, eventually donating the collection to the city of Lugano in several phases beginning in 1985. He continued to work in a variety of media including sculpture, lithography, collage and painting; he also taught at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zürich. He painted several murals, including one at the Government Headquarters in Bellinzona 1958 and another in the television headquarters in Comano 1975. His works were widely exhibited, including a 1997 retrospective show at the Kunstmuseum Bern. He died in that city in 2002, survived by his second wife Marlyse Haller.  References",

It travels in a southeast-to-northwest path from the Virginia state line near Pennington Gap to the Indiana state line, on the Ohio River at Milton, Kentucky and Madison, Indiana.  Route description   Virginia state line to Manchester  US 421 enters Harlan County from Lee County, Virginia, and meets US 119 near Harlan. At Hyden, US 421 turns westward towards Clay County, and crosses the Hal Rogers Parkway via an overpass without access near Manchester.  Manchester to Richmond  At Manchester, US 421 turns northwestward towards Jackson County, through McKee. It traverses the far northeastern corner of Rockcastle County before entering Madison County where it joins U.S. 25 south of Richmond near the Blue Grass Army Depot. US 25 and US 421 runs concurrently through Richmond, and all the way to the I-75 junction.  Metro Lexington to Frankfort  US 25421 also runs concurrently with I-75 between Exits 97 and 99. After Exit 99, the two U.S. routes continue to run concurrently until downtown Lexington just after crossing US 276068.

Frankfort to Ohio River  In Frankfort, US 421 has concurrencies with US 60 on the east side of town, and US 127 on the north side. US 421 continues northwestward into Henry and far northern Shelby counties before crossing the Exit 34 exit of I-71. US 42 in Bedford is the last major intersection in Kentucky before US 421 crosses the Ohio River from Trimble County into Jefferson County, Indiana.  History  US 421 did not have any presence in Kentucky until it was extended into Kentucky and Indiana at one point between 1939 and 1957, probably in the late 1940s or early 1950s. When US 421 was designated into Kentucky, it was routed onto the following existing routes: KY 66 from the Virginia state line to Harlan, KY 257 from Harlan to Hyden, KY 80 from Hyden to Manchester, KY 21 from Manchester to Big Hill, KY 169 from Big Hill to Richmond including US 25 concurrency, KY 50 from downtown Lexington to Frankfort, and KY 37 from Frankfort to the Indiana state line at Milton.

Mark Izen founded the company in 1995; its online presence first appeared early in 2000. Despite being officially based in Boston, Massachusetts, at its peak First Act maintained offices in Bentonville, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen, and a custom shop luthiery in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 2016, First Act was acquired by toy manufacturer Jazwares.  Founding  First Act was largely an unrelated result of the successful sale of Duracraft to the Consumer Products division of Honeywell in 1996. Bernard Chiu, the founder of Duracraft, was offered a leadership role at First Act, Inc. after selling his company; he accepted, thus establishing the companys leadership hierarchy. As a significant portion of First Act, Inc. leadership were previous Duracraft employees, there were no dedicated musicians. Instead, they relied on their experience with generic commodity-level small appliances.  Product lines  The companys products were divided into two lines, with very similar entries but sold toward different audiences. They were marketed through large retail chains, particularly Toys R Us and Target, as well as Amazon.com. First Act proper was shaped toward inexpensive beginner instruments intended for children and adults. The small range was primarily a basic three-piece drum kit, a soprano ukulele, three dynamic-type microphones, and five guitars, both full-size acoustic and electric and short-scale marketed both as sized for kids and as a travel guitar. Paralleling this line was First Act Discovery sometimes just Discovery, musical products for children ages 3 to 9. This line included acoustic guitars, ukuleles, drums, electronic percussion pads, tambourines, recorders, keyboards, and electronic button-controlled guitars. There was also a series of plastic microphone-like products, largely with sounds and graphics licensed from Disney, including Nickelodeon, DreamWorks, and Marvel properties. More recently, to maximize the ukulele fad, a series of Disney-graphic instruments albeit marketed as mini guitars was released, such as the AV285 Avengers uke. An ambitious series of projects and products was eliminated after First Acts 2012 peak. First Act Instruments  the original retail line of entry-level instruments for teens and adults, including guitars, drums, hand percussion, and accessories.

The line was sold through Target stores. Fuel  successor to First Act Instruments, intended to distance this chain store presence largely Walmart and Target from the companys expanding quality lines. Studio For Artists SFA  designed and built custom guitars and violins for professional musicians. Each instrument was handcrafted, and finished in First Acts Boston studio. SFA Edition Guitars  standard First Act guitars with added custom appointments, such as premium pickups, upgraded machine heads, and unique pickguards.

Guitar Player magazine praised the instruments for their stylistic innovation, unique appearance and excellent workmanship.  Related facilities  First Act Guitar Studio was a real-world storefront at 745 Boylston Street, Boston, offering various First Act Custom, Limited Edition, SFA Edition, and First Act series electric and acoustic guitars, and accessories. Customers could play the guitars, watch a luthier crafting custom guitars, see a live show, or have their guitar serviced.

    "text": "Rio Chinese: RIO锐澳鸡尾酒 is a Chinese ready to drink alcopop beverage brand conceived in 2003 and manufactured by Shanghai Bacchus Limited Company, an arm of Shanghai Bairun Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd. Chinese: 百润股份, SZSE: 002568. Rio is a member of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association, and was inducted in 2010. Along with Breezer, Rio is one of the largest alcopop producers in China where both the brands share a combined two-thirds of the alcopop market in China. Rio generated revenue of 365 million yuan US59 million in the first half of 2014. In 2016, Bacchus reached a partnership with Veolia Water Technologies China.  Background and naming  The founder of Rio was present at a wine tasting event in Singapore. However, in the 1990s, most alcohol brands used only single wine-based ingredients. He was puzzled by the few types of juices that could form a good taste with alcohol. He then studied chuhai cocktails in Japan to suit the tastebuds of Asians before launching the product in 2003. Unlike its Japanese counterparts, Rio was sold in glass bottles instead of aluminium cans as the founder believed that cocktails are better received by consumers when packaged in glass. The brand was given the name Rio to evoke the tropical feel of Brazils Rio de Janeiro.  Marketing  Rio is the title sponsor for multiple Chinese dramas, movies and variety shows. Rios products are endorsed in the shows, which include drama Boss  Me, Love O2O, top variety show Keep Running and many more. Yang Yang and Amber Kuo are currently the spokespersons for Rio, succeeding Zhou Xun.  Lawsuit  In 2017, Bacchus filed an action with the Beijing Dongcheng District Peoples Court against Tonghua Dongte Wine Co., Ltd. for unfair competition in which the former claims of Dongtes BIO series has infringed its RIO series appearance and packaging. The court hearing rendered Bacchus with compensations of RMB 3 million in damages.  References",

    "text": "Lustration in Central and Eastern Europe is the official public procedure of scrutinizing a public official or a candidate for public office in terms of their history as a witting confidential collaborator informant of relevant former communist secret police, an activity widely condemned by the public opinion of those states as morally corrupt due to its essential role in suppressing political opposition and enabling persecution of dissidents. Surfacing of evidence for such a past activity typically inflicts severe damage to the reputation of the person concerned. It should not be confused with decommunization, which is the process of barring former communist regular officials from public offices as well as eliminating communist symbols. The principle of non-retroactivity means that a past role of a confidential collaborator informant is alone as such inadmissible from the beginning for criminal prosecution or conviction, thus, lustration allows at least to bring such past collaborators to moral responsibility by making the public opinion aware of the established outcomes through their free dissemination. Another motivation was the fear that undisclosed past confidential collaboration could be used to blackmail public officials by foreign intelligence services of other former Warsaw Pact allies, in particular Russia. Depending on jurisdiction, either every positive result or only the one obtained regarding a person who falsely declared otherwise may trigger consequences varying greatly among jurisdictions, ranging from mere infamy to purging the person from office and a 10-year exclusion from holding public offices. Various forms of lustration were employed in post-communist Europe.  Etymology  Lustration in general is the process of making something clear or transparent, usually by means of a propitiatory offering. The term is taken from the ancient Roman lustratio purification rituals.  Policies and laws  After the fall of the various European Communist governments with the Revolutions of 1989 between 1989 and 1992, government-sanctioned policies of mass disqualification of those associated with the abuses under the prior regime were initiated as part of the wider decommunization campaigns. Lustration in turn targets former confidential informants of the communist secret police who remain in or apply for political positions or even civil service positions, rather than former communist regular officials. In some countries, however, lustration laws did not lead to indiscriminate exclusion and disqualification, taking into account that people were often blackmailed to become informants or coerced into providing information without realising its true recipient. Lustration law in Hungary 19942003 was based on the exposure of compromised state officials, while lustration law in Poland 19992005 depended on confession. Lustration law is a special public employment law that regulates the process of examining whether a person holding certain higher public positions collaborated confidentially with the repressive apparatus of the communist regime. The special nature of lustration law refers to its transitional character. As of 1996, various lustration laws of varying scope were implemented in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, Poland, and Romania. As of 2019, lustration laws had not been passed in Belarus, nor in former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Central Asian Republics Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.  Results  Lustration can serve as a form of punishment by anti-communist politicians who were dissidents under a Communist-led government. Lustration laws are usually passed right before elections, and become tightened when right-wing governments are in power, and loosened while social-democratic parties are in power. It is claimed that lustration systems based on dismissal or confession might be able to increase trust in government, while those based on confession might be able to promote social reconciliation. There are, however, some paradoxal side effects of the process. For example, in spite of the fact that some informants were coerced or blackmailed into collaboration and may thus be also considered victims themselves, or in some cases despite terminating later the collaboration in favor of genuine dissident activity, the public attention and condemnation has focused primarily on them rather than on the communist government officials or secret police officers. Moreover, if the past collaboration is contested in a court, the verdict depends to some extent on testimonies of former communist secret police officers who engaged with the alleged informant, thus making those orchestrating the repressions de facto the ones deciding the case.  Examples   In Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic  Unlike many neighbouring states, the new government in the Czech and Slovak Fede",

    "text": "Bao Bolong also Baobolong, Bao Bolon or Baobolon Wetland Reserve is a protected area in The Gambia. Established in 1996, it covers 296.5 square kilometres. The Wetland Reserve is located on the north bank of the River Gambia, approximately 100 km 52 nautical miles from the river mouth. The name is derived from the Bao Bolon tributary that rises in Senegal and enters the River Gambia. It extends from the River Gambia north to the Senegalese border along the Baobolon tributary.  History  On 1 January 1993, an area of 35 km2 was first declared as Bao Bolong National Reserve. From 16 September 1996 on, it has covered an extended area of 220 km2 200 km2 according to other sources. It was the first reserve in the Gambia to be acknowledged as a wetland area worthy of protection according to the Ramsar Convention. Since 1975, this convention, whose draft had been initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO, protects the habitat of water birds and Charadriiformes. For other nature reserves in the country, such as Tanbi Wetland Complex or Niumi National Park NNP, a Ramsar acknowledgement is also being aimed at by the Gambian authorities. As with NNP, it is intended to extend Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve across the border and to jointly administrate the area with Senegalese authorities.  Geography  The reserve features a length of 22 kilometres and an approximate width of nine km. The western part is located in the Central Baddibu district while the eastern part adheres to Upper Baddibu, both of which belonging to the North Bank Division. Chiefly, the reserve is made up of the river Bao Bolongs estuary, one of the bigger tributaries of the river Gambia. It is located about 100 km away from the Gambias mouth into Atlantic Ocean. The roughly 100 km long Bao Bolong rivers spring is situated in Senegal. Furthermore, BBWR includes the rivers Salokini Bolong, Mandon Bolong, Duntu Malang Bolong, Tanku Bolong and Katchang Bolong. The Gambia river thereby formes the southern boundary of the protected area. Approximately two kilometres away on the opposite bank of the river, the roughly 115 km2 large Kiang West National Park is located. A some two and a half kilometres wide zone of dense mangrove forest adjoins to the river. To the west lies the town of Salikenne population about 4,000, which is also located near the Dobo Forest Park of 7.32 km2. At the western border, the Jalabiro Forest Park of 0.59 km2 can moreover be found. The northern edge is bordered by the north bank road, Gambias secondmost important highway. Along this road and the fork to Salikenne, several smaller towns like Nja Kunda, Minti Kunda, Kekuta Kunda, No Kunda, Konti Kunda Sukoto, Konti Kunda Nji and Illiassa are situated. In the east, following a fork of nine km length from the north bank road, the town of Katchang of 1,700 residents can be reached. Farafenni, with a population of more than 30,000 being the divisions largest city, lies roughly 18 km outside the outer limits of BBWR to the east. Summed up, there are 25 small towns which are situated at the wetland reserves boundaries, one among them being inside the park limits proper. The inhabitants of these towns conduct fishery for personal requirements and their stock graze inside BBWR. Furthermore, they collect timber and fire wood there. The terrain is flat, the highest elevation is cited with 12 metres above mean sea level.  Flora and fauna   Ecosystems  Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve includes a rich fauna and flora within multiple ecosystems. Important, protected tree species are pointed out by the Ramsar Information Sheet, such as Pterocarpus erinaceus, Parinari macrophylla, the ana tree, wild mango trees Cordyla africana and Néré Parkia biglobosa.  Mangroves  Only in the mangrove forest of Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve the mangrove trees of the Senegambia region reach a height of 20 metres. The species Rhizophora racemosa, red mangrove Rhizophora mangle and black mangrove Avicennia germinans are widespread among them.  Saltmarsh  In the salt marshes, e.g. the succulent Sesuvium portulacastrum and grasses like Sporobolus spicatus, Paspalum vaginatum as well as Diplachne fusca can be found. In the savanna, which at times is flooded, Phragmites karka, Echinochloa pyramidalis and paper reed are very common.  Savanna  In the savanna, trees like Daniellia oliveri, Terminalia albida, Bombax costatum and others are to be found. Among the shrubs one will encounter several species of figs, Physostigma thonningii, Terminalia avicennioides, Anthostema senegalense and Nauclea latifolia. For grasses, Andropogon tectorum and Gamba grass Andropogon gayanus, Beckeropsis uniseta and Pennisetum subangustum are common.  Birds  The Gambia is frequently visited by ornithologists as more than 540 species of birds have been described there in topic literature. The reserve has been desig",

Types  Spalting is divided into three main types: pigmentation, white rot, and zone lines. Spalted wood may exhibit one or all of these types in varying degrees. Both hardwoods deciduous and softwoods coniferous can spalt, but zone lines and white rot are more commonly found on hardwoods due to enzymatic differences in white rotting fungi. Brown rots are more common to conifers, although one brown rot, Fistulina hepatica beefsteak fungus, is known to cause spalting among deciduous trees.  Pigmentation  Pigmentation is caused when fungi produce extracellular pigments inside wood. Bluestain is also a form of pigmentation; however, bluestain pigments are generally bound within the hyphae cell walls. A visible color change can be seen if enough hyphae are concentrated in an area. Pigmenting fungi classified as spalting fungi do decay wood, they simply do so at a slower rate soft rotting than white rotting fungi. The most common groups of pigmentation fungi are the imperfect fungi and the ascomycetes. Mold fungi, such as Trichoderma spp., are not considered to be spalting fungi, as their hyphae do not colonize the wood internally and they do not produce the enzymes necessary to digest the wood cell wall components.  White rot  The mottled white pockets and bleaching effect seen in spalted wood is due to white rot fungi. Primarily found on hardwoods, these fungi bleach by consuming lignin, which is the slightly pigmented area of a wood cell wall. Some white rotting can also be caused by an effect similar to pigmentation, in which the white hyphae of a fungus, such as Trametes versicolor Fr. Pil., is so concentrated in an area that a visual effect is created. Both strength and weight loss occur with white rot decay, causing the punky area often referred to by woodworkers. Brown rots, the unpleasing type of spalting, do not degrade lignin, thus creating a crumbly, cracked surface which cannot be stabilized. Both types of rot, if uncontrolled, will render wood useless.  Zone lines  Dark dotting, winding lines and thin streaks of red, brown and black are known as zone lines. This type of spalting does not occur due to any specific type of fungus, but is instead an interaction zone in which different fungi have erected barriers to protect their resources. They can also be caused by a single fungus delineating itself. The lines are often clumps of hard, dark mycelium, referred to as pseudosclerotial plate formation. Zone lines themselves do not damage the wood. However, the fungi responsible for creating them often do. Spalted wood is also sometimes known as web wood.  Conditions  Conditions required for spalting are the same as the conditions required for fungal growth: fixed nitrogen, micronutrients, water, warm temperatures and oxygen. Water: Wood must be saturated to a 20 moisture content or higher for fungal colonization to occur. Wood placed underwater lacks sufficient oxygen, and colonization cannot occur. Temperature: The majority of fungi prefer warm temperatures between 10 and 40 C, with rapid growth occurring between 20 and 32 C. Oxygen: Fungi do not require much oxygen, but conditions such as waterlogging will inhibit growth. Time: Different fungi require different amounts of time to colonize wood. Research conducted on some common spalting fungi found that Trametes versicolor, when paired with Bjerkandera adusta, took eight weeks to spalt 1.5 inch 38 mm cubes of Acer saccharum. Colonization continued to progress after this time period, but the structural integrity of the wood was compromised. The same study also found that Polyporus brumalis, when paired with Trametes versicolor, required 10 weeks to spalt the same size cubes.  Commonly spalted woods  The Ohio Department of Natural Resources found that pale hardwoods had the best ability to spalt. Some common trees in this category include maple Acer spp., birch Betula spp. and beech Fagus spp.. However, recent research suggests that sugar maple Acer saccharum and aspen Populus sp. are preferred by both white rot and pigment fungi.  Common spalting fungi  One of the trickier aspects to spalting is that some fungi cannot colonize wood alone; they require other fungi to have preceded them to create favorable conditions. Fungi progress in waves of primary and secondary colonizers, where primary colonizers initially capture and control resources, change the pH of the wood and its structure, and then must defend against secondary colonizers that then have the ability to colonize the substrate. Ceratocystis spp. Ascomycetes contains the most common blue stain fungi. Other pigmenting fu",

The route serves to connect the rural communities of Cruso, Woodrow, and Bethel with the town of Canton entirely in Haywood County  Route description  NC 110 begins at the intersection of US 276 and NC 215 south of Canton. The road then runs north along Pisgah Drive. Shortly after the intersection the road crosses the Pigeon River and begins to parallel the river and NC 215. The road continues to run through a semi rural area until it reaches the town of Canton. Once reaching Canton the road continues to follow Pisgah Drive but makes a sharp left turn in the center of the city, as it reaches its northern terminus. Shortly after NC 110 reaches its northern terminus at US 19US 23.  History  NC 110 was first assigned as a bypass around the town of Newton. Shortly after the creation of the road US 70 was assigned to the entire length of the highway. In 1930 the road dissolved and was renumbered as NC 10A. The current NC 110 was built in 1932 as a new route stretching from NC 284 in Woodrow to US 19US 23NC 10 in Canton. Around 1938 NC 284 changed to the current routing of US 276.

    "text": "Barbara Mary Willard 12 March 1909  18 February 1994 was a British novelist best known for childrens historical fiction. Her Mantlemass Chronicles is a family saga set in 15th to 17th-century England. For one chronicle, The Iron Lily 1973, she won the annual Guardian Childrens Fiction Prize, a book award judged by panel of British childrens writers.  Life  Willard was born in Brighton, Sussex on 12 March 1909, the daughter of the Shakespearean actor Edmund Willard and Mabel Theresa Tebbs. She was also the great-niece of Victorian-era actor Edward Smith Willard. The young Willard was educated at a convent school in Southampton. Because of her family connections, Willard originally went on the stage as an actress and also worked as a playreader, but she was unsuccessful and abandoned acting in her early twenties. She wrote numerous books for adults before she turned to childrens literature. Very little about the author was written during her lifetime, because of her private nature. She died at a nursing home in Wivelsfield Green, East Sussex, on 18 February 1994.  Writing career  The Grove of Green Holly 1967, which was a story about a group of 17th century travelling players who were hiding in a forest in Sussex from Oliver Cromwells soldiers, spawned her most famous work, the Mantlemass series 19701981 including her Guardian Prize-winning book. Some other books were Hetty 1956, Storm from the West 1963, Three and One to Carry 1964, and Charity at Home 1965. One of her last books, The Forest - Ashdown in East Sussex, published by Sweethaws Press in 1989, gives a detailed account of Ashdown Forest. In the introduction to the book, Christopher Robin Milne notes that Willard had moved from her home on the Sussex Downs to the edge of Ashdown Forest in 1956 and that her new surroundings had provided the inspiration and setting for ten of her childrens historical novels eight in the Mantlemass series and two others. It is evident by her own account in her book that she actively involved herself in the affairs of the forest. She was a representative of the forest Commoners elected to the forests Board of Conservators in 1975, and she remained in that capacity for ten years. She tells how she was later heavily involved in the fundraising campaign which enabled East Sussex County Council to purchase the forest in 1988, enabling it to remain as a place of beauty and tranquility open to the public.

    "text": "The 1928 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1928 season. The 25th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League champion New York Yankees versus the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Yankees beat the Cardinals in four games to win their third championship and become the first team to do back-to-back sweeps. Babe Ruth hit .625 10 for 16 as the Yankees outscored their opponents by a combined score of 2710. As he had done against the Cards in the 1926 Series, Ruth hit three home runs over the right field pavilion in Sportsmans Park in Game 4, the only player to do it in two different World Series through the 2016 season. Unlike 1926, however, it occurred in the final game of a Series won by the Yanks and finished off their two consecutive World Series sweeps. Lou Gehrig also had a good Series, hitting .545 6 for 11 with four home runs. He drove in as many runs by himself 9 as the entire Cardinal team combined. His OPS of 2.433 is, through 2024, the highest World Series OPS of all time. Bill McKechnie became the second manager to lead two different teams to the World Series, and like Pat Moran before him, won one and lost one.  Background  Before the series started, Walter Johnson, a retired Major League pitcher at the time, reportedly predicted that the Cardinals would make short work of the New York Yankees, and that the Yankees hadnt looked good for a while. Both Cardinals and Yankees fans were looking forward to a rematch of the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won.  Summary  AL New York Yankees 4 vs. NL St. Louis Cardinals 0  Matchups   Game 1  In a fashion similar to 1926, Bill Sherdel took the mound in Game 1 for the Cardinals. Ruth doubled with 2 outs in the first inning. Gehrig followed with an RBI double. Ruth lashed another double in the fourth and scored ahead of Bob Meusels home run, one of only four hits off Sherdel in his seven innings. Consecutive singles by Mark Koenig, Ruth and Gehrig-for his second RBI-against Cards reliever Syl Johnson gave the Yankees the 4th run and a 10 series lead.  Game 2  The Cardinals produced 30 percent 3 of their runs in the Series in the second inning of game 2. George Harper walked, Jimmie Wilson doubled, Rabbit Maranville singled, and Grover Cleveland Alexander reached on second baseman Tony Lazzeris errant throw. It tied the game at 33. After that, George Pipgras allowed only two more Cardinal hits, walking 3 other St. Louis batters. Miller Huggins had helped him straighten out a delivery problem. Pipgras consistently struck out the Cardinals with his curveballs, and they didnt score again. New York went ahead 43 in the bottom of the second inning off Alexander, who did not do well after that. Ruth led off with a single. Gehrig, having homered earlier in the first inning to give the Yankees a 30 lead, drew a walk, and Meusel drove in a run with a double. A hit batsman and another run-scoring hit gave the Yankees a 4-run lead, and that was how it ended.  Game 3  The Redbirds, as the Cardinals were affectionately called by fans, led only 3 times the entire series and held an advantage in this game for 3 innings, the longest span in the series. They put up a 20 score in the 1st inning on singles by Andy High and Frankie Frisch, followed by a line drive that center fielder Cedric Durst couldnt catch, giving Jim Bottomley a 2-run double. The only other St. Louis run came in the 5th inning, when Taylor Douthit was hit by a pitch and scored to make it a 33 game on Highs double. Where the Cardinals had to scrape together runs, the Yankees did not. Gehrig homered into the right-field pavilion. In the fourth inning, Ruth laced a single and Gehrig followed with a hard line drive that skipped over the head of charging fielder Douthit. The ball rolled to the fence, and Gehrig went around the bases for a two-run inside-the-park homer. Ruth took to the bases again in the sixth inning when his grounder forced out Koenig. Gehrig then drew a walk. 3rd baseman High fielded Meusels bouncer and tried to start a double play. His throw got Gehrig at second, but Frischs relay went wild and rolled to the fence. As Bottomley scampered after the ball, Ruth rounded third base and headed for home. The throw beat him, and umpire Bill McGowan called him out, but the impact from Ruths hit in the collision jarred the ball loose from catcher Jimmie Wilson, and McGowan changed the call. Later in the inning, Meusel scored on a double steal. The Yankees scored another run that inning to make it 63. Another run in the seventh was their last of the game, making it 7-3.  Game 4  After Game 3, Cardinals manager Bill McKechnie was still hopeful, despite losing 3 games in a row. Itsic they can win three games, so can we. Nothing is impossible. And this thing isnt over until the fourth game is won, h",

    "text": "How to Make Trouble and Influence People ISBN 0958554927 is a self-published book from 1996 chronicling the history of political pranks and acts of creative subversion in Australia. The book consists of a series of short paragraphs describing incidents, as well as facsimiles of flyers, posters and graffiti. It also includes an interview with Greg Wadley, author of the zine Loser. The incidents detailed in How to Make Trouble date from the early colonial days to recent times, and include both explicitly political and non-political pranks. They include industrial disputes in the 1920s, recent environmental and anti-war protests, as well as acts of inspired vandalism and detournement. As such, this book can be said to be a testament to the larrikin tradition of Australia, and its numerous manifestations throughout history. Two sequels were released, How to Stop Whining and Start Living and Revenge of the Troublemaker. Each of these is attributed to the Question Mark Collective. It is believed that one of the compilers was Iain McIntyre. Iain McIntyre wrote and edited How to Make Trouble and Influence People: Pranks, Hoaxes, Graffiti, and Mischief-Making around Australia the most widely received installment in the series as well as maybe having edited Revenge of the Troublemaker: How to Make Trouble and Influence People Part 3 this has also led to him being the most, or even only, interviewed person related to these books. This puts him in a unique position to articulate the motive and ethos behind the books publications. Iain McIntyre is a writer and radio broadcaster from Melbourne, he has been involved in activism from the 1980s and still takes part in actions today. He has written and edited many books and pamphlets about Australias history and subversive cultures. McIntyre has also played several bands. Copies of these books may possibly be found in anarchist and countercultural bookshops in Australia. The book influenced the production of the ABC Radio Background Briefing program on Culture Jamming: How to Make Trouble and Influence People, broadcast in 1998 and also featured in Head Space No 4, the Australian Broadcasting Corporations monthly Arts and Culture Magazine. A collected and expanded version of all three of the original publications, How to Make Trouble and Influence People: Pranks, Hoaxes, Graffiti and Mischief-making from Across Australia ISBN 9780980415117 was collated by Iain McIntyre and Breakdown Press for release in October 2009.

    "text": "Frances McCollin October 24, 1892  February 25, 1960 was an American composer and musician, who was blind from early childhood. She was the first woman to win the Clemson Prize from the American Guild of Organists. In 1951, she was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania.  Early life and education  Frances McCollin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1892, the daughter of Edward Garrett McCollin and Alice Graham Lanigan McCollin. Her father, a lawyer, had studied musical composition in college, and he wrote and performed music as a side interest throughout his life. He was one of the founders of the Manuscript Music Society of Philadelphia. Her grandfather, George T. Lanigan, was an Irish-Canadian poet and journalist. Her younger sister, Katherine Williams McCollin Arnett, known as Kitty, was a singer and composer and the mother of Edward Arnett. When Frances McCollin was five years old, she became blind, probably from congenital glaucoma. Her parents and extended family took an energetic approach to her education at home, focused on music. When she started to compose in girlhood, her father was her first teacher and transcriber. As a child, she described sensations consistent with synaesthesia and perfect pitch. As a young woman she studied with fellow blind musician David Duffield Wood, the organist at St. Stephens Church in Philadelphia, and with William Wallace Gilchrist and H. Alexander Matthews at the Pennsylvania Institute for Instruction of the Blind.  Career  In her lifetime, McCollins works were performed frequently by professional and amateur vocal ensembles, and by orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Warsaw Philharmonic, the Vancouver Symphony, and others. She met Marian Anderson, Igor Stravinsky, Amy Beach, and other musicians and composers, usually in connection with her mothers work with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Fabien Sevitzky, Eugene Ormandy, and Leopold Stokowski took particular interest in her compositions. McCollin defended Stokowski programming The Internationale for a Philadelphia youth concert in 1934. Among the honors McCollin won a first prize from the Manuscript Music Society of Philadelphia in 1916, and the Philadelphia Matinee Musical Clubs annual prize in 1918. Also in 1918, she became the first woman to win the Clemson Prize from the American Guild of Organists, and the Kimball Company Prize from the Chicago Madrigal Club. In 1931 her composition Spring in Heaven won the Federation Prize from the National Federation of Music Clubs. In 1951, she was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania. She gave popular weekly lectures about the Philadelphia Orchestra programs, in which she focused on explaining modern compositions. She also hosted a weekly radio show for children, the Aunt Frances Music Hour. She conducted a girls choir at the School for the Blind in West Philadelphia, and the Girls Glee Club at Swarthmore College for one year 1923-1924. In 1943, the Philadelphia Orchestras Request Program featured works voted into the program by the public; Frances McCollins Pavane was included as a top vote-getter, the only winning composition by a woman.  Personal life  McCollin did earn some money from teaching, lecturing, and publishing royalties, but not enough to be financially independent. She never matured socially and intellectually; she was profoundly dependent on her family both financially and professionally. Throughout her life, she benefitted from transcription help from her family and from other local musicians including Vincent Persichetti, Jeanne Behrend, and Fabien Sevitzky who would go on to program her works when he conducted the Indianapolis Symphony. McCollin was in poor health in her last years, and lived with her sister Kitty who had married a doctor, John Hancock Arnett. When she died in 1960, aged 67 years, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra played a string quartet she composed at her memorial service. Her scores and other papers are archived at the Free Library of Philadelphia. Another collection of her papers is at the University of Pennsylvania.  Selected works  Among her compositions include: Now All the Woods Are Sleeping All Glory, Laud and Honor Christmas Fantasia, for organ Sleep, Holy Babe, for solo voice and string orchestra Come Hither, Ye Faithful, for choir Gods Miracle of May, trio for womens voices Pavane Spring in Heaven 1931 How Firm a Foundation, a chorale cantata based on the tune St. Denio 1943 Going Up to London, cantata for womens voices, flute obbligato, and piano accompaniment, text by Nancy Byrd Turner.

The scorecards of five important matches have survived and there are reports of other senior matches, including two single wicket events. Hampshire did much better than in 1773, and were unbeaten in their known results to the end of July but then they lost twice to Kent in August.  Single wicket  Records have survived of three matches played under single wicket rules. The first on 67 June was a five-a-side match between Hampshire and Kent at Moulsey Hurst for a stake of 100 guineas a side. Lumpy Stevens and Samuel Colchin played as given men for Hampshire and John Minshull as one for Kent. Hampshire scored 118 and 127; Kent scored 21 and 36. Hampshire won by 188 runs. Tom Sueter with 74 in the second Hampshire innings scored more than both innings of Kent on his own. The Kentish Gazette on 22 June advertised a single wicket match at Sevenoaks Vine on 27 June for 100 a side between the Kent professionals John Wood i.e., the bowler from Seal and William Bullen of Greenwich. The outcome was not reported. On the same day, there was a five-a-side match between teams called Middlesex and London on Marylebone Fields. The stakes here were 20.  Scorecards  The scorecards of five senior matches, all involving Hampshire, have survived. In these five, Hampshire played twice each against England and Kent. The fifth match was against Surrey. Limited information about other matches has been found in contemporary newspapers.  England v Hampshire   22 to 24 June  Scorecard : Hampshire v England. The first match between Hampshire and England was played 22 to 24 June on Broadhalfpenny Down. Hampshire won by an innings and 52 runs England batted first and were dismissed for 122, of which Minshull scored 37. Hampshire responded with 307. The scorecard shows that nine Hampshire batters reached double figures, and the other two both scored 9. Their top scorers were Sueter 67 and John Small 47. In their second innings, England were all out for 133, Minshull scoring 38, and so Hampshire gained an innings victory. Scores and Biographies has Laleham Burway as the venue, but research by The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians ACS has confirmed that it was Broadhalfpenny Down. No bowling or fielding details are known, but Hampshires attack was strengthened by the addition of star bowler Lumpy as a given man.  8 and 9 July  Scorecard : England v Hampshire. The return match was played 8 and 9 July on Sevenoaks Vine. Hampshire won by 169 runs. Hampshire, batting first, scored 139. James Aylward 29 and George Leer 28 were their top scorers. Bowling for England, William Bullen took five wickets, all bowled. This is the first time that a bowler can definitely be credited with the 5wI feat. England were all out for 88 after Lumpy, Thomas Brett, and Nyren took two wickets apiece. Hampshire, with a first innings lead of 51, extended this to 233 by scoring 182 in their second innings. Aylward scored 61 and Sueter scored 30. In their second innings, England were dismissed for 64, Lumpy taking four wickets. Hampshire were greatly helped by having Lumpy as a given man. Both of John Wood Kent and John Wood Surrey were playing for England. One of them made the top score of 27 in Englands first innings, and one of them took three second innings wickets they might well have shared the wickets. However, it was definitely John Wood of Surrey who took a catch in the first innings. This was the final appearance in known senior matches by John Frame, the Kent fast bowler who was held by John Nyren to have been the other principal with Lumpy i.e., in opposition to Hambledon. His greatest years were behind him when the statistical record began he would have been 39 in 1772. He started playing in 1749. The bulk of his career was through the 1750s and 1760s and Scores  Biographies records him bowling for DartfordKent when they beat England twice in 1759.  Surrey v Hampshire   28 July  Scorecard : Surrey v Hampshire. Hampshire played two matches against Surrey. A scorecard has survived from the first on 28 July at Guildford Bason. Hampshire won by 7 wickets. There was an outstanding fast bowling performance in this match by Hampshires Thomas Brett, who took at least nine wickets i.e., nine were bowled out. Surrey were dismissed for 61 and 77, Brett bowling five in the first innings and four in the second. His 5wI is the second on record after Bullens haul three weeks previously. Bretts match haul of nine was the highest on record at this time. Will Palmer batted well in Surreys first innings, and made 26. Hampshire scored 91 and 483.  27 September  The second match was on 27 September at Laleham Burway. The result is unknown. It was advertised on Saturday, 24 September in the St James Chronicle. The stakes were 100 a side, and Surrey were to have Sam",

    "text": "Patit Punjabi: ਪਤਤ Gurmukhi is a term which refers to a person who has been initiated into the Sikh religion, but violates the religions precepts and leaves it. The term is sometimes translated as apostate.  Description  Its legal definition as inserted in the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, through the amending Act XI of 1944:: Patit means a person who being a Keshdhari Sikh, trims or shaves his beard or keshas or who after taking amrit commits any one or more of the four kurahits. Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971, contains a similar definition except a reference to keshdhari because unlike Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, it defines only keshdhari, and not sahajdhari, as Sikhs. It states: Patit means a Sikh who trims or shaves his beard or hair keshas or who after taking amrit commits any one or more of the four kurahits. In the Sikh Rehat Maryada, Section Six, it states: The undermentioned four transgressions must be avoided: Dishonouring the hair; Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the Kutha way; Cohabiting with a person other than ones spouse; Using an intoxicant such as smoking, drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs or tobacco These four kurahit causes of apostasy were first listed by Guru Gobind Singh.

    "text": "Norah Elam, also known as Norah Dacre Fox née Norah Doherty, 5 March 1878  2 March 1961, was an Irish-born militant suffragette, anti-vivisectionist, feminist and fascist in the United Kingdom.  Early life  Norah Doherty was born on 5 March 1878 at 13 Waltham Terrace in Blackrock, Dublin to John Doherty, a partner in a paper mill, and Charlotte Isabel Clarke. She moved to England with her family and by 1891 was living in London. Norah married Charles Richard Dacre Fox in 1909.  Political activity  Norah Dacre Fox was a prominent member of the Womens Social and Political Union and, by 1913, served as general secretary. Dacre Fox was an effective propagandist, delivering rousing speeches at the WSPU weekly meetings and writing many of Christabel Pankhursts speeches. In May 1914 Flora Drummond and Norah Dacre Fox besieged the homes of Edward Carson and Lord Lansdowne, both prominent Ulster Unionist politicians who had been inciting militancy in Ulster against the Home Rule Bill then going through Parliament. Drummond and Dacre Fox had both been issued with summonses to appear before magistrates for making inciting speeches and encouraging women to militancy. Their response to journalists who interviewed them was that they thought they should take refuge with Carson and Lansdowne who had also been making speeches and encouraging militancy in Ireland, but who appeared to be safe from interference from the authorities for doing so. Both women appeared before a magistrate, were sentenced to imprisonment and taken to Holloway Prison where they immediately commenced hunger and thirst strikes and endured force-feeding. From May to July 1914 she was imprisoned three times in Holloway for acts of terrorism; she received a WSPU Hunger Strike Medal with three bars. In the 1918 United Kingdom general election she stood as an independent candidate in Richmond Surrey; she received 20 of the votes but was not elected. The same year she campaigned for the internment of enemy aliens in collaboration with the British Empire Union and the National Party. Norah Elam stated in The Times that she was never a member of the Womens Freedom League contrary to some reports. Elam was a member of the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society LPAVS. During 1916 and 1917, Elam obtained work as supervisor of a typewriting pool at the Medical Research Council MRC, gaining information she was to use in articles published under the auspices of the LPAVS during 1934 and 1935. In March 1921, Elam advertised in The Times and chaired a public meeting of LPAVS at the Aeolian Hall in London to discuss The Dogs Bill a bill to prohibit the vivisection of dogs that was being debated in Parliament at that time. In 1932, the MRC had produced a paper called Vitamins, A Survey of Present Knowledge. Elams 1934 response was entitled The Vitamin Survey, A Reply and was a critical appraisal of that survey and its results. This was followed in 1935 by The Medical Research Council, What it is and how it works based on the same arguments about MRC research practices and remits as the first paper, but distilled and argued more cogently on a broader front. Elams argument was that powerful vested interests had managed to entrench themselves behind State-aided research, and had managed to make themselves unaccountable. These papers were widely distributed and copies could be found in libraries throughout the UK. By the 1930s, she had separated from her husband, and was living with Edward Descou Dudley Vallance Elam whose surname she generally adopted. They lived in Sussex where they were active in the local Conservative Party. However they defected to Oswald Mosleys British Union of Fascists BUF soon after its creation in 1932 and she became prominent in the womens section. During this time, she encountered Wilfred Risdon, Director of Propaganda 19334, who was later a colleague in the LPAVS. She was a frequent contributor to the fascist press and in November 1936 was put forward as the BUFs prospective parliamentary candidate for the Northampton constituency, but no general election was held during the Second World War. Mosley used her suffragette past to counter the criticism that National Socialism was anti-feminist saying that her prospective candidacy killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back in the home. In May 1940 Norah and Dudley Elam were detained under Defence Regulation 18B and she was interned in Holloway Prison with several other female fascists including Diana Mosley. After her release, Norah and Dudley Elam escorted Unity Mitford to see Diana and Oswald Mosley in Holloway on 18 March 1943.  Family  Elam had one son, Evelyn born 1922. Her granddaughter, Angela McPherson, described in a 2010 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Mother Was a Blackshirt, that she had no idea until 2002 of the role Elam played in the fascist movement. McPherson",

    "text": "The Montsec Range Catalan: Serra del Montsec Catalan pronunciation: ˈsɛra ðel monˈsɛk; Spanish: Sierra del Montsec is a mountain system of the Pre-Pyrenees.  Description  The Serra del Montsec consists of a series of calcareous mountain ranges running roughly from east to west. The range system is about 40 km long and 186.96 square kilometres in area. The Montsec is located in the Catalan province of Lleida and the Aragonese province of Huesca in Spain.  Geography  The name Montsec derives from the Latin Montus sectus, which makes reference to its characteristic rock formations. It marks the southern limit of the Pallars region and is divided into three main massifs by 3 of the most important rivers in Catalonia: Montsec de Rúbies, the eastern massif, is separated by the river Segre in the east and the Noguera Pallaresa in the middle, Montsec dAres, the central massif. Montsec dEstall, in Aragon, located to the west, separated by the Noguera Ribagorçana from the central massif. Two gorges congostos, those of Terradets and Montrebei, or Bonremei, have been opened by the action of the rivers and tectonic movements. The highest peak, Santalís, is found in the central massif, standing at 1,678 metres, and dominates views over Àger and the plains of Lleida to the south and the Pyrenees to the north. The southern face is virtually a great wall with a step about two-thirds of the way up, and the northern side, although by no means as steep, still stands at 1,000 metres above the Tremp basin below.  Geographical features   Formation  Montsecs formation goes back to when sediments of several thousand metres deep were deposited in the Cretaceous sea, raised and partly covered by the Eocene sea, and then raised again by Pyrenean folding. Fossils from the Mesozoic era are relatively easy to find, and at Vilanova de Meià the deposits there are one of the most important in the world.  History  Montsec stands in a natural defensive position over the plains and is relatively protected from the icy winds from the north, and as such its strategic aspect was very important in times of the Reconquista. In the 10th century, when the caliphate of Córdoba was at its height, Balaguer was the northernmost Arab city, and the castles of Castelló de Farfanya, Algerri, and Os de Balaguer were satellite fortifications which, together with a barrier of well-placed watch towers, formed the line of defense against the Christians to the north of Montsec. In the 11th and 18th centuries the area had one of the densest populations in Catalonia, but the population level began to fall at the beginning of the 20th century, and nowadays emigration is prominent and many villages are virtually abandoned. It is an area of natural interest, due to its caves, Astronomical Park, and activities, including kayaking, hiking, paddle-surfing, and gliding.  Economy  The difficulty of irrigation makes for a very limited agriculture in the area. Local farmers cultivate mostly some barley and almonds. Hydroelectric power is another resource but most of all planners are looking to tourist development to give the region an important boost.

He was born at Craigs Station in Kentucky on 25 August 1782 while his father, John, was burying casualties of the Battle of Blue Licks. His family moved to Bracken County and he was educated at the Bracken Academy. He became a prosperous landowner and married Polly Hubbard in 1802. They had nine children starting with James. He moved his family to St Charles, Missouri in 1811 and built mills on the Big Piney River. When his wife died of tuberculosis in 1822, he became disconsolate and went adventuring with his son James. They engaged in trapping along the Gila and Colorado rivers, tried copper mining in Santa Rita, New Mexico and eventually wound up in San Diego where they were imprisoned by the Mexicans who then ruled California. Sylvester died in prison on 24 May 1828.  References",

    "text": "Mobilization for Justice MFJ  formerly MFY Legal Services, Inc. is a non-profit legal services and advocacy organization serving New York City. MFJ was founded in 1963 and became a model for using a holistic approach to community lawyering.  History  Mobilization for Justice has its roots in Mobilization for Youth MFY, a community-based social service initiative funded in 1962 by the Kennedy Administration, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Ford Foundation, and the City of New York, with the goal of enlisting the actionist and researcher in a joint program of social engineering organized to improve opportunities for youth and guide young people into pursuing them. MFY Legal Services, the legal unit of Mobilization for Youth was launched the following year in 1963 by Edward Sparer who advocated a new approach: Instead of piecemeal direct legal services in the Legal Aid tradition, most of MFY Legal Units resources should be channeled into targeted study and direct litigation designed to change the institutional structure that created and sustained poverty. He advocated the use of test cases as an early form of cause lawyering or impact litigation that would create new legal rights for the poor. Sparer identified specific issues in the welfare rights arena that were ripe for legal challenges including residency laws, violations of privacy, inadequate benefits and arbitrary welfare terminations  linking a litigation strategy to a social movement. MFY Legal Services became the prototype for storefront poverty law offices which opened in virtually every major American city. Its work was characterized by activism and aggressive advocacy. Examples of the work include supporting organizing campaigns that included rent strikes, education boycotts against school segregation and demonstrations at construction sites demanding jobs for people of color. In 1968, MFY Legal Services challenged the governments arbitrary cutoff of welfare benefits, which resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court landmark decision Goldberg v. Kelly, affirming the right of public benefits recipients to a fair hearing before benefits are terminated. Writing in The New York Times, Linda Greenhouse noted that Goldberg v. Kelly . . . proved to be . . . a critical building block in what came to be known as the due process revolution. A series of decisions that followed erected a constitutional shield for the ordinary citizen against the arbitrary or standardless use of governmental power in many contexts. In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act imposed restrictions and reduced funding to the Legal Services Corporation that provided MFY Legal Services funding leading to the closing of several neighborhood offices. These federal restrictions such as preventing representation of undocumented New Yorkers or prohibition on class actions lawsuits led to MFY splitting from Legal Services NYC. In June 2017, MFY Legal Services changed its name to Mobilization for Justice.  Services  Mobilization for Justice provides free services on pressing civil legal needs including matters regarding housing and foreclosure; consumer, bankruptcy, tax and employment; a variety of legal issues faced by the aged and people with mental illness and physical disabilities; government benefits and immigration; and legal issues that kinship caregivers and parents of children with disabilities struggle with, such as special education needs. They provide access through legal hotlines and neighborhood clinics.  Policy advocacy  Mobilization for Justice has led numerous campaigns to change and improve public policies and the administration of justice in the court system. Recent campaigns include: Campaign to Fight Sewer Service: MFJ identified the problem that people were being sued for debts without ever getting notices from the debt collectors. MFJ worked with NYC Council Member Daniel Garodnick and the NYC Department Consumer Affairs to pass legislation and enact rules to more strictly regulate process servers. Campaign to Protect Homeowners in Foreclosure: In 2011, MFJ issued Justice Deceived: How Large Foreclosure Firms Subvert State Regulations Protecting Homeowners, followed in 2012 by Justice Unsettled: How the Foreclosure Shadow Docket  Discontinuances Prevent New Yorkers from Saving their Homes. These reports brought public attention to the shadow docket issue, where foreclosure firms failed to move cases to a judges docket, allowed them to remain in limbo, while the banks rejected mortgage payments and charged homeowners fees and interest. The campaign helped eliminate the shadow docket. Three-Quarter House Reform: In 2010, the organization launched a public campaign to expose abuses in the three-quarter house industry with a rally, a lawsuit, and, with Neighbors Together, a community-based organization, organized the Three-Quarter House Tenant Organizing Project, which produced Three Quarter House",

    "text": "Sampling risk is one of the many types of risks an auditor may face when performing the necessary procedure of audit sampling. Audit sampling exists because of the impractical and costly effects of examining all or 100 of a clients records or books. As a result, a sample of a clients accounts are examined. Due to the negative effects produced by sampling risk, an auditor may have to perform additional procedures which in turn can impact the overall efficiency of the audit. Sampling risk represents the possibility that an auditors conclusion based on a sample is different from that reached if the entire population were subject to audit procedure. The auditor may conclude that material misstatements exist, when in fact they do not; or material misstatements do not exist but in fact they do exist. Auditors can lower the sampling risk by increasing the sampling size. Although there are many types of risks associated with the audit process, each type primarily has an effect on the overall audit engagement. The effects produced by sampling risk generally can increase audit risk, the risk that an entitys financial statements will contain a material misstatement, though given an unqualified clean audit report. Sampling risk can also increase detection risk which suggests the possibility that an auditor will not find material misstatements relating to the financial statements through substantive tests and analysis.  Types of sampling risk   Typical scenarios  Auditors must often make professional judgments in assessing sampling risk. When testing samples the auditor is primarily concerned with two aspects of sampling risk: Risk of accepting incorrect data: the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded account balance is not materially misstated when it is materially misstated. Risk of incorrect rejection: the risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded amount balance is materially misstated when it is not materially misstated. In addition, the auditor is concerned with sampling risk and its relationship with controls. Two types of sample riskcontrol risks are: Assessing too low: the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is less than the true operating effectiveness of the control. Assessing too high: the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is greater than the true operating effectiveness of the control.  Sample selection  When selecting a sampling approach there are two approaches to audit sampling: non-statistical and statistical approach. Three ways that statistical sampling can assist the auditor are: to maximize the productivity with minimum wasted effort in designing the sample, to measure the sufficiency of the evidence taken during the audit, and to analyze the results. The statistical approach allows the auditor to measure the risk that is being sampled to help in reducing it to an acceptable level. With respect to performing samples, statistical sampling involves different kinds of costs such as training the auditors, designing individual samples to meet the requirements, and choosing the items to be examined. If there is insufficient audit evidence it is the responsibility of the auditor to choose between non statistical or the statistical sampling approaches considering their effectiveness and related costs. Although exercising careful judgment is crucial during every step of the sampling process, it is extremely necessary when choosing the non-statistical approach. This method does not include the use of tables or statistical percentages, but rather it relies upon professional judgment on the part of the auditor as well as the policy implemented by the firm. Under this approach, it is common practice for most accounting firms to create universal guidelines for auditors in order to determine a proper sample size. For example, if a given clients control risk is high, a firm would typically require a high sample size when selecting records. In order to successfully gather a sample, it is important to consider the collection as a whole and the relevance of the particular items. The most common successful method is to select an even number of items which accurately represents the list as a whole. Selecting only large or small numbers could distort the sample which creates risk.  See also  Sample statistics Audit  References",

Career  She covered the early stages of Yugoslav wars and frequently visited front lines, including the city of Sarajevo while it was under siege. In 1992 she announced that she would no longer report from battlefields because she could not bear writing about the destruction of cities and the killing of children. She returned to Belgrade and started reporting on politics. One of her most famous pieces is a piece about Arkan, in which she describes how a criminal came to be promoted as a national prophet. The piece was written with much sarcasm and irony.  Death and aftermath  She was found dead in her apartment on 8 April 1994. The police ruled it a suicide, but most evidence disputes this. She was active the day before and made many plans for the future. The diaries of Ratko Mladić mentioned that he knew who murdered Dada implying that it was Goran Vuković and Duško Malović. This may help reopen an investigation into her death. The Serbian government began a review in January 2013 of several suspicious cases involving murders of journalists in the 1990s, including Dada Vujasinović, Slavko Ćuruvija, and Milan Pantić. In 2014, Hleb Teater Archived 2019-01-02 at the Wayback Machine Belgrade created the performance Dada - an Essay in Motion, based on Vujasinovićs life, work and death.

    "text": "Mikhail Ivanovich Budenkov Russian: Михаил Иванович Буденков; 5 December 1919  2 August 1995 was a Soviet sniper in World War II. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 March 1945 for killing 413 Nazis. By the end of the war he had killed 437 Nazis, making him one of the best snipers of the war.  Early life  Budenkov was born on 5 December 1919 to a Russian peasant family in Slavtsevo. After completing seven grades, he worked on a collective farm, then studied to become a ship mechanic. He worked on a ship that sailed on the Moscow Canal. He returned to his home village in 1939 to work as a tractor driver, but later that year he was drafted into the Red Army and stationed in Brest.  World War II  As soon as the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, Budenkov fought on the frontlines as a sniper in the 84th Rifle Regiment. Initially, he was a part of the retreat towards Moscow, but in September 1942, he assumed command of a mortar crew and, in his spare time, began working as a sniper. In May 1942 he was wounded, but after he was released from the hospital in August 1942 he was assigned to the 59th Guards Rifle Regiment and was made commander of a mortar company. He hunted as a sniper in his free time, and killed 17 enemy soldiers this way before requesting a transfer to a rifle company in the same unit to fight as a sniper. He had killed over 200 enemy soldiers by mortar fire in the battles for Velikiye Luki. He specialized as a sniper, but utilized a machine gun during an offensive. He was wounded again in June 1943, but recovered and returned to combat. By September 1943 he had killed 107 Nazis by sniper fire, and the end of December brought his kill count to 158. During a battle that month he replaced his company commander, leading an advance on a strategic height and holding it, repelling counterattacks and not retreating despite getting wounded again. By the end of the battle, only eight soldiers were left, all wounded. He later became the party organizer of his battalion, having become a member of the Communist Party in 1943. His accurate sniper fire killed enemy machine gun crews in the battles for the city of Madona, allowing the advance of Soviet troops. His squad commander described him as a born sniper, and on 25 March 1945 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. He received his gold star on 19 May at a ceremony in the Kremlin, and on 24 June 1945 he marched in the famous Victory Day Parade on Red Square. Shortly before victory he was sent to a military-political school, but he did not graduate because he was demobilized in December 1945 with the rank of senior lieutenant.  Later life  He worked as deputy director of the Lyakhovskaya Machine-Tractor Station, and in 1947 he graduated from party school in Vladimir and then in Ivanovo in 1951. He then moved to Melenki, where he worked at a flax mill. He died on 2 August 1995.

    "text": "Angelus of Jerusalem, OCarm Italian: SantAngelo; 1185  5 May 1220 was a Catholic convert from Judaism and a religious priest of the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance. Angelus and his twin brother became converts to the faith following their mothers conversion. Both went on to become ordained priests and Carmelite friars. Unlike his brother, however, he retreated into the desert to a hermitage after his ordination, but he emerged once he was instructed to go to the Italian mainland to evangelize as well as to meet with Pope Honorius III to have him approve a new rule for the Carmelites. He was slain whilst preaching and was believed a saint after his death. The Carmelites venerated him as such until during his pontificate Pope Pius II beatified the slain priest circa 1459.  Life  He was born in Jerusalem in 1185 to Jewish parents. His mother later converted to Christianity, and both he and his twin brother John were baptised into the Catholic Church when she converted. His parents died while Angelus and his brother were still children, and the Patriarch Nicodemus oversaw their education until the twins turned eighteen. At that age, he and his brother John entered the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel at the Saint Anne convent near the Golden Gate to commence their novitiate. The two could speak Greek as well as both Latin and Hebrew. In 1210, Angelus was ordained to the priesthood in Jerusalem and he travelled in Palestine. Miraculous cures were attributed to him around this time and his acta stated that he sought to avoid fame and withdrew to a hermitage in the desert when he was becoming popular for his miracles. He became a hermit on Mount Carmel when he was instructed in 1218 to leave for the Italian peninsula in order to preach against the patarini as well as the Albigensians and the Bulgars. He had likewise been instructed to go to Rome to obtain from Pope Honorius III confirmation of the new and definitive rule for the order later granted in 1226. Angelus was one of the first friars to come to Sicily from Mount Carmel. He set off on a Genoese ship on 1 April 1219 and stopped first in Messina before heading off to Civitavecchia before he ended up in Rome to meet with the pope. The friar preached in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran while in Rome where he met both Francis of Assisi and Dominic of Osma. It is said that he foretold that Francis would receive the stigmata while Francis foretold his premature death. From there, he was a guest of the Basilians in Palermo where he was for over a month before preaching in Agrigento for over a month before settling in Licata. He had healed seven lepers and the ailing Archbishop of Palermo Bernardo de Castanea while in Palermo. He settled on the Sicilian island though his fame as a wonderworker caused crowds to flock to him. He also had success in converting some Jews though most Jews in Palermo came to despise him for this since he himself was once Jewish. He wanted to convert a Cathar knight named Berenger known also in sources as Berengarius. Tradition states that Berenger was living in incest and that the friar convinced the knights companion to leave Berenger. Berenger became enraged and had him attacked in front of the church of Santi Filippo e Giacomo in Licata on 1 May 1220. He died of his wounds within the week of 5 May and according to tradition asked for his assassin to be pardoned while urging the faithful not to avenge his death. He was buried at Santi Filippo e Giacomo.  Veneration  His sepulcher at Licata became a site of pilgrimage. The Carmelites venerated him as a saint since at least 1456 and the cult received papal approval from Pope Pius II at some stage during the latters pontificate. In 1486, his remains were moved from a wooden casket to a silver urn before being moved to a more precious urn on 5 May 1623. In 1632 his relics were translated to the Carmelite Church, and are now housed at the Santuario della Madonna del Carmine in Catania; the ending of a plague in the Kingdom of Naples in 1656, was attributed to his intercession. Since 4 May 1626, he has been known as the patron saint for Palermo. Daniel Papebroch sets no great value on any of the three different acts or relations of his martyrdom, but gives long accounts of miracles attributed to his intercession since his death, and of the great veneration which is paid to him in Sicily, especially at Licata and Palermo. As he and Albert of Trapani were the first two saints in the Order to have a cult, they are frequently found in medieval Carmelite iconography alongside the Virgin Mary. In the Carmelite church of Santa Maria del Carmelo in Traspontina in Rome, there is a chapel dedicated to St. Angelus with an altarpiece by Giovanni Battista Ricci.

Parallel slowdown is typically the result of a communications bottleneck. As more processor nodes are added, each processing node spends progressively more time doing communication than useful processing. At some point, the communications overhead created by adding another processing node surpasses the increased processing power that node provides, and parallel slowdown occurs. Parallel slowdown occurs when the algorithm requires significant communication, particularly of intermediate results. Some problems, known as embarrassingly parallel problems, do not require such communication, and thus are not affected by slowdown.

    "text": "The Kingdom of Prussia and the United States began diplomatic relations in 1785 following the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, but formal relations were not established until 1797. Relations would eventually end with World War I when the U.S. declared war on Germany.  History  After the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, The Kingdom of Prussia became therefore one of the first nations to officially recognize the young American Republic after the Revolution. The Treaty was signed to promote free trade and commerce and became a benchmark for subsequent free trade agreements and treaties. In addition, the treaty demanded the unconditionally humane custody for war prisoners, a novelty at the time. The treaty was renewed in 1799 after negotiations with then-United States Ambassador to Prussia John Quincy Adams. While the U.S. did not have a formal mission to Prussia, the construction of the current embassy to Germany began after the appointment of Adams as the ambassador in Berlin which was the capital of Prussia at the time. On May 1, 1828, both countries signed a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation which revived both the original Treaty of Amity and Commerce and its renewal in 1799. The treaty after German reunification remained intact as the treaty was regarded as binding and its provisions served for adjustments for commercial relations between Germany and the United States. It was until the outbreak of World War I that the treaty came under question and was no longer in continuance. By the late 1840s through the 1860s, trade between both countries grew rapidly. In 1846, the United States, Prussia, and Bremen, then the main German harbor for the American trade, founded the Ocean Steam Navigation Company OSNC, directed against British maritime supremacy in the North Atlantic. In part, the company was subsidized by Prussia. In 1855, Prussian Secretary of Trade August von der Heydt remarked about trade with the U.S. describing the importance of the United States for us as a market for our products has grown by leaps and bounds from one year to the next, and to such a degree, that the customs duty of that nation is, for our own industrial interests, of greater importance than that of most other states. During the American Civil War, the Kingdom of Prussia sent military officers to observe the conflict, the most notable being Justus Scheibert. The officers studied Union and Confederate tactics, the use of rail networks, rifled muskets, and logistics. When the Prussian officers returned, they delivered reports that assessed the capability of both American armies to be subpar in performance, citing overreliance on frontal assaults and inefficient supply lines. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Kingdom of Hanover and Duchy of Nassau, were subsequently merged directly into the Kingdom of Prussia. From this point, Hanover and Nassau had relations with the United States as a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. From February 22 and March 11, 1902, Prince Henry of Prussia visited the United States arriving at Shooters Island, New York City with President Theodore Roosevelt. On February 25, Kaiser Wilhelm IIs yacht Meteor III, was christened by Roosevelts daughter Alice Roosevelt Longworth. Henry then traveled to Washington, D.C. visiting the White House for a state dinner, United States Capitol, attending a memorial service to pay respects to William McKinley who was assassinated in 1901. Henry would then take an extended train trip on a special rail car to the Southern and Western United States with stops at Lookout Mountain, and the Lincoln Monument in Chicago. Henry returned to the East Coast where he visited the state capitol in Boston, reviewed cadets at West Point, New York at United States Military Academy, and was the guest of honor at a reception at the Union League in Philadelphia. Prince Henry left through New York on the S.S. Deutschland. The visit originally planned to have Henry land in New York, take a train to Washington, D.C., where the Prince would pay his respects to President Roosevelt, visit Cincinnati and Chicago, then return to New York via Niagara Falls. Relations ended on February 3, 1917, when U.S. President Woodrow Wilson instructed Secretary of State Robert Lansing to notify the German Ambassador to the United States that all diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the German Empire were severed. On April 6, 1917, Wilson declared war on Imperial Germany.

    "text": "Balyakalasakhi transl. Childhood Companion is a 2014 Malayalam language film adaptation of the famous novel of the same name by Vaikom Muhammad Basheer. The romantic musical drama film was written and directed by debutante Pramod Payyannur and stars Mammootty, Isha Talwar, Meena, Seema Biswas, KPAC Lalitha and Mamukkoya in lead roles. The story revolves around childhood sweethearts Majeed Mammootty and Suhra Isha Talwar. Born to rich parents, Majeed falls in love with his not-so-affluent neighbour Suhra. After her fathers death, when Suhra struggles to make both ends meet, Majeed pleads with his father to sponsor her education. Refused, he wanders off to distant lands. Some of the other characters created by Basheer such as Ettukali Mammoonju and Ottakannan Pokker also appear in the film. The film has lyrics and music created by several leading masters including P. Bhaskaran, K. Raghavan, K. T. Muhammed, O. N. V. Kurup, Kavalam Narayana Panicker, Sreekumaran Thampi, and Basheer himself. The launch of the film edition of the novel Balyakalasakhi was done by Leela Menon who handed over the book to Fabi Basheer, wife of Vaikom Muhammed Basheer.  Cast   Production  Pramod Payyannur, a familiar name in Malayalam theatre and television, made his debut on the big screen with the film. Mammootty was chosen to play the lead in film by Pramod Payyannur. He said in an interview with Malayala Manorama, Vaikom is the home of the writer Basheer, the character Majeed and also the actor Mammootty. Only a person who knew that place closely could imbibe that character in both looks and expressions. That search ended in Mammootty. On being quizzed about the inspiration to choose Kolkata as the location of the film, when Vaikom Muhammed Basheer has not referred to any specific city in the novel, Pramod says that Kolkata is perhaps the only Indian metro that still retains its old world charm and that it perfectly matched the setting of the films backdrop. Besides, Basheer is believed to have written Balyakalasakhi during his brief stay at a house in Lower Chitpur Road in Kolkata, he explains. Two seasons were shot in Kerala and Kolkata, West Bengal. The team began shooting in August, 2013 at Perumbalam near Vaikom. Mammootty began filming for Balyakalasakhi at Kolkata in October, 2013. The 18-day schedule included various places such as Victoria Memorial, Chhote Lal Ghat, in front of Town Hall.  Reception  Metromatinee.com said even if it has some limits, it is a timeless and exciting classic, Mammootty as lovelorn Majeed is impressive but a lack of good chemistry with Isha Talwar is a letdown. Deccan Chronicle said that Mammootty excelled in the double role as Majeed and as Majeeds father.  Soundtrack  The film has lyrics and music composed by several leading masters in the field while the background score was composed by Bijibal. The first line of the song Thaamara Poonkaavanathil Thaamasikkunnoley has been mentioned in the novel by Basheer himself. An oral traditional song of the Muslims in Kerala, the songs lines were supplemented with lyrics penned by K. T. Muhammed. It has been sung by legendary singer K. J. Yesudas. Kaalam Parakkanu, the second song composed by Raghavan Master, which has Pramods lyrics, has been sung by Raghavan Masters disciple V. T. Murali. P. Bhaskarans poem Ente Thoolika has been adapted for a song composed on the lines of Rabindra Sangeet. It is the title song and has a mix of Urdu lyrics and Baul music too. It has been sung by Shahabaz Aman. The entire song signifies a journey. The Urdu portion has been sung by Ustad Faiyaz Khan. Sreekumaran Thampis lyrics for the film has been sung by K. S. Chithra and Vijay Yesudas as a duet while O. N. V. Kurups poem Vaaghdatta Bhoomi has been translated into Bengali and sung by Bengali singer Raghav Chatterjee. Kavalam Narayana Panikkar has composed a song in the folk music tradition that makes use of Basheers idioms and words. It has been sung by Shahabaz. Mammootty officially launched the music on 6 January 2014 by handing over the CD to late music director Raghavan Masters family. The soundtrack consists of six songs and four karaoke versions.

Built in 1935 by a Works Progress Administration crew, this large gymnasium was the only surviving remnant of a major push in the 1920s and 1930s to improve the education of African Americans in Oak Grove. It was a single-story wood-frame structure with a gable roof, with a shed-roofed vestibule area on the main southern facade. At the time of its construction, it was the largest gymnasium in the state. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

    "text": "The Church of St James in Winscombe, Somerset, England, has 12th- or 13th-century origins but the present building dates from the 15th century. It is a Grade I listed building. There are no records remaining of the Norman church on the site, though the font and a single lancet window date from the period, and a Deed of Gift survives confirming that the church was consecrated by Bishop Jocelin on 26 August 1236. It was given by him to the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral three years later. The four-stage 100-foot 30.5 m tower one of the most elegant in Somerset was added around 1435, by Bishop John Harewell, and at the same time stained glass was added. The church was restored and a new chancel added in 1863. The rebuilding of the chancel was undertaken by William Burges. He was commissioned by the Reverend John Augustus Yatman, whose brother had been Burgess main client for painted furniture. Burges and his team, including Fred Weekes and Gualbert Saunders, also undertook the design of three stained-glass lancet windows in the chancel, in memory of Yatmans mother. Pevsner appreciated their quality, much better aesthetically is the glass in the chancel, but erroneously attributes them as one of the best examples of Morris glass in existence and quite unrecorded. The Carsleigh Window in the north wall of the chancel c. 1520 is decorated with silver stain, marking the close of the Middle Ages and the arrival of the Renaissance. There is medieval glass in the two windows in the north wall of the side chapel, and in the window next to the organ. The bells of St James have long called people to worship, the original bells being cast in 1773 by local founders the Bilbie family. Two newer bells were added in 1903 by Taylors Founders. The eight bells are in the key of E flat and the tenor weighs 1818 18 hundredweight, 1 quarter of a hundredweight and 8 lb, or 930 kg. St James holds regular services on Sundays, with bell ringing being provided for both the morning service and evensong.

    "text": "Wakatsuki 若月 was an Akizuki-class destroyer of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Her name means Young Moon. Wakatsuki played a minor role in the battle of the Empress Augusta Bay against a US cruiser-destroyer group, before surviving the bombing of Rabaul. After a series of escorting and transport missions, she escorted aircraft carriers at the disastrous battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, before being sunk by carrier aircraft at the battle of Ormoc Bay. Ironically, Wakatsuki is probably the most heavily photographed of any Akizuki class destroyer, despite there not being a single existing photo of the ship taken by her Japanese owners, simply due to the sheer amount of aerial photos taken of the ship by US warplanes during the bombing of Rabaul and battles of Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, and Ormoc Bay.  Design and description  The Akizuki-class ships were originally designed as anti-aircraft escorts for carrier battle groups, but were modified with torpedo tubes and depth charges to meet the need for more general-purpose destroyers. The ships measured 134.2 meters 440 ft 3 in overall, with beams of 11.6 meters 38 ft 1 in and drafts of 4.15 meters 13 ft 7 in. They displaced 2,701 long tons 2,744 t at standard load and 3,420 long tons 3,470 t at deep load. Their crews numbered 300 officers and enlisted men. Each ship had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of 52,000 shaft horsepower 38,776 kW for a designed speed of 33 knots 61 kmh; 38 mph. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them ranges of 8,300 nautical miles 15,400 km; 9,600 mi at speeds of 18 knots 33 kmh; 21 mph. The main armament of the Akizuki class consisted of eight 100-millimeter 3.9 in Type 98 dual-purpose guns in four twin-gun turrets, two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure. They each carried a dozen 25-millimeter 1 in Type 96 anti-aircraft AA guns in four triple-gun mounts. The ships were also each armed with four 610-millimeter 24 in torpedo tubes in a single quadruple rotating mount amidships; one reload was carried for each tube. The first batch of ships were each equipped with two depth charge throwers for which 54 depth charges were carried. Wakatsuki was equipped with a Type 21 early-warning radar on her foremast.  Construction and career  Wakatsuki was commissioned on 31 May 1943 into the 11th Destroyer Squadron for training. During these initial months, Wakatsuki operating alongside the destroyer Tamanami during their training duty of Hashirajima, including managing to tow the 40,000 ton battleship Nagato at a speed of 12 knots, and it was during this time period on the 8th of June that the battleship Mutsu suddenly and violently sank in harbor to a magazine detonation, prompting Wakatsuki and Tamanami to assist in rescuing 353 survivors. On 22 June, Wakatsuki departed Japan for the first time to escort the battleship Musashi which was carrying the remains of Admiral Yamamoto. She then escorted the troop transport Sagara Maru when she was crippled by a torpedo from the submarine USS Harder, requiring her to be towed to Japan. Underway, she was hit by another two torpedoes from the submarine USS Pompano, which finished her off as Wakatsuki abandoned her to sink. Shortly afterwards, Wakatsuki was reassigned to the 7th destroyer division with her sisterships Suzutsuki and Hatsuzuki, From 18-25 September, Wakatsuki escorted the combined fleet on a mission to counter US carrier raids, but no action occurred. A similar mission occurred from 17-26 October, and again they encountered no enemy forces, and from 30 October to 1 November she took part in a troop transport mission from Truk to Rabaul. Upon arriving, she was appointed as part of a task force with the goal of hunting attacking an allied cruiser force to replicate a battle of Savo Island style naval victory. This action occurred became the battle of the Empress Augusta Bay on 1-2 November. However, Wakatsuki contributed very little to the battle, unleashing several salvos of 3.9-inch 10 cm gunfire, but missing her shots, before avoiding a collision with the heavy cruiser Haguro. In turn, the light cruiser Sendai and the destroyer Hatsukaze were sunk, and several other ships were damaged, sending off the Japanese task force and ending the battle in a US victory. Later over the course of several days, Rabaul was attacked by hundreds of land based and carrier aircraft, during which Wakatsuki was attacked by several aircraft, and damaged by bomb near misses but not directly hit. She was however caught on video by US dive bombers, and was shown in a news reel of the bombing of Rabaul. The US mistook Wakatsuki for a cruiser and claimed to sink her. In actuality, the destroyer only suffered minor damage, and took part in several troop transport and escort missions, being present during the sinking",

The Scottish Championship was established in July 2013, after the Scottish Professional Football League was formed by a merger of the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League.  Format  Teams play each opponent four times in the season, twice at home and twice away from home. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned league champion. If points are equal, the goal difference determines the winner. If this still does not result in a winner, the tied teams must take part in a playoff game at a neutral venue to determine the final placings.  Promotion and relegation  The champions are directly promoted to the Scottish Premiership, swapping places with the bottom club of the Premiership. The clubs finishing 2nd, 3rd and 4th then enter the two-legged Premiership play-off. The 3rd-placed club plays the 4th-placed club, with the winner then playing the 2nd-placed club. The winner of that game then plays against the 11th-placed Premiership club. If the Championship play-off winner prevails, the club is promoted and the Premiership club is relegated; otherwise, the Premiership club remains in its league while the Championship club is not promoted. For promotion and relegation, the Championship play-off system closely mirrors its Premiership counterpartthe bottom-ranked club in the Championship is automatically relegated while the 9th-placed club undergoes a play-off with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed clubs from League One.

Originally named and described as the agamid Amphibolurus mckenziei, the lizard had been identified within the regions of Western Australia and South Australia in which it occupied the shrubbery and woodland areas as its habitat. It was subsequently transferred to the genus Ctenophorus along with other agamid species with which it shared similar morphology and characteristics. The name mckenziei is in reference to Norman Leslie McKenzie, who was a zoologist and discovered the existence of the lizard. Listed on the IUCN red list page, threats to its population numbers are evaluated as least concern; however, its numbers are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and feral predators.  Etymology  Ctenophorus mckenziei was discovered first by Norman Leslie McKenzie. McKenzie worked for the Department of Conservation and Land Management, Western Australia, and was a zoologist for the Western Australian government as a Research Scientist 1970. The lizard was named after McKenzie who contributed to the research of Ctenophorus mckenziei, as he was a co-collector of the specimens and donor of much other material in the Western Australian Museum.  Description  The average total length of the dwarf-bicycle dragon is 6.5 cm 2.6 in, with a snout-to-vent length SVL of 31.576.5 mm 1.243.01 in, and a tail length approximately 230 of this length. It is perceived as having an alternating colour of black and brown on the top of its body, whilst progressively turning paler on the head and accompanied with a series of greyish-white spots, dashes and lines. These lines that appear, form narrow, paravertebral and dorso-lateral stripes from its head to the base of the tail, connected by a series of pale transverse bars. There are some pale upper lateral spots and a pale mid-lateral stripe that extends from the groin to the axilla and partially along the tail. Its underside characteristics include a white colouration, with a singular dark grey patch which is apparent on both the throat and the chest in males. This varies with the females which are densely stippled with a dark grey patch. Around its gular fold on the underside of its neck both males and females have dark ventral markings consisting of broad median stripes extending from its chin to gular fold. Adjacent to this, it has a rhomboidal shaped breast patch that can extend as far as to its groin on the underside of its belly. In similar nature to other species of Ctenophorus, its tympanum is visible, indicating it is able to hear. The canthus, or inner corner of its eye, is presented as angular. Its nostril is oval-shaped and faces outwards in a nasal scale that lies just below its canthal ridge. The lizards bodily stance has an adpressed hindlimb, that is adjacent to the ground. This limb when stretched reaches to around the eye or just beyond. The measurements of this hindlimb indicate it is about 85 of the snout-vent length.  Scalation  The lizard has dorsal body scalation, with the dorsal scales appearing small and sharply keeled. Similarly, accompanied with this, the scales that appear on the tail and legs are noticeably bigger and more sturdily keeled compared with its dorsal scales. It has a sequence of scales that are enlarged compared to dorsal scalation located on its neck, which are continuous with the vertebral series of enlarged scales that is present. On a skin-fold located on its neck, it has a cluster of smaller spinose scales. The scales that appear on the gular and ventral areas of the lizard are smooth.  Distribution  Ctenophorus mckenziei has been identified and collected from a limited number of locations that are distinguished within two minor regions in Western Australia and South Australia. Originally, during the 1984 Nullarbor survey in South Australia, it was first recorded at two separate sites that were 34 km 1.92.5 mi away from each other within the Yalata Indigenous Protected Area IPA. It was further recorded during the 1987 DEH Biological Survey in the Yellabinna Region at an equally small number of sites just a few kilometres to the east of the IPA. This total of six sites in which the lizard has been found within the IPA, attributed to two in 1984 and another for in 20072008, are all within 1012 kilometres 6.27.5 mi of each other, which justifies the rare status of the lizard. C. mckenziei has also been identified as living within a small area inland from Israelite Bay, Western Australia. Due to inaccessibility to the habitat of the lizard as a result of isolation from major population centres, it restricts visitation and research projects which limits the ability for study and knowledge of this species to expand, thus hypothesising a larger range of habitat within the SAWA region.  Habitat  Similar to other endemic",

    "text": "Przewalskis horse Equus ferus przewalskii or Equus przewalskii, also called the takhi, Mongolian wild horse or Dzungarian horse, is a rare and endangered wild horse originally native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky. Once extinct in the wild, since the 1990s it has been reintroduced to its native habitat in Mongolia in the Hustai National Park, Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, Khomiin Tal, and several other locales in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Several genetic characteristics of Przewalskis horse differ from those seen in modern domestic horses, indicating neither is an ancestor of the other. For example Przewalskis horse has 33 chromosome pairs compared with 32 for the domestic horse. Their ancestral lineages split from a common ancestor between 160,000 and 38,000 years ago, long before the domestication of the horse. Przewalskis horse was long considered the only remaining truly wild horse, in contrast with the American mustang and the Australian brumby, which are feral horses descended from domesticated animals. That status was called into question when domestic horses of the 5,000-year-old Botai culture of Central Asia were found to be more closely related to Przewalskis horses than to E. f. caballus. The study raised the possibility that modern Przewalskis horses could be the feral descendants of the domestic Botai horses. However, it remains possible that both the Botai horses and the modern Przewalskis horses descend separately from the same ancient wild Przewalskis horse population. Its taxonomic position is still debated, with some taxonomists treating Przewalskis horse as a species, E. przewalskii, others as a subspecies of wild horse E. ferus przewalskii or a variety of the domesticated horse E. ferus caballus. Przewalskis horse is stockily built, smaller, and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Typical height is about 1214 hands 4856 inches, 122142 cm, and the average weight is around 300 kg 660 lb. They have a dun coat with pangaré features and often have dark primitive markings.  Taxonomy  Przewalskis horse was formally described as a novel species in 1881 by Ivan Semyonovich Polyakov. The taxonomic position of Przewalskis horse remains controversial, and no consensus exists about whether it is a full species as Equus przewalskii; a subspecies of Equus ferus, the wild horse, as Equus ferus przewalskii in trinomial nomenclature, along with two other subspecies, the domestic horse E. f. caballus, and the extinct tarpan E. f. ferus; or even a subpopulation of the domesticated horse. The American Society of Mammalogists considers both Przewalskis horse and the tarpan to be subspecies of Equus ferus and classifies the domesticated horse as a separate species, Equus caballus.  Lineage  Genetic analysis shows that the takhi and the domesticated horse differ significantly, with neither ancestral to the other. The evolutionary divergence of the two populations was estimated to have occurred about 72,00038,000 years ago, well before domestication, most likely due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. According to a 2009 study, the earliest known domesticated horses were found at settlements of the Botai culture, from about 5500 years ago. These horses were raised for meat and milk. In 2018 a new study indicated ancient horses of the Botai culture are related to takhis, not to domesticated horses as was previously thought. Specifically, the Botai horses appeared to be ancestral to the modern takhi, because all seven takhis nested within the phylogenetic tree of the 20 Botai horses. No comparison was made to definitively wild early takhis. The authors posit that modern Przewalskis horses are feral descendants of the ancient Botai domesticated animals rather than representing a surviving population of never-domesticated horses. Another geneticist pointed out that Przewalskis horses may have simply descended from the same wild population that the Botai horses came from, which would still be compatible with the findings of the study. In 2021, William Taylor and Christina Barron-Ortiz disputed the evidence for domestication of Przewalskis horse. Their case was rejected by Alan Outram and colleagues in a paper which was not dated or peer-reviewed. Taylor reiterated his arguments that Przewalskis horse had never been domesticated in an article in Scientific American in 2024. In any case, the Botai horses were found to have negligible genetic contribution to any of the ancient or modern domestic horses studied, indicating that the domestication of the latter was independent, involving a different wild population, from any possible domestication of Przewalskis horse by the Botai culture.  Characteristics  Przewalskis horse is stockily built in comparison to domesticated horses, with shorter legs, and is much smaller and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Ty",

Biography  Moore was born in Rule, Texas and was raised in Haskell, Texas. Moore went to Haskell High School. Moores early flight instruction included learning to trust the airplane itself. She recalled that her flight instructor told her to take her hands and feet off the controls so that she could see that the plane would stay in the air on its own. One of her first flight passengers was her mother. Moore graduated from Southern Methodist University and attended Texas State College for Women. She began training in the Women Airforce Service Pilots WASP on November 1, 1943, at Avenger Field. Her parents, who supported her desire to serve, drove her to training. She graduated from her WASP training on May 23, 1944. Moore was stationed at Perrin Field. As a WASP, she ferried planes, some of which no longer had functioning instruments, forcing her to use dead reckoning. Many of the planes she flew were from Kelly Field, which was closing and she most often ferried BT-13s and AT-6s. She also tested planes after they were repaired. Moore married Captain Stanley L. Moore in 1945 and the couple settled in Sherman, Texas where Stanley was stationed. She went on to live as a homemaker and stay at home mother.

The album was released on October 21, 2011, in Ireland, on October 24, 2011, in the United Kingdom, and on October 25, 2011, in the United States. Receiving generally positive reviews from critics, Christmas is Bublés most successful album with more than 16 million copies worldwide as of January 2022, making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and one of the best-selling Christmas albums worldwide. On the week ending December 10, 2011, Christmas rose to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart, becoming Bublés third chart-topper following 2007s Call Me Irresponsible and 2009s Crazy Love, and spent five weeks at No. 1. Over the years, the album has reached number one in twenty international charts, including Australia, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom. The album also won a Juno Award for Album of the Year, making it the first holiday album to win the award. The album was re-released on November 26, 2012, containing four additional tracks, including a new recording of The Christmas Song. Bublé also released a reworked version of White Christmas, this time featuring Shania Twain, as a single. This version premiered on Bublés NBC television special, Home for the Holidays, on December 10, 2012.  Background  The album is Bublés second Christmas-themed release after he released a five-track extended play, titled Let It Snow in 2003. Some of the songs from Let It Snow have been re-recorded for inclusion on Christmas, making Christmas his first full-length holiday release. For the album, Bublé teamed up with several well-known artists to record duets. His duet version of White Christmas with country music singer Shania Twain was based on an early arrangement by The Drifters, while his recording of Jingle Bells with the Puppini Sisters was based on the 1943 recording of Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters. He also teamed up with Latin star Thalía for a recording of Feliz Navidad. Bublé also recorded covers of Mariah Careys All I Want for Christmas Is You, and Blue Christmas, and a brand new track, Cold December Night, written with his longtime co-writer Alan Chang and producer Bob Rock.  Promotion  The albums track listing was unveiled by Bublé on September 27, 2011. Bublé filmed several music videos in order to promote the album, including videos for the tracks Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, the lead single All I Want for Christmas Is You, Holly Jolly Christmas, Christmas Baby Please Come Home, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, and Jingle Bells. Bublé also appeared to perform during the final of the eighth series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom on December 11, 2011. Bublés recording of All I Want for Christmas Is You was also featured in a montage on ABC-TVs General Hospital that aired on December 23, 2011.  Specials  On December 6, 2011, Bublé promoted the album in the United States with the broadcast of an NBC television special, A Michael Bublé Christmas, a show produced by Ben Silverman. The special was viewed by more than 7.07 million viewers, receiving a 1.5 rating and 4 share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. In Canada, the special was viewed by 1.533 million viewers, ranking the seventeenth most watched programme overall for the week. Zap2it reviewed the special, and claimed it to be one of the years television guilty pleasures. On December 18, 2011, Bublé promoted the album in the United Kingdom with the broadcast of an ITV1 television special, Michael Bublé: Home for Christmas. The special featured guest appearances from comedian Dawn French, duet performances with both Kelly Rowland and Gary Barlow, and a cooking tutorial with Gino DAcampo. The special pulled in 5.7 million viewers, and was the third most-watched ITV Christmas special of the season. Bublé later announced that he was to film another NBC special, titled Michael Bublé: Home for the Holidays, featuring guest appearances from Rod Stewart, Blake Shelton, and Carly Rae Jepsen. The special aired on December 10, 2012; and was watched by 5.66 million American viewers, receiving a 1.44 18-49 ratingshare. On October 18, 2013, it was announced that Bublé would feature in a third Christmas special on December 18, 2013, via NBC. Guest stars featuring in the special included Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and Cookie Monster.  Reception  Christmas received generally positive reviews from critics. Mike Diver of BBC News, although he found the album a predictable programme, prised that Bublé does the classics to an accomplished standard and everything is professionally packaged and described the vocals smooth and steady, his lines wrap around these familiar pieces like fine ribbon around a promisingly shaped gift.

History  Initially launched on October 23, 1990, under Unilevers Ragú brand in the United States and Canada, it was launched in the United Kingdom under the Knorr brand in 1993, while the same year, Chicken Tonight made its way to Oceania under the Raguletto brand. As of 2025, Chicken Tonight is a standalone brand. The associated advertising slogan is I feel like Chicken Tonight. In one series of television ads, these words were sung by actors as they flapped their arms in a movement similar to the dance The Chicken. An advertisement for Chicken Tonight was the first in the United Kingdom to use a red button interactive service to promote the product. The American version of the product was met with limited success; however, as of 2025, it is still sold in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Association football player Ian Wright appeared in advertisements for the product. In 2011, Unilever sold the Ragu business and the Chicken Tonight brand in a deal worth 30m in the United Kingdom to Symingtons, a food manufacturer in Leeds, who would drop the Knorr branding. Symingtons later acquired the Oceania rights to Raguletto and Chicken Tonight; they have since been acquired by Simplot. In 2019, Unilever also sold Chicken Tonight brand in the Netherlands to Zwanenberg Food Group.  In popular culture  The slogan was parodied in a skit on the Australian television series The Late Show in 1993 with Dickhead Tonight, where people danced while singing I Feel Like a Dickhead Tonight. The dance and song of the advertisement were parodied by The Simpsons family in the episode Lady Bouviers Lover. A segment on an Americas Funniest Home Videos episode parodied the brand as Iguana Tonight.  References   External links  Official website",

    "text": "Ford Model AA is a truck from Ford. As the Model T and TT became obsolete and needed to be replaced, Henry Ford began initial designs on the Model A and Model AA in 1926. Basic chassis layout was done rapidly and mechanical development was moved forward quickly. Body design and style was developed and then outsourced to various body manufacturers, including Briggs and Murray. The designs of the Model A shared parts and materials with the Model AA Ford, notably the body, engine and interior. The AA usually received plainer interiors than their car counterparts. The Model AA followed similar design changes to the Model A during the AAs four years in production, often delayed anywhere from three to nine months. The mechanical changes and upgrades were done during production of the vehicles. Body changes that occurred between 1929 and 1930 were also integrated into AA production, but leftover parts were used longer in the heavy commercial trucks.  Mechanical details  The Model AA Ford is powered by the same 201-cubic-inch 3.3 L I4 engine that the Model A Ford used. The engine produced a maximum of 40 horsepower at 2,200 rpm. The engine featured an up-draft carburetor, six-volt generator, 2 and 4-blade fan, mechanical water pump, mechanical oil pump, electric starter and four-row radiator. All of these features were identical to the Model A Ford except the radiator. The engine could also be crank started if necessary by a hand crank that is inserted through a hole in the radiator shell. The Model AA was based on a chassis that was similar in design to the Model A Ford, except it was substantially larger and heavier to accommodate the work this truck was designed for. The Model AA Ford has a four-speed manual gearbox. The additional gear in the transmission is a granny or creeper first gear with a higher reduction ratio than the first gear on a Model A Ford to provide more torque to move a loaded truck. The second through fourth gears on the Model AA transmission were similar ratios to the first through third gears on the Model A transmission. The Model AA transmission also featured a lock-out on the shift knob for reverse that required a lever to be activated with the thumb so reverse could be engaged. This was done to prevent accidental engagement of reverse while the truck was in motion. Early trucks had a worm gear rear-end that limited the top speed of the truck. That rear-end was replaced by a ring and pinion differential to improve the speed of the truck. The later differential came with high speed and low speed options. Later models were fitted with braces on the outer casing of the rear-end to provide additional support to the rear-end housing. The suspension of the AA Truck was similar to the Model A Ford in the front end. A leaf spring is centered in the front A frame over the front axle. Shock absorbers were available for the front end. The rear suspension differed from the Model A Ford. The AA had leaf springs mounted to the chassis and shackled to the rear axle. The rear suspension did not have shocks. The controls in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except the windshield wipers in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a pull lever system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the brake rods that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever on the floor with a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted in the middle of the steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the steering assembly. The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance and retard of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the idling speed of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine. The gauge cluster includes three basic gauges. The cluster is in a diamond formation, with the start key and pop-out locking switch is on the left point. The top of the cluste",

    "text": "The Scanlan Building is a building in Downtown Houston.  History  The building was first envisioned by Thomas Howe Scanlan, two-time mayor of Houston, to be built on the property he owned at Main and Preston streets. After his death in 1906, his seven daughters built the building as a memorial to him. Approximately 85 feet by 101 feet, the building was among the first in Houston to use a fireproof steel skeleton. The Scanlan Building, located at 405 Main Street in Houston, Texas, is an eleven-story, 76,403sq.ft building completed in 1909. Built on the site of the first official home of the president of the Republic of Texas, it was the first building of its size and type to be designed by a major national architect to be built in Houston, and set the style for future construction in the area. It is the only known office building in Houston which was designed by D.H. Burnham  Company of Chicago. The building was the first to be built higher than ten stories, breaking the limit preferred by Houston developer Jesse H. Jones. D. H. Burham  Company started work on the Scanlan Building just after the Columbian Exhibition of 1893. The steel-frame building was built in the Chicago style, with an L-shaped inner structure, permitting ventilation to the interior of the building. Facial details were restricted to the street sides of the building. Above the ground floor, all floors had an identical plan, with halls with offices on both sides, and one outer executive suite, including an interior office separated from the corridor by a receptionist office. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 23, 1980.  Current use  Workspace provider Novel Coworking purchased the Scanlan Building in June 2014 and renovated the buildings interior to provide private offices and co-working space for entrepreneurs and small businesses that need flexible, short-term workspace. As of February 2024, the owners, Level One, a subsidiary of Expansive a renaming of Novel, defaulted on its loan due in November 2023. The Scanlan Building was scheduled for foreclosure auction in March 2024.

    "text": "ReDOMption is the sixth episode of the fifth season of the American comedy-drama television series Entourage. It is the 60th overall episode of the series and was written by series creator Doug Ellin, and directed by Seith Mann. It originally aired on HBO on October 12, 2008. The series chronicles the acting career of Vincent Chase, a young A-list movie star, and his childhood friends from Queens, New York City, as they attempt to further their nascent careers in Los Angeles. In the episode, Dom returns and asks for Vinces help, but Eric distrusts him. Meanwhile, Turtle starts working as Dramas personal assistant, while Ari plays golf with Alan Gray to get a big role for Vince. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 1.61 million household viewers and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 1849. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the disjointed the storylines, particularly Doms subplot.  Plot  Hoping to get Vince Adrian Grenier in Smoke Jumpers, Ari Jeremy Piven decides to visit Alan Gray Paul Ben-Victor at a golf course to bet on the role. Ari is confident that Alans poor skills will be enough to win the bet, until he finds that Alans coach is Phil Mickelson, and that Alan invited Bob Ryan Martin Landau to insult Aris performance during the game. Vince is called by Dom Domenick Lombardozzi, who is on a car chase with LAPD officers on live TV. Dom is arrested and placed on jail, and he asks Vince to bail him out. Vince makes Eric Kevin Connolly pay the 100,000 bail, frustrating him. Believing that Dom is lying over his family and attempts at becoming a better person, Eric decides to watch over him through the day. He gets him to accompany them to a meeting where his client Charlie Bow Wow manages to land a pilot. Meanwhile, Turtle Jerry Ferrara desperately needs money, so he agrees to work as a personal assistant to Drama Kevin Dillon. However, Dramas complicated demands prove to be difficult for Turtle, who decides to get him an extra willing to have sex with him to make up for it, but Drama refuses. Eventually, Turtle decides to just quit. Ari loses the game, even when Alan gives him an easy final chance to score. Alan then begins insulting Ari for ruining his day by mentioning Vince, until he suddenly collapses from a heart attack. Vince and Eric visit Doms house, meeting his wife and child, both unaware of his arrest. They tell Dom to be honest with them, believing his wife will forgive him. Instead, his wife abandons him and Dom asks to go back to prison, feeling he has nothing left. At the apartment, the boys are called by Ari, who informs them that Alan died from the heart attack.  Production   Development  The episode was written by series creator Doug Ellin, and directed by Seith Mann. This was Ellins 38th writing credit, and Manns third directing credit.  Reception   Viewers  In its original American broadcast, ReDOMption was seen by an estimated 1.61 million household viewers with a 1.0 in the 1849 demographics. This means that 1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a slight increase in viewership with the previous episode, which was watched by an estimated 1.53 million household viewers with a 0.9 in the 1849 demographics.  Critical reviews  ReDOMption received mixed reviews from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode a good 7.5 out of 10 and wrote, Overall, this was a very decent episode, and it served the purpose of slightly advancing the overall storyline, but on its own, it doesnt stand up so well. It felt like a series of separate stories randomly put together, all of which were neither overly funny, nor were they memorably dramatic. One of the main problems was Dom, who despite all of his sorrows and bad luck, is a character thats too hard to like. Even with his losses at the end of the episode, its hard to feel any sympathy for him. The twist with Alan Gray was well played however, but it happened at the very end of the episode, so by the time the implications of his death started to settle in, the show was over. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B grade and wrote, While a lot of the shows comedic premise has gotten pretty tiredAri is angry, Drama is dumb, Turtle is highplot-wise, I think the show is more interesting than its been since the days of Aquaman. Alan Sepinwall wrote, I actually have very little to say about tonights Entourage, save that the ending of Aris story feels like its going to be a particularly skeevy way for the show to travel its usual everything works out just fine for Vince route. Kristal Hawkins of Vulture wrote, A sobered Ari calls the boys to let them know what happened and announces hes going home to his family because life is short. Next week, we assume  and will only assume, not actually try to find out  everything will return",

    "text": "Gladys Penny Thompson October 17, 1917  September 22, 1975 was an American aviator and womens intercontinental air race-air show promoter and aviation publisher-editor during the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1953, she married Miami Herald humor columnist Larry Thompson, and for 20 years until his death, she was featured often in his daily column, Life With Larry Thompson and in three books he authored. She founded the Miami-Dade Mothers of Twins Club and the Twins Easter Parade.  Early years  Born Gladys Rhodes, Penny Thompson watched planes fly over her familys farm in Sylvania, Georgia, as a young girl. This, along with her admiration for famed aviator Amelia Earhart, inspired her to fly. After getting her private pilots license in 1936, she moved to Miami, Florida, where the aviation industry was burgeoning. She published and edited an aviation newspaper, Southeastern Aviation News from 1945-1950.  Civil Air Patrol  During World War II, she joined the Civil Air Patrol as a volunteer and flew over the Gulf of Mexico searching for German submarines that were attacking Allied merchant ships. Her plane was destroyed in a fire on September 15, 1945, along with several hundred U.S. Navy aircraft and civilian planes battened down in giant wooden hangars at the Naval Air Station Richmond south of Miami in preparation for a major hurricane. Today, the Larry and Penny Thompson Memorial Park is located on the same property that originally encompassed the Naval Air Station.  Ninety-Nines  In 1946 she won the Bertram Trophy Race sponsored by the Ninety-Nines, the womens pilot organization started by Earhart, at the Florida Air Pilots Association Meet in Orlando, Florida. That same year Penny was elected vice chairman of the Florida chapter of the Ninety-Nines and chairman in 1947. Later in 1947, she led the drive to name the Miami Municipal Airport the Amelia Earhart Field, to honor the aviator who began her around-the-world flight from that field in 1937, disappearing over the Pacific Ocean.  Worlds First All-Woman Air Show  Following World War II, the annual All-American Air Maneuvers aviation event resumed in 1946 at Coast Guard Air Station Miami. The next year, women fliers were told they couldnt participate; so the women of the Florida Ninety-Nines organized their own air show at Tampa, Floridas Peter O. Knight Airport. Penny was selected as the general chairman of the worlds first All-Woman Air Show, held March 1516, 1947. It included a transcontinental air race from Palm Springs, California to Tampa. Proceeds were used to help young women obtain advanced aviation training through the Amelia Earhart Scholarship Fund. The event raised awareness of women in aviation and prompted air derbies and air marking parties throughout the U.S. The tradition of annual womens air races was begun. Penny played a role during this period in helping to elevate women in the male-dominated world of aviation and getting women fliers back into the mens All-American Air Maneuvers the next year, in large part due to the success of the 1947 All-Woman Air Show. In 1948, Penny also helped organize and promote the 2nd Annual All-Woman Air Show held June 46 at the Amelia Earhart Field in Miami, along with another transcontinental air race for female pilots, again raising money for the womens scholarship fund. The festivities culminated with the women fliers taking off from Key West, Florida for Havana, Cuba, 90 miles away, to continue their public relations efforts of promoting women in aviation.  Flying car  In 1949 Penny and Ellen Gilmore flew an experimental flying car called the Roadable Ercoupe, as part of the Montreal-Miami All-Womans Air Race, which culminated with the 3rd Annual All-Woman Air Show of the World in West Palm Beach, Florida. Landing in Jacksonville, Florida, they folded up the wings at sunset and drove on A1A the rest of the way to Daytona Beach, Florida, at night, then flew the rest of the way to Miami after daybreak. While they didnt win any prizes because the rules stated flying had to be during the day, their goal of obtaining national publicity for women pilots in general and the womens air show in particular, was successful., Their trip was featured in the nationally syndicated Smilin Jack aviation comic strip by Zack Mosley with Miss Penny-Ellen drawn on the comic stripss flying car. As a sign of the times, the character Smilin Jack said, This generation of girls has migrated from the kitchen to the cockpit! as he watched Penny and Ellen take off in their flying car.  Life with Larry Thompson  Several years later, Penny was interviewed by humorist Larry Thompson and reporter for the Miami Herald, who was doing a story on women in aviation. On February 13, 1953 they married. About that time, he was promoted to writing a daily humor column for the Herald and for the next 20 years until his death in 1973, Penny was thrust into the public spotl",

    "text": "Christophe Thivrier 16 May 1841  8 August 1895 was a French politician of working class origins who was the first Socialist mayor in France, and deputy of Allier from 1889 to 1895. At this time the industrialists of France were using dismissals and other forms of repression in an attempt to stamp out socialism, and workers were responding with strikes. Thivrier was uncompromising in his socialist principles, and was known as the deputé en blouse for wearing his blue workers smock in the Assembly to the outrage of the bourgeois members.  Early years 184174  Christophe Thivrier or Tivrier, known as Christou was born on 16 May 1841 in Durdat-Larequille, Allier, the youngest of four children. His parents were Jean Gilbert Thivrier 18091904 and Marie Anne Mansier 17991852. His father was from Néris-les-Bains, and worked as a farm laborer, in construction and in the mines. Christophe had to leave school and start work at an early age. He became a miner. When he was 28 he became a small building contractor, and later became a wine merchant. He was one of the founders of the labour movement in Allier. The Marianne, a secret society created to fight the reactionary actions of conservatives, often met in his home. On 15 November 1868 he married in Durdat-Larequille to Marie Martin 18421932. Their children were Gilbert Alphonse 1869-1936, Léon Martial 1871-1920, Joseph Isidore 1874-1944 and Louise Angéline 1879-1973.  Local politics 187489  In 1874 Thivrier was elected municipal councilor for Commentry on the Republican list. He was reelected in 1878. In 1879 he became a supporter of collectivism, and on 21 January 1881 he was elected to the council with the entire list of workers and socialists. It was the first town hall in France to be captured by the workers party and the socialists. Thivrier defeated Stéphane Mony, the director of the Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville, which owned the local mines, and a former mayor and deputy. A list was prepared of everyone who had spread socialist propaganda during the elections, including 135 miners. On 4 June 1881 they were all dismissed, and the workers went on strike. Another 300 were added to the list of agitators during the strike, and had to pass interviews to get their jobs back after the strike. 60 failed these interviews, and 67 were told they needed certificates of good conduct from their new employers before they could work again at the mines. Miners who had been elected to the local council could not find work and had to leave the district. Despite this repression, Thivrier was Mayor of Commentry from 4 June 1882, then district councilor, and gained huge support from the working class. Harassment by the prefectural administration against the workers administration and government persecution prevented the Socialist Party from presenting a list in the elections on 1884, but on 6 May 1888 Thivrier was reelected in triumph and again appointed Mayor of Commentry. He was removed from office on 14 December 1888 for having sent an address of sympathy to the trade union congress in Bordeaux that he signed with his title of mayor. Thivriers popularity grew, and in 1889 he was elected to the General Council of Allier.  Deputy 188995  Thivrier was elected deputy of Allier on 6 October 1889. In his election manifesto he denounced the oppression and misery of the workers, and proposed social measures such as social support for the old and disabled, responsibility of company owners for workplace accidents, and a direct tax on wealth and income. At the request of the Commentry Socialists he continued to wear his blue workers blouse smock in the Chamber as a symbol of the protest of the proletariat against the privileges of the capitalists, and a symbol of their hope of emancipation. He had campaigned as a Boulangist, but joined the Workers Party POF after being elected. Friedrich Engels saw the elections as a success, counting Eugène Baudin, Thivrier and Félix Lachizefr as Marxists, and considering that Gustave Paul Cluseret and Ernest Ferroul were bound to cast in their lot with the first three. However, Baudin, Lachize and Cluseret were never active in the POF, and Thivrier and Ferroul joined the POF after the election. In 1890 a strike broke out in Commentry due to the dismissal of 300 miners chosen from the most active socialists. Thivrier spoke out against the interventions and provocations of the army and gendarmerie in support of the mining company. Thivrier was a delegate of the French Workers Party at the Congress of Lille and Calais 1890 and at the International Congress of Brussels. He was soon criticized by his party for his sympathy with the Blanquist Central Revolutionary Committee CRC. His relationship with Jean Dormoyfr and the Montluçon socialists became strained. At the 1892 National Guesdist Congress in Marseille Thivrier raised violent controversy by defending the general",

Furthermore, not all bloggers within the Mormon blogosphere are Latter-day Saints themselves.  History  On November 23, 2002, the Mormon blogging community became a distinct entity with the founding of the blog Metaphysical Elders. Some component blogs from the Mormon blogospheres first two years were short lived, however one of its first bloggers, Dave Banack, began his longstanding Mormon Inquiry blog on August 19, 2003. On January 1, 2003, a multi-author blog Mormon Momma launched  a spin-off from the original Circle of Sisters column from Meridian Magazine. By the next two years, many multi-author blogs were launched, including Times and Seasons, By Common Consent, Feminist Mormon Housewives, and Millennial Star. On March 23, 2004, due to an article in The Revealer, the writer Kaimi Wenger at the LDS blog Times and Seasons noticed that the Jewish and Catholic blogging communities had adopted names for themselves. In a blog post titled The Nameless Mormon Blogosphere, Wenger sought to remedy this situation and asked for suggestions for a name. Christopher Bradford posting under the name Grasshopper suggested Bloggernacle Choir, the shortened version of which gained wide approval. Bloggernacle is a term that has been used commonly by LDS bloggers. The Latter-day Saint apologetic organization FairMormon features a website and blog; Jeff Lindsay began a Latter-day Saint apologetic blog entitled Mormanity in 2004. A Mormon litblog named A Motley Vision was founded in 2004 by William Morris. During 2005, several LDS-themed podcasts entered the Bloggernacle to augment Latter-day Saint blogging with audio programming; these included podcasts produced by church affiliated sources and an independent series, Mormon Stories Podcast, produced by John Dehlin who also founded the blog Stay LDS and the group blog Mormon Matters. Stay-at-home mothers who are LDS and who blog are known to comment occasionally upon their religion; two such writers whose blogs have become popular with non-Mormon audiences are Stephanie Nielson, of the blog the NieNie Dialogues, C. Jane Kendrick of CJane Enjoy It, and Jana Mathews who blogs at Momlogic as The Meanest Mom. A spoof on this genre of blog is the blog Seriously, so Blessed!, written by an anonymous Utah woman. In 2009, the religious news site Religion Dispatches ran a story about the phenomenon of Mormon mommy blogging, which its author believed arose in part in response to Elder M. Russell Ballards 2007 commencement address at Brigham Young UniversityHawaii, which had lauded efforts by Mormon faithful to share their beliefs through such means as blogging, citing an online post by Bookslinger pseudonymous author of the blog Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon. Mormon videographer Seth Adam Smith began blogging in 2004. Some of the Bloggernacles more prominent blogs are named after defunct Latter-day Saint publications. For example, Messenger and Advocate, a blog written by Guy Murray, was named after the LDS publication of the same name published 18341837 in Kirtland, Ohio. Keepapitchinin, a Mormon history blog written by Salt Lake Tribune columnist and independent historian Ardis Parshall that she founded in 2008, was named after a sporadically published humorous newspaper published 18671871 and pseudonymously written by three sons of LDS apostles, George J. Taylor, Joseph C. Rich, and Heber John Richards. Parshalls blog has won several Bloggernacle awards. Additionally, one of Parshalls Keepapitchinin posts received an Association for Mormon Letters award 2010. The blog Millennial Star was named after The Latter-day Saints Millennial Star, published in England 18401970; and the LDS history blog The Juvenile Instructor is the namesake of a publication intended as a catechism of Mormonism printed in Salt Lake City, Utah 18661930. Salt Lake City, Utahs The Deseret News began producing a separate, LDS-themed newspaper insert on January 10, 2008 named Mormon Times. The website version of this insert features readers feedback. The Mormon Times reporter covering the Bloggernacle is Emily W. Jensen. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints own internet presence is substantial, and former Church spokesman Michael Ottersons blogging contributions featured prominently in the LDS blogosphere as well. Linescratchers, an LDS contemporary music scene blog, also debuted in 2008. Neylan McBaine founded The Mormon Women Project in 2010. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latte",

In 1865 he was appointed professor at the Maximilians Gymnasium and received the Great Golden Medal from Maximilian II of Bavaria, for his chronological studies of the zodiac circle of Dendera and Manetho. From this recognition he was able to gain access to the collections at the court and library of king Ludwig I of Bavaria and study the royal collection of Egyptian artifacts held within. He later studied similar collections in Vienna, Trieste, Rome, Florence, Paris, London and Leiden focusing especially on the papyri. He made major contributions to the newly founded Journal of Egyptian Language and Antiquities. In 1869 he was appointed Honorary Professor of Egyptology, at Munich University and curator of the Egyptian collections. Some time later he began to be heavily criticized for the style of his writings. In the winter of 187273 he toured Egypt Cairo, Alexandria and Luxor which led to him publish some Travel letters, about his experiences there.

    "text": "Kilkenny is a township in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. It lies entirely within the White Mountain National Forest. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of zero. In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships which are different from towns, and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government if any, as many are uninhabited.  History  The town was granted to Jonathan Warner and others on June 4, 1774, containing 26,911 acres 108.90 km2. In 1840 it contained 19 inhabitants, and in 1856 it had 19 inhabitants and an area of 15,906 acres 64.37 km2, with a value of 20,000. It was named after the town and county of Kilkenny in Ireland. Kilkenny once included a large portion of what is now the eastern edge of Jefferson, tapering south into the area of Jefferson Notch at the foot of Mount Mitten. This included much of the area known as Jefferson Highland on the Portland Road present-day U.S. Route 2. By the 1870s, maps were showing the southern edge of Kilkenny as a line extending the border between Jefferson and Lancaster. The 1896 topographic map, however, shows that the boundary had again been adjusted several miles south, to include Mount Waumbek and Pliny Mountain, uninhabited areas. Deeds in this area often refer to the Kilkenny Addition. On the 1935 topographic map, the Upper Ammonoosuc Trail crossed Kilkenny along Priscilla Brook and through the pass from the Keenan Brook area of Randolph, north of Pliny Mountain. This trail has since been abandoned, although a 2002 atlas of New Hampshire shows a Priscilla Brook Trail in the same location. The Willard Bowl north of Mount Waumbek, drained by Garland Brook, was considered as a site for development of a ski area in 1971, when it was owned by former governor Hugh Gregg. On the 1896 topographic map, there was a BM railroad spur up much of Garland Brook, to an elevation of 2,100 feet 640 m. By 1935, the tracks were gone.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 25.7 square miles 66.6 km2, of which 0.02 square miles 0.05 km2, or 0.08, are water. Kilkenny is home to Mount Waumbek of the Pliny Range and Mount Cabot of the Pilot Range, each over 4,000 feet 1,200 m high see Four-thousand footers, as well as several other peaks over 3,000 feet 910 m. The summit of Mount Cabot is the highest point in Kilkenny, at 4,160 feet 1,270 m above sea level. The township is entirely within the Connecticut River watershed. The southern end of the township, as well as the west side of the Pilot Range, drain west via Fox Brook, Bunnell Brook, Garland Brook, and Priscilla Brook to the Israel River, which joins the Connecticut at Lancaster, while the northern end of the township, including the east side of the Pilot Range and its north end, drain to the Upper Ammonoosuc River, which flows north and west to join the Connecticut at Groveton.  Adjacent municipalities  Stark north Milan northeast Berlin east Randolph southeast Jefferson south Lancaster west  Climate   Demographics  As of the 2020 census, there were no people living in the township.

At the AIR Awards of 2025, the album was nominated for Best Independent Dance or Electronica Album or EP.  Background  The album title was announced alongside the release of AEIOU.  Critical reception  Jack Tregoning from The Guardian said Whats immediately obvious about Hyperbolic is that its prefabbed for the Spotify age, with six of its ten songs previously released, leaving just four for fans to discover anew. Its not so much an album with a deeply considered build, but rather a neat container for playlistable songs. Tregoning also said Pnau just wants to feel good all the time  subtlety be damned. Cyclone Wehner from The Music said Pnaus sixth album, Hyperbolic, diverges from Changa. Its pop, rather than festival-orientated, but its still about communal celebration. Wehner said Pnau are the Australian answer to Daft Punk. Chris Lamaro from AAA Backstage said Hyperbolic is a testament to Pnaus evolution, traversing from their roots in underground raves to the realms of disco-infused pop anthems, yet always anchored by their signature dancefloor essence, solidifying their position as electronic music maestros.

    "text": "HareClark is a type of single transferable vote electoral system of proportional representation used for elections in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. With its use in 1909, it was one of the first uses of the Gregory method for transfers of winners surplus votes. The name is derived from the names of English barrister Thomas Hare, the original inventor of single transferable voting, and Attorney-General of Tasmania Andrew Inglis Clark, who introduced a modified form to Tasmania in 1896.  History  Thomas Hare 18061891 is generally credited with the conception of the single transferable vote, while Andrew Inglis Clark 18481907 introduced the system to Tasmania with a modified counting method. The specific modification introduced by Mr. A.I. Clark, Attorney-General for Tasmania, is the provision devised by him for eliminating the element of chance in the selection and distribution of quota-excesses or surplus transfer votes. The provision described as Clarks own was the Gregory method later also adopted for the 1925 election of the Irish Senate, to transfer all votes to next order of preference the next usable marked preference, rather than a random sample. In 1896, after several failed attempts, Clark succeeded in having a system of proportional representation adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament. It was accepted only on a trial basis in the two main cities, Hobart to elect 6 MPs and Launceston to elect 4 MPs. This first Hare-Clark system, as it was immediately known, was renewed annually until suspended in 1902. Clark, never in robust health, died at his home Rosebank in Battery Point on 14 November 1907, just as the adoption of permanent proportional representation struggled through Parliament and over a year before it was used for the first time throughout Tasmania in the 1909 Tasmanian state election. Districts were used not state-wide districting, and district magnitude was five in each district - each district elected five members. Hare-Clark has been used continuously for Tasmanian state elections since 1909 for the House of Assembly. Tasmanias Legislative Council is elected by Instant-runoff voting, the same system as is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives. In the 1901 Australian federal election, the Hare-Clark system was used to elect 5 members for the Division of Tasmania, as the Federal voting rules were determined by the State. The Hare-Clark System was implemented to elect the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in the 1920 elections. However Jack Lang changed the electoral system back to first past the post in single member electorates prior to the 1927 state election. The Hare-Clark System has been used to elect the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly since 1992.  Evolution  Features of Hare-Clark have evolved over time. Until 1942, candidates were listed in alphabetic order rather than grouped together by party. Robson Rotation, where the order candidates appeared on ballot papers is randomised, was introduced in 1980. This had the effect of reducing any advantage a candidate had by appearing at the top of a party list, so as to eliminate any influence of donkey votes. As well, district magnitude the number of seats used in districts has changed since 1896.  Counting  After a candidate reaches a quota and is elected, all of their ballot papers are redistributed to elect additional candidates based on the voters next preferences indicated on each ballot paper. The redistributed votes have a reduced transfer value, which is determined by the relationship of the number of surplus votes received by the previously elected candidate compared to the total votes he or she holds. In a round that starts with no candidate holding un-transferred surplus votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their preferences are transferred at full value to the next usable preference marked on each ballot. Ballot papers with non-transferable votes are set aside during this process. The process of conducting the vote count in Hare-Clark and Australian Senate style systems is largely similar, with only minor differences. Prior to the 2016 Australian federal election, group voting tickets were used for Senate elections. This allowed parties to determine the order in which preferences would be distributed to other candidates. This option for voters to have their preferences determined by group voting tickets is still in use in Victoria. In contrast, under Hare-Clark, preferences are always explicitly determined by individual voters, and there is no above the line voting option.  Counting method with example  1. Initial count Any invalid votes are excluded e.g. no boxes marked and then the first preferences from each ballot paper is tallied. They are allocated to marked candidate. Each candidates total is announced. 2. Determining the quota The total count of valid votes is",

    "text": "The Lenin League German: Leninbund was a German revolutionary socialist organisation that was active during the later period of the Weimar Republic. Founded in 1928 by former left communist members of the Communist Party of Germany KPD, it experienced a number of splits over the years before going underground in the wake of the Reichstag fire and finally disappearing by the outbreak of World War II.  History  The Lenin League was formed at the beginning of April 1928, its members initially around 6,000 were mostly former members of the Communist Party of Germany KPD who were excluded from the party after the ultra-left and the left wing were ousted by the leadership under Ernst Thälmann. Among them were several Left Communist members of the Reichstag and the Prussian Landtag and other prominent members of the party such as Ruth Fischer, Arkadi Maslow, Werner Scholem, Paul Schlecht, Hugo Urbahns and Guido Heym. The founding members expressed their solidarity with the positions of the United Opposition around Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev in the Soviet Union, and criticized various aspects of the policies of the Communist International and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union e.g. the Stalinist line of socialism in one country and the alliance with the Kuomintang in China as revisionist deviations. Before the 1928 German federal election, the organization experienced its first major split when, with the exception of Hugo Urbahns who led the Lenin League to its end, all of its prominent politicians left the organization because of the surrender of Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev to the majority positions in the USSR and the participation in the elections being seen as premature. The result of the 1928 election 0.26; 80,230 votes was therefore disappointing. The slow but steady process of disintegration soon became unstoppable, especially as the KPD violently attacked the Lenin League within the framework of the politics of the Third Period, where any non-Communist workers organization was labeled as fascist. Individual members like Fritz Schimanski joined the KPD, and others like Guido Heym joined the SPD, so the Lenin League shrank to around 1,000 members. The Lenin League remained important only in a few localities, in Dortmund, Neu-Isenburg, Brunsbüttelkoog, and some cities of Brandenburg such as Bernau and Rathenow, where it was represented in the local parliaments. In the Rhineland and Berlin, some of Karl Korschs supporters joined the organization after their own structures were formally dissolved. In 1930, however, the truly Trotskyist wing around Anton Grylewicz split after controversies over the question of the reformability of the KPD and the Comintern and the character of Soviet foreign policy, and formed under the name of Left Opposition of the KPD. Recognizing early on the danger for the workers movement of the growth of the National Socialist German Workers Party NSDAP, the Lenin League was involved in various attempts from 1930 onwards to build a united front of the SPD and KPD workers parties against fascism, which only succeeded in intensified cooperation with other small left-wing organizations such as the Communist Party of Germany Opposition KPO and Socialist Workers Party of Germany SAPD. After several bans on its press in 1932 the newspaper Volkswille, initially published daily in 1928, three times a week from 1928 to 1930, weekly from 1930 to 1932 and every two weeks until the final ban, and the theoretical organ, the Fahne des Kommunismus, every two weeks, the organization had to go underground after the Reichstag fire in 1933. Unlike other small left-wing organizations, however, the Lenin League failed to establish a functional foreign leadership a group of exiles led by Hugo Urbahns existed in Stockholm or centralized illegal structures. Regional Lenin League resistance groups were active in various regions such as Hamburg, Thuringia or the Ruhr area, often in cooperation with other leftist organizations. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, their traces were lost.  References   Bibliography  Marcel Bois: Im Kampf gegen Stalinismus und Faschismus.

    "text": "John Roach Straton surname rhymes with Dayton; April 6, 1875  October 29, 1929 was an American Fundamentalist Baptist pastor. Straton was the son of the Reverend Henry Dundas Douglas Straton and the former Julia Rebecca Carter of Virginia. He became a Christian when he was a teenager and heard the revival preaching of James Hawthorne.  Early life and education  Straton graduated from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia in 1898. He also attended Southern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1902 to 1903 as well as University of Chicago and the Boston School of Oratory.  Ministry  Straton was ordained in 1900 and spent most of his adult life as pastor of several churches in four major cities: Second Baptist in Chicago 19051908, Immanuel-Seventh Baptist in Baltimore 19081913, First Baptist in Norfolk, Virginia 19141917, and most notably of the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City 19181929, which was the first church to operate its own radio station.Tell It From Calvary is a radio show that the church still produces weekly; its heard on WMCA AM570. Straton was supportive of the work of Uldine Utley, an immensely popular 14-year-old child preacher in the 1920s, and invited her to preach at Calvary Church. Along with William Bell Riley of Minnesota, Dr. Straton was one of the foremost leaders of the anti-evolution campaign of the 1920s. For years Straton carried on a feud with the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, New York City because of its Hall of the Age of Man, which displayed the remains of fossilized men. Straton charged the museum with mis-spending the taxpayers money, and poisoning the minds of school children by false and bestial theories of evolution. From December 1923 to May 1924, Dr. Straton engaged in a series of debates with the Modernist minister Charles Francis Potter of the West Side Unitarian Church. Friendly enemies, Straton and Potter debated the following subjects: 1 Resolved, that the Bible is the infallible word of God; 2 Resolved, that the world and man came by creation of a living God and not by evolution; 3 Resolved, that the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus Christ is an essential Christian doctrine; 4 Resolved, that Jesus Christ is the Divine Son of God; and 5 Resolved, that Jesus Christ will return in bodily presence to this earth and establish the reign of universal peace and righteousness. Later Straton published a book, The Famous New York Fundamentalist-Modernist Debates, which contained only his own speeches and omitted those of Potter. On June 28, 1924, he offered the opening invocation on the fifth day of the 1924 Democratic National Convention. During the Scopes Trial when the judge was considering letting scientists testify for the defense, William Jennings Bryan wired Straton to come to Dayton, Tennessee, to be a rebuttal witness. However, the judge ruled against the defense and Straton never went to Tennessee. After the trial and Bryans death, Straton challenged defense attorneys Clarence Darrow and Dudley Field Malone to debate, but was rebuffed. During the 1928 presidential campaign, Straton, along with William Bell Riley and J. Frank Norris, rallied opposition to Al Smith, the Roman Catholic nominee of the Democratic Party. In keeping with his strong opposition to the liquor traffic, Straton was one of the first to label Smith the candidate of rum, Romanism and rebellion, a phrase used unsuccessfully in 1884 against Grover Cleveland in the race against James G. Blaine. Huey Pierce Long, Jr., the governor of Louisiana in 1928 and a Smith supporter, claimed that Straton was being paid 500 a night for speeches on behalf of the Republican candidate, Herbert Hoover. Long accused Straton of waging war against white supremacy in the American South. Long said that he respected all clergymen and denominations but not when political considerations entered therein. Stratons health was broken by his intense schedule during the campaign, and in April 1929 he suffered a slight paralytic stroke, which led to a nervous breakdown brought on by overwork in the fall and finally a fatal heart attack on October 29, 1929. Straton married the former Georgia Hillyer of Atlanta, Georgia, on November 2, 1903, and they had four sons: Rev. Hillyer Hawthorne Straton, John Charles Straton, Rev. Warren Badenock Straton, and George Douglas Straton.  References   External links  Works by or about John Roach Straton at the Internet Archive Sermons of Dr. John Roach Straton",

    "text": "The Kingdom of Serbia was one of the major parties in the two Balkan Wars 8 October 1912  18 July 1913, gaining land in both conflicts. It experienced significant territorial gains in the Central Balkans, nearly doubling its territory. During the First Balkan War, most of the Kosovo Vilayet was taken by Serbia, while parts of the region of Metohija were taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro, a close ally. Over the centuries, populations of ethnic Serbs and Albanians tended to shift following territorial handovers. As a result of the multi-ethnic composition of Kosovo, the new administration provoked a mixed response from the local population. The ethnic Albanian population did not welcome Serbian rule and many were forced to flee the country. Kosovo Vilayet was agreed to be incorporated into Serbia and northern Metohija was agreed to be incoperated into Montenegro at the Treaty of London in May 1913. Disagreements regarding the territory of Macedonia among the members of the Balkan League led to the Second Balkan War, during which Serbia, Greece, Romania, Montenegro, and the Ottomans fought against Bulgaria in 1913. The new borders were ratified at the Treaty of Bucharest the same year. Serbia gained control over the land that became known as Vardar Macedonia Present-day North Macedonia. In 1918, Serbia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.  Background  Serbian Chetnik Organization  Balkan League  Following Italys victory in the Italo-Turkish War 29 September 1911  18 October 1912, the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and expand their empire. With the initial support of Russian agents, a series of agreements were reached between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while the empire could enlist reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways at the time was unusable, so most reinforcement would have to come by ship through the Aegean Sea. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny the use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912. Montenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. While refusing to enter into any such deal with Greece, Bulgaria negotiated treaties with Serbia to partition the area of northern Macedonia. According to Bulgarian strategy, the agreement would restrict Serbias access to Macedonia while allowing Bulgaria to unilaterally capture as much as its troops could without regard to Greek interests. Bulgaria thought it could occupy the larger part of Aegean Macedonia and the important port city of Salonika before the Greeks could get there. This alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable for all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912 to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October 25 September O.S.. Following an ultimatum for the Ottoman Empire, the remaining alliance members entered the conflict on 17 October.  Order of battle in the First Balkan War   Battles  First Balkan War 19121913 Battle of Kumanovo Battle of Prilep Battle of Bitola Siege of Adrianople Siege of Scutari Second Balkan War Battle of Bregalnica Battle of Pirot Battle of Kalimanci Battle of Vidin  Fall of Adrianople and Serbo-Bulgarian friction  The failure of the Şarköy-Bulair operation and the deployment of the 2nd Serbian Army together with its much-needed heavy siege artillery sealed Adrianoples fate. On 11 March, after a two weeks bombardment that destroyed many fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. Under the command of General Nikola Ivanov, the Bulgarian 2nd Army with 106,425 men and two Serb divisions with 47,275 men conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties. The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Richard Hall notes that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the Turkish historians note that 28,500-man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured including the unspecified number of wounded. Bulgarian losses for the entire Adrianople campaign amounted to 7,682. This was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war, even though it is speculated that the",

    "text": "Envigado Fútbol Club Spanish pronunciation: embiˈɣaðo ˈfuðβol ˈkluβ is a Colombian professional football team based in Envigado, that currently plays in the Categoría Primera B. They play their home games at the Estadio Polideportivo Sur. The club is renowned for the quality of its youth development and the number of international stars who have begun their careers with the team including James Rodríguez, Fredy Guarín, Juan Fernando Quintero, Jhon Córdoba, Mateus Uribe, Giovanni Moreno, Jhon Duran among others. It is frequently considered one of the best youth academies in South America, which is why it is known as Cantera de Heroes Quarry of Heroes.  History  The club was founded on 14 October 1989 and became the first team to earn promotion to the Colombian top flight as they won the inaugural Categoría Primera B tournament, held in 1991. In that tournament, they topped the final group ahead of Alianza Llanos, Club El Cóndor, and Atlético Huila. Envigado were able to consolidate themselves as a Primera A team, reaching the final stages of the league for the first time in 1994 after placing eighth. They were eliminated in the semifinals, placing third in their group. They also made it to the final stages of the competition in the 2002 Apertura, in which they also placed third in their semifinal group, and the 2005 Apertura, in which they placed second in their group, one point behind the eventual finalists Santa Fe. Envigado were relegated from the Primera A on 12 November 2006 after a 10 loss to Cúcuta Deportivo on the final round of the 2006 Finalización tournament, thus ending a 15-year spell in the top flight, but quickly bounced back by winning the 2007 Primera B tournament with a team led by debutant playmakers James Rodríguez and Giovanni Moreno and managed by Jesús Barrios. Envigado secured promotion back to the top flight by beating Academia in the finals of both of the seasons short tournaments. The team was at risk of relegation in the following seasons, playing relegation play-offs in 2008 and 2010, but they defended successfully their Primera A status in both of them. They made their best campaign in the top flight in the 2011 season, when they made it to the quarter-finals of both the Apertura and Finalización tournaments, which helped them place third in the seasons aggregate table and achieve their first qualification for an international tournament, the 2012 Copa Sudamericana. There they were eliminated at the second stage after beating Unión Comercio from Peru 20 on aggregate and losing to Liverpool from Uruguay 21 on aggregate. In November 2014, Envigado F.C. and its major shareholder Juan Pablo Upegui were included into the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List also known as the Clinton List by the United Statess Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC due to their links with the drug cartel Oficina de Envigado Envigado Office. Although not all of the clubs transactions were found to be illicit, the U.S. Treasury verified that the club had been used by the organization for money laundering, after 10 years of investigations. Envigado was removed from the list on 26 April 2018, and shortly after it was announced that 55 of the clubs shares had been sold to the equity fund ProFútbol. In 2025, and following poor campaigns in the preceeding seasons, Envigado ended a 17-year spell in the top flight as they were relegated to the second tier for the second time in their history. Their relegation was confirmed with six matches left in the season after they lost 21 to Atlético Bucaramanga on 4 October.

    "text": "Camberwell station is a railway station operated by Metro Trains Melbourne on the Alamein, Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are part of the Melbourne rail network. It serves the eastern suburb of Camberwell, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Camberwell station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform connected by a ramp and accessible overground concourse. It opened on 3 April 1882, with the current station provided in 1919.  History  Camberwell station opened on 3 April 1882, when the railway line was extended from Hawthorn. It remained the terminus of the line for a few months in that year, until the railway was extended to Lilydale. When the first section of the Outer Circle line opened in 1891, a new station was built at East Camberwell, to provide an interchange. However, the Outer Circle line quickly failed. By 1898, only the section from East Camberwell to Ashburton remained in operation later extended to Alamein in 1948, and services for Ashburton began to depart from Camberwell. In the late 1910s, the line from Hawthorn to Camberwell was regraded, to ease the steep gradient facing down services. Steam locomotives could not pull a fully laden train between the two stations, so peak-hour services had to be split. The locomotive would bring one set of carriages to Camberwell, then return for the other set, causing significant delays. With the regrading, the tracks at Camberwell were sunk into a cutting and the existing station was demolished. In 1919, the current Federation-style station buildings were provided, when the works were completed. Immediately east of the station, the Alamein line diverges south, with a flyover carrying the southbound line over the Lilydale and Belgrave lines. This flyover was provided in 1959, when the line was duplicated to Riversdale. In 1963, a third line was provided between Hawthorn and Camberwell and, in 1964, the third line was extended to East Camberwell. Also occurring in November of that year, the signal box at Camberwell was the first in Victoria to have push-button signalling installed. In 1972, the centre track was extended to East Camberwell and, in 1974, the platforms were renumbered to their current arrangement. At around 7:20am on 9 August 1975, a Tait train set rolled away from the station prior to operating an Alamein service. It occurred after the driver and guard left the train and went into the station building. It reached speeds of up to 30kph before it slowed to walking speed near Flinders Street, allowing a drivers supervisor to jump aboard and stop the train. No passengers were onboard at the time. On 27 April 1996, Camberwell was upgraded to a premium station. In 1997, four stabling sidings were constructed on the site of the former goods yard, to replace sidings that were removed at Jolimont Yard, with the sidings brought into service on 5 January 1998. The stabling sidings had been first proposed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority The Met in the mid-1980s.  Redevelopment controversy  In 2001, the Victorian State Government launched a new metropolitan planning strategy, Melbourne 2030, which proposed intensification of development around public transport nodes, such as railway stations and tram routes, along with limits on such development in residential neighbourhoods. The precinct around the station was identified as one of a number of activity centres earmarked for redevelopment. In March 2003, VicTrack announced plans to develop the airspace over the site, including the construction of a deck over the station platforms and adjacent stabling yard, with 34 levels of car park, and 34 storeys of commercial space. The original plans, involving the stations demolition, led to protests from the local community. They received a significant amount of media attention, with actor Geoffrey Rush and comedian Barry Humphries publicly backing the campaign, and heading a protest march up Burke Road from Camberwell Junction to the station. The comedian performed a poem about planners at the rally, and noted that the railway line was sometimes called The Orient Express. To those supporting development of the station, the actions of the protesters were seen as an example of NIMBYism. The Boroondara Residents Action Group worked with architects McGauran Giannini Soon to provide alternative ideas for developing the air-space over the station and yard that were more in-keeping with their view of community preferences, including a small public plaza and a new public library, with some small-scale shops. Although the station is historic, it is not protected by any of the states heritage listings for any architectural or cultural reasons, and failed to gain that protection when nominated to the Victorian Heritage Register by local residents groups. In July 2009, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approved a nine-story development on the site, pr",

    "text": "The spectacled cormorant or Pallass cormorant Urile perspicillatus is an extinct marine bird of the cormorant family of seabirds that inhabited Bering Island and possibly other places in the Commander Islands and the nearby coast of Kamchatka in the far northeast of Russia. The modern distribution was shown to be a relict of a wider prehistoric distribution in 2018 when fossils of the species from 120,000 years ago were found in Japan. It is the largest species of cormorant known to have existed.  Taxonomy  It was formerly classified in the genus Phalacrocorax, but in 2021, the IOC reclassified it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus Urile, based on a 2014 study that supported reclassifying the Brandts, red-faced, and pelagic cormorants into that genus. Although the spectacled cormorant was not mentioned in the 2014 study and its current taxonomic position is unresolvable by the current phylogenies, it was also reclassified into Urile based on its perceived relatedness to those species.  Description  The species was first identified by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741 on Vitus Berings disastrous second Kamchatka expedition. He described the bird as large, clumsy and almost flightless  though it was probably reluctant to fly rather than physically unable  and wrote they weighed 1214 pounds, so that one single bird was sufficient for three starving men. Though cormorants are normally notoriously bad-tasting, Steller says that this bird tasted delicious, particularly when it was cooked in the way of the native Kamchadals, who encased the whole bird in clay, buried it, and baked it in a heated pit. With a body mass estimated to be from 3.5 to 6.8 kg 7.7 to 15.0 lb and a length up to around 100 cm 39 in, the spectacled cormorant was rather larger than all other known cormorants. In a similar fashion to the extant flightless cormorant, which may have rivaled it in length but not weight, the spectacled cormorant is thought to have at least largely lost the power of flight which is borne out by the reduced sternum and wing chord of museum specimens. This species was largely glossy black in color with a reported greenish gloss that may have been fairly vivid in bright light. A contrasting large white patch could be seen on its lower flanks just above the legs. Like other cormorants, they had small patches of bare skin about the face including a small gular patch and a small amount of bare skin around the eyes; these areas usually appeared to have been dull-yellow or grayish in hue, but during breeding stages, they may have changed to a bright orangey-reddish hue. During breeding stages, they also had a prominent crest on their head. The bare skin around the eyes, as well as the crest, were not present in females.  Extinction  Apart from the fact that it fed on fish, almost nothing else is known about the life history of this bird. The population declined quickly after further visitors to the area started collecting the birds for food and feathers. Their reports of profitable whaling grounds and large populations of Arctic foxes and other animals with valuable pelts led to a massive influx of whalers and fur traders into the region; the last birds were reported to have lived around 1850 on Kamen Ariy Russian: Камень Арий islet, off the northwestern tip of Bering Island. Only seven known specimens are currently preserved in public collections, with all specimens collected and given away by the same individual. None of these specimens are available on public display. A presumed prehistoric record from Amchitka Island, Alaska, is based on misidentification of double-crested cormorant remains.

It was released digitally on September 16, 2014, and physically on September 18, 2014, by SM Entertainment.  Background and release  Holler debuted at number 1 on both Gaons weekly chart and Billboard World Albums chart. As a result, TTS became the third Korean artist and the first female one to have at least two albums at number 1 on the latter chart. The group previously achieved the number 1 spot two years back, with their debut release, Twinkle. They made their first comeback performance in a showcase at the Olympic Parks Woori Financial Art Hall in Seoul, performing various songs, including tracks from their previous album. During an interview with Billboard, the three singers expressed, This album was really personal for us and it was fun...to put out a much more raw side of our music...the music we put together has so much more layers, so much more depth to it in terms of sound, choruses or harmonizing together....Our main goal was to not be visually entertaining, but be vocally entertaining. They further described the album as an edgier, more mature version of its predecessor, Twinkle, and stated, We want to make feel good songs that are relatable, we want to make albums that are more natural...and speak from the bottom of our hearts. The trio revealed that Taeyeon took responsibility for the song selection, Seohyun penned the lyrics to the song, Only U, while Tiffany served as the visual director to the overall album image and the concept of Holler music video. The release of the album coincided with the broadcast of TTSs reality television show, The TaeTiSeo; thus, some footage of the album preparation was shown. The group performed various songs for their promotional activities, including Holler, Whisper, Only U, and Adrenaline. They achieved two Number 1 wins on Mnets M Countdown, one win on MBCs Music Core, one win on SBSs Inkigayo, and one win on KBSs Music Bank. The group made some radio and television appearances such as on MBCs Sunnys FM Date, or KBS2s You Hee-yeols Sketchbook, where they sang a rendition of Destinys Childs Cater 2 U.  Singles  The single track Whisper was released on September 13, peaking at number 4 on Gaons weekly chart. The title track, Holler peaked at number 3 on Gaons weekly chart and number 6 on Billboards World digital song chart. Tiffany described it as a rhythmical song that has a big brass sound that stands out with a funky groove, soul, and is overflowing with energy. Its music video became number 1 on YouTubes weekly Top 20 K-Pop Music Video Chart, and later the most viewed K-Pop video in America  around the world for September 2014. The song was initially given to Japanese singer Mizuki Watanabe under the title Hello Me!, which was a B-side of her 2007 single, Best Friend.

    "text": "Ubatuba is a Brazilian municipality, located on the northeast coast, in the state of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 92,819 2021 est. in an area of 723.88 km2, of which 83 is located in the Serra do Mar State Park. Ubatuba is one of fifteen municipalities in São Paulo that the state considers to be coastal resorts because they satisfy specific standards set by state legislation. This classification entitles these communities more money from the state for the development of regional tourism. In addition, the municipality gains the right to add the title of seaside resort to its name, a word used both in the official municipal file and in state references.  Toponymy  Its name is of Tupi origin, and it has at least two meanings. Ubá means canoe in Tupi, whereas uubá means river cane, which is a type of grass utilized by the indigenous people to make arrows. Because tyba means gathering, the citys name might refer to either gathering of river reeds or gathering of boats.  Geography  Ubatuba is linked with the Rodovia Longitudinal or the BR-101. It is located east of São Paulo and east-northeast of Santos and west of Rio de Janeiro. At latitude 232621.45, it is bounded to the north by Paraty Rio de Janeiro, to the south by Caraguatatuba, to the west by Cunha, São Luiz do Paraitinga, and Natividade da Serra, and to the east by the Atlantic Ocean. The city lies on the Tropic of Capricorn, which crosses just in front of the municipal airport runway. The urban area is mainly concentrated in the Atlantic and valley areas. The city frequently receives rain, hence the nickname Uba Chuva chuva being Portuguese for rain. Much of the land to the north is forested and mountainous, forming a part of the Serra do Mar mountains. Serra do Mar State Park was established in order to conserve and preserve the Atlantic Forest and covers 83 of the municipality, having a few connector roads through the mountain range and consisting of three centers within Ubatuba: Cunha-Indaiá, Santa Virgínia and Picinguaba. The municipality contains part of the Tupinambás Ecological Station, which protects some of the coastal islands. A marine park was created under Projeto TAMAR TAMAR Project to protect sea turtles. In addition, the Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo runs the Clarimundo de Jesus research base in Ubatuba.  Climate  Ubatuba has a tropical rainforest climate Köppen: Af. It rains during the entire year, more frequently during summer, with the rainfall about 2,520 millimetersyear. It has no dry season.  Tourism  Ubatuba is an important tourist city, receiving tourists from many parts of Brazil and served by Gastão Madeira Airport. Ubatuba features over 100 beaches. Among these are Maranduba, Lázaro, Itamambuca, Vermelha, Grande, Enseada, Perequê and Saco da Ribeira. Ubatuba also features an island named Anchieta after José de Anchieta. It has been a nature preserve since March 22, 1977. Ubatuba is considered, by law, as The Surf Capital of São Paulo State. The city has received this honour because more than ten important surf contests are held off its beaches every year, including two world qualifying series, two Super Surf Pro series, and other competitions supported by such well-established brands as Billabong, Quiksilver and Dunkelvolk which sponsored the 2009 edition of Ubatuba Surf Contest with more than 120 athletes. Lately, the city has also been known by its biodiversity, especially in relation to birds. There are more than 565 different bird species already identified within the city as of April 2012.  History  Ubatuba was the place where the Portuguese signed the first treaty of peace of the Americas with the Tupinambá native tribe The Yperoig Peace Treaty - Tratado de Paz de Iperoig, a treaty that kept Brazil in Portuguese hands, with only one language and one faith Catholicism. Back in the 16th century, the Tupinambá families were forced into slavery, working on sugar cane plantations along the Southern Shores surrounding the towns of São Vicente and Itanhaém, a region also called Morpion at that time according to André Thévet - Singularités de la France Antarctique. The Tupinambá responded to this outrage with the Tamoio Confederation, a powerful military alliance that stood to destroy São Vicente, with the help of the French, who had founded a Protestant refugee colony, France Antarctique in Guanabara Bay before the foundation of Rio de Janeiro. The Portuguese sent two Jesuit priests, Fathers Anchieta and Nobrega, to Ubatuba a tribe named Yperoig, to make peace with the Tupinambá Indians. Anchieta was kept as a hostage and Nobrega returned to Saint Vincent along with the Chief Cunhambebe to make arrangements for the final Treaty. The Portuguese won, destroying France Antarctique and keeping the land.  Population history in numbers   Media  In t",

    "text": "James Wood-Mason December 1846  6 May 1893 was an English zoologist. He was the director of the Indian Museum at Calcutta, after John Anderson. He collected marine animals and lepidoptera, but is best known for his work on two other groups of insects, phasmids stick insects and mantises praying mantises. The genus Woodmasonia Brunner, 1907, and at least ten species of phasmids, are named after him.  Life and career  Wood-Mason was born in Gloucestershire, England, where his father was a doctor. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Queens College, Oxford. He went out to India in 1869 to work in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, which in 2008 still housed his collection of insects. In 1872 he sailed to the Andaman Islands, mostly studying marine animals, but also collecting and later describing two new phasmids, Bacillus hispidulus and Bacillus westwoodii. Wood-Mason described 24 new species of phasmids, mostly from South Asia but also some from Australia, New Britain, Madagascar, the Malay peninsula and Fiji. His naming of Cotylosoma dipneusticum Wood-Mason, 1878 is particularly curious as he never formally described the species; it was wrongly imagined to be semi-aquatic; it was described with what is probably the least precise measurement ever used for a phasmid, namely between three and four inches in length; and he gave its locality as Borneo, when in fact it came from Fiji. In 1887 he became Superintendent of the Indian Museum. Also in 1887, he became vice-president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1888 he sailed on the Indian Marine Survey steamship HMS Investigator, working on and later describing new species of Crustacea, along with Alfred William Alcock, who recorded the voyage in his classic natural history book A Naturalist in Indian Seas 1902. For several years he suffered from Brights disease. On 5 April 1893, unable to work, he left India for England, but died at sea on 6 May 1893.  Flower mantis drawing  Wood-Mason gave his flower mantis drawing to Alfred Russel Wallace, who wrote in his 1889 book Darwinism: A beautiful drawing of this rare insect, Hymenopus bicornis in the nymph or active pupa state, was kindly sent me by Mr. Wood-Mason, Curator of the Indian Museum at Calcutta. A species, very similar to it, inhabits Java, where it is said to resemble a pink orchid. Other Mantidae, of the genus Gongylus, have the anterior part of the thorax dilated and coloured either white, pink, or purple; and they so closely resemble flowers that, according to Mr. Wood-Mason, one of them, having a bright violet-blue prothoracic shield, was found in Pegu by a botanist, and was for a moment mistaken by him for a flower. See Proc. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1878, p. liii. Wallace passed the drawing to Edward Bagnall Poulton, who published it in his 1890 book The Colours of Animals.  Honours  Wood-Mason was a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society. In 1888 he became a Fellow of the University of Calcutta. Over 10 marine animals have the specific name woodmasoni in his honour, including several described by Alcock of the Investigator : Heterocarpus woodmasoni, Coryphaenoides woodmasoni, Thalamita woodmasoni, and Rectopalicus woodmasoni. Two species of snake are named in his honour: Oligodon woodmasoni and Uropeltis woodmasoni.  Publications  Entomological Notes. 1.

    "text": "SNP Students also known as the Federation of Student Nationalists is the student wing of the Scottish National Party SNP, representing students in Scottish higher education. It was formed in 1961 when various student organisations supportive of Scottish independence and the SNP in particular decided to join forces into a new constituent body. Unlike Young Scots for Independence, which is the youth wing of the SNP, the group is for those in higher education and membership is not restricted by age. The organisation has branches at most of Scotlands universities, and regularly campaigns for independence and a host of other policies across the country.  History  The organisation was formed in 1961 and key figures were Neil MacCormick and Allan Macartney who would both later become SNP members of the European Parliament. By 1975 the group had around 1,500 members in Scotland. It has played an active part in the affairs of the SNP and is represented on the partys National Executive Committee, in the past with a representative position shared with the Young Scots for Independence, but now each organisation has its own representative. The SNP Students can send up to 15 delegates to the SNP Annual National Conference and 6 delegates to meetings of its National Council. In the 2000 SNP leadership election the organisation supported Alex Neil who lost to John Swinney. In all subsequent leadership campaigns the organisation did not officially endorse any candidate. It has informal links with Plaid Ifanc, the youth wing of Plaid Cymru. Until its September 2019 conference, it was also a part of the European Free Alliance Youth. As of November 2021, they had a membership of 5,800 people who were at colleges and universities across Scotland.  Activity  SNP Students has been very active in recent years, organising high-profile campaigns on issues such as Equal Marriage, zero-hour contracts and the stripping of charitable status from fee-paying schools. In September 2008, during a debate at the University of Edinburgh, a student member stated that the SNP Students executive was opposed to the proposals from the SNP-led Scottish Government to raise the minimum purchase age for alcohol in off-sales from 18 to 21. In 2012, during the SNPs policy change on NATO membership of an independent Scotland, SNP Students publicly came out in favour of retaining the anti-NATO policy, however at SNP conference the vote was lost despite SNP Students delegates voting against, and as a result the SNP is now pro-NATO. At the SNP Students conference in 2015, they voted in favour of reintroducing rent controls in Scotland. At the SNP Students conference in September 2019, SNP Students voted to disaffiliate from the European Free Alliance Youth, citing a fundamental disagreement with the ethos of the organisation and expressing the desire to build relationships with mainstream social democratic forces in Europe instead. In 2019, SNP Students successfully campaigned for an end to graduation fees in Scotland, passing a resolution at the October 2019 SNP Conference calling on all universities in Scotland to abolish graduation fees. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, SNP Students campaigned with others for the introduction of a Summer SAAS, and a No Detriment Policy at Scotlands universities. On 31 December 2020, the day the Brexit transition period ended, SNP Students published a co-authored statement with the Scottish Young Liberals, Scottish Labour Students, and the Scottish Young Greens, condemning the UK Government for Brexit and calling for Scotland to continue as a member of the Erasmus scheme. In the SNPs manifesto for the 2021 Holyrood Election, the SNP committed to abolishing all core curriculum charges, implementing an SNP Students policy, pushed for at the 2020 National Conference. This came into effect on the 14 July 2021.

Surrounded by a 140-acre 57 ha campus, the Academys main building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. GBA is located in rural southeastern West Virginia. The Academy has been linked to multiple cases of child neglect, as well as the troubled teen industry. Greenbrier Academy announced plans to close on March 13, 2023.  School structure  The school is accredited by AdvancED and the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement, The school offers a traditional curriculum of high-school level Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, and various languages. The average class size is about ten students.  Extracurricular activities  The school also offers activities which include Yearbook Club, Running Club, Poetry Club, music lessons, basketball, skiing and outdoor adventures. The school also gives students the chance participate in service to the community and to go on service trips to Africa and Nicaragua.  Therapeutics  The school also offers a number of therapy programs, centered on a philosophy called Strong or Applied Relationality. This philosophy is not widely recognized and seems to be based on a book by the founder of the school, self-proclaimed guru and former lawyer L. Jay Mitchell see Controversy below. This philosophy claims that the primary cause of apparently any symptoms exhibited by adolescents is that her perceptions of past, present, and future relationsal experiences. According to the philosophy, Present perceptions of past experiences guide our behaviors and emotions and that through viewing things in the appropriate context, healing can happen. The philosophy appears to be similar to Social Cognitive Theory. As part of its therapeutic mission, the school offers animal therapy, a family program, and something the school calls Village which is based on a therapeutic construct called the Hermeneutic Circle. The school also offers continuing care through its Alumni network.  References   External links  Official website",

    "text": "Pencaitland is a village in East Lothian, Scotland, about 12 miles 19 kilometres south-east of Edinburgh, 5 mi 8 km south-west of Haddington, and 1 mi 2 km east of Ormiston. The land where the village lies is said to have been granted by William the Lion to Calum Cormack in 1169, who gave the church, with the tithes and other property belonging to it, to the monks of Kelso, in whose possession it remained till a short time prior to the accession of Robert Bruce. The land subsequently became the property of a younger branch of the Maxwell family, who granted the advowson and tithes to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey, who held them until the Reformation. The Tyne Water divides the village into Easter Pencaitland and Wester Pencaitland, crossed by a three-arched bridge dating from the 16th Century. An ancient cross in Wester Pencaitland indicates that a market was regularly held there. A large industrial maltings, which was built in 1965, is situated just before the entrance to the village at Wester Pencaitland.  Etymology  The name Pencaitland is first attested in 1296, as Penketland, Penkatlond and Penkatelen. It is thought derive either from the Brittonic language words corresponding to modern Welsh pen head, top, hill, coed wood, and llan clearing, enclosure, in which case it once meant head of a clearing or enclosure in or near a wood, or pen and coedlan copse, in which case it meant end of the copse.  Pencaitland Community Council  Pencaitland Community Council meets 10 times throughout the year, typically on the last Wednesday of the month at the Trevelyan Hall in Wester Pencaitland. The Community Council is constituted from fifteen members of the local population along with the locally elected representatives of the Faside catchment. This catchment extends to New Winton and Boggs Holdings to the north and Peastonbank to the south.  Winton Castle  12 mile 800 metres northwest of Pencaitland is Winton Castle, the original square Tower house being built in the 15th century on land granted to the Setons by David I c1152, and mentioned in a charter to them from William the Lion in 1169. It was burnt by the Earl of Hertfords forces during the Rough Wooing, and subsequently repaired, restored, and later enlarged by George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton, commencing in 1619. Architecturally, Winton is one of the most important houses in Scotland, due largely to the work of William Wallace, who was appointed the Kings Master Mason in 1617. This peculiar and beautiful structure, is situated on a steep embankment sloping down to the valley of the Tyne. Hunnewell The Lands of Scott says: this Jacobean mansion was that of Ravenswood in The Bride of Lammermoor. There is, of course, a ghost-room in the upper part of the house; but I saw nothing uncanny about it, twice that I was there. In 1630, Lord Winton had completed half of the house, beginning at Wallaces Tower, which had been burned, and continuing as far as Jacobs Tower. Another room, called the Kings Chamber, is said to have been occupied by Charles I when he came to Scotland to be crowned in 1633, although most records have him staying at Seton Palace. Thinking that better times were now at hand, the Earl of Winton caused to be carved on a fine stone tablet upon the frontispiece of his new building a crown supported by a thistle between two roses, signifying the union of Scotland and England. Under it he caused to be inscribed in deep letters of gold this Latin verse: Unio Nune Stoque Cadoque Tuis. Mylne makes a note upon this, saying: Ye Union was ye cause of the families ruin. The Wintons tenure lasted until 1715 when George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton engaged in supporting the Jacobites. He was captured and taken to the Tower of London, and ultimately forfeited his land. The Earls capture ended an era when kings were entertained and master craftsmen were engaged fresh from Edinburgh Castle to embellish Winton House in the style of the Scottish Renaissance. In the absence of the Earl but in his name, Winton was requisitioned by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 when his rebel army camped on the Winton estate. Winton is now the family home of Sir Francis and Lady Ogilvy.  Fountainhall  34 mile 1.2 kilometres south-west of Pencaitland is Fountainhall, a late 16th-century mansion extended in the early 17th century on the same intimate scale and with the same materials, fine-grained harlings matching the pale yellow sandstone of the chimneys, crowstep gables, and other dressings. The estates original name was Woodhead, and was purchased by John Pringle in 1635 who carried out extensive alterations and enhancements. On 13 August 1681 the estate was purchased by John Lauder of Newington, a rich Baillie of Edinburgh, for whom the house and lands were erected into the feudal barony of Fountainhall, becoming the seat of that family. Tradition states that the part of the property to the east contained a cour",

    "text": "Arthur Harrison Speedy Graubart December 8, 1901  August 12, 2003 was a United States Navy captain, and the last commander of the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen after the ships transfer as a war prize from Nazi Germanys Kriegsmarine to the US Navy.  Youth  Graubart was born in Albany, New York, as the youngest of three children to Hungarian and Austrian immigrants. His father was a salesman who came to America when he was 15 to avoid the draft. At an early age, Arthur Graubart showed an aptitude for mathematics and science, while his sister Ella Graubart went on to become the first female lawyer in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Charleston Harris High School in New York City in 1918. After the US declared war on Germany in 1917, Graubart, age 16, tried to enlist in the United States Marine Corps, but was recognized by an acquaintance of his father and sent home after two days. One day after his graduation from high school, he volunteered for service in the navy.  Early naval career  Graubart entered the United States Naval Academy in 1921, ser. number 59309. As a midshipman, he earned the nickname Speed or Speedy , when one of the members of the track team was injured and Graubart was asked to run in his place. Even though he crossed the finish line almost a half lap behind everyone else, he still earned a critical point for his team, so they nicknamed him Speed and it stuck with him. After graduation in 1925, his first assignment was on board the light cruiser USS Cincinnati, which in 1927 was involved in the Nicaragua Banana Fleet operations to protect American refugees during the countrys civil war. In 1927 Graubart reported to the Officers Submarine School at Naval Submarine Base New London. Upon completion, he was transferred to the submarine USS R-2, where he served until 1931. In 1932 Graubart was assigned to the submarine USS Barracuda for a three-year tour of duty. On November 24, 1938, he was transferred from Submarine Division 12 to Submarine Squadron 4, serving on the submarine USS Porpoise, where he served until 1939.  Assistant naval attaché in Nazi Germany  Graubart, fluent in German due to his family background, was transferred to Germany in 1931, where he studied with famous professors Adolph Nägel and Richard Mollier at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden, which was then Germanys top technology institute in diesel engines. At the time of his death, Graubart was the oldest living alumnus. On May 24, 1940, then Lieutenant Commander Graubart was appointed assistant naval attaché and became a very keen observer of German Naval tactics in the 1939-1941 period. Graubart was very well connected within the German Navy, and his dinners and Navy soirées became a meeting point of Anti-Nazi circles within the German Navy and of like-minded fellow students. He was in Berlin when Germany declared war on the United States. On December 11, 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo and held at Bad Nauheim prison. Friends in the German Navy intervened on his behalf and sent him extra provisions of food and drink. In mid-1942 he returned home in an exchange of political prisoners.  World War II  After his return from captivity, he was assigned commander of the submarine base in New Guinea, building this base up from scratch, supporting Americas Pacific campaign at the heart of submarine warfare. He served in Submarine Divisions in Perth and Brisbane, Australia. His excellent organizational skills, expertise in submarine diesel engines and the speedy repairs on his watch confirmed once again his nickname Speedy. In 1942, he was aboard USS Helm for testing new torpedoes. Mid-1944, he received orders to report to the Pentagon and became a member of the working group preparing the comprehensive manual on the German Armed Forces, titled U.S. War Department Technical Manual TM-E 30-451: Handbook on German Military Forces, first issued to troops in loose-leaf format from February 1945 on and published on 15 March, 1945. In late 1944, Graubart, by now promoted to captain, was posted to London and entered Germany with advancing U.S. troops in December 1944. Before the unconditional surrender, he was first flown to Frankfurt, then to Berlin, as member of what was to become the Tripartite Naval Commission. His CO, Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Germany since December 1944, sent Graubart as his representative to the official surrender of the German Navy at Field Marshal Bernard Montgomerys headquarters in Lüneburg, where Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, General Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, signed an instrument of surrender of all German armed forces in the Netherlands, northwest Germany and Denmark on 4 May 1945. Graubart was also present when the German surrender was signed at General Dwight D. Eisenhowers headquarters in Rheims on May 7, 1945, and at Marshal Georgiy Zhukovs headquarters in Berlin Karlshorst on May 8. Nicknamed the Beast",

    "text": "The Polynesian Triangle is a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: Hawaii Hawaiʻi, Easter Island Rapa Nui and New Zealand Aotearoa. This is often used as a simple way to define Polynesia. Outside the triangle, there are traces of Polynesian settlement as far north as Necker Island Mokumanamana, as far east as Salas y Gómez Island Motu Motiro Hiva, and as far south as Enderby Island Motu Maha. Also, there have once been Polynesian settlements on Norfolk Island and the Kermadec Islands Rangitahua. By the time the Europeans first arrived, these islands were all uninhabited. Today, the most numerous Polynesian peoples are the Māori, Hawaiians Kanaka Maoli, Tongans, Samoans, Niueans and Tahitians. The native languages of this vast triangle are Polynesian languages, which are classified by linguists as part of the Oceanic subgroup of Malayo-Polynesian. They ultimately derive from the proto-Austronesian language spoken in Southeast Asia 5,000 years ago. There are also numerous Polynesian outlier islands outside the triangle in neighboring Melanesia and Micronesia.  History  Anthropologists believe that all modern Polynesian cultures descend from a single protoculture established in the South Pacific by migrant Malayo-Polynesian people see also Lapita culture. There is also some evidence that Polynesians ventured as far east as Salas and Gómez Island and as far south as the sub-Antarctic islands to the south of New Zealand. However, none of these islands are considered part of Polynesia proper, as no viable settlements have survived. There are remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century on Enderby Island in the Auckland Islands. A shard of pottery was also recorded to have been found in the Antipodes Islands, but the Te Papa museum in Wellington has stated that they do not possess this shard and that the original description of the find did not say anything about its being Polynesian in origin. In contrast to the shape of a triangle, another theory states that the geography of Polynesian society and navigation pathways more accurately resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on Raiātea French Polynesia and tentacles spread out across the Pacific. In Polynesian oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as Taumata-Fee-Faatupu-Hau Grand Octopus of Prosperity, Tumu-Rai-Fenua Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth and Te Wheke-a-Muturangi The Octopus of Muturangi.

    "text": "The Niobid Painter was an ancient Athenian vase painter in the red-figure style who was active from approximately 470 to 450 BC. He is named after a calyx krater which shows the god Apollo and his sister Artemis killing the children of Niobe, who were collectively called the Niobids. The krater is known as the Niobid Krater and is now housed at the Louvre in Paris. In his other work he shows a preference for Amazonomachy scenes and three-quarter-view faces. His student Polygnotos continued his style of vase painting.  Name vase  The massacre of the Niobids by Apollo and Artemis is shown on side B of the Niobid Krater. This story is rarely represented in Greek art. Niobe had bragged that she was superior to the goddess Leto because she had seven boys and seven girls, while Leto was mother to just two children, Apollo and Artemis. To punish Niobe for her hubris, Leto sent Apollo and Artemis to kill all of Niobes children with arrows. It is uncertain what is being depicted on side A as none of the figures is labeled. Only Heracles and Athena are clearly recognized. There are several hypotheses about what the other figures represent. One option is that they are the Argonauts awaiting favorable winds in Iolcos. Alternatively the scene depicts the episode of Heracles descent into Hades to rescue Theseus and Pirithous, who were guilty of an attempted abduction of Persephone. Another possibility is that Heracles is a statue and that the men surrounding him are Athenian soldiers who wish to place themselves under the protection of the divine hero before the Battle of Marathon. The Athenians attributed their victory in that battle to the support of Heracles and instituted a cult to him. A single arrow in the lower right corner of side B probably protrudes from a dead Niobid hidden behind the landscape. The implied presence of a body which is not actually represented was a remarkable novelty in vase painting. The Niobid Painter also attempted to draw the scenes in three dimensional space by adding multiple levels to the landscape where the scenes take place. This change was inspired by contemporary wall and panel paintings which also used multiple level compositions. However, this feature did not become popular in vase painting and the rest of the Niobid Painters work used a single groundline.

    "text": "The Milesian tale Greek: Μιλησιακά, Milesiaka; Latin:fabula milesiaca, or Milesiae fabula is a genre of fictional story prominent in ancient Greek and Roman literature. According to most authorities, a Milesian tale is a short story, fable, or folktale featuring love and adventure, usually of an erotic or titillating nature. This resulted in a complicated narrative fabric: a travelogue carried by a main narrator with numerous subordinate tales carried by subordinate narrative voices. The best complete example of this would be Apuleiuss The Golden Ass, a Roman novel written in the second century of the Common Era. Apuleius introduces his novel with the words At ego tibi sermone isto Milesio varias fabulas conseram But let me join together different stories in that Milesian style, which suggests not each story is a Milesian tale, but rather the entire joined-together collection. The idea of the Milesian tale also served as a model for the episodic narratives strung together in Petroniuss Satyricon.  Aristidess Milesian Tale  The name Milesian tale originates from the Milesiaka of Aristides of Miletus Greek: Ἀριστείδης ὁ Μιλήσιος; fl. 2nd century BCE, who was a writer of shameless and amusing tales notable for their salacious content and unexpected plot twists. Aristides set his tales in Miletus, which had a reputation for a luxurious, easy-going lifestyle, akin to that of Sybaris in Magna Graecia; there is no reason to think that he was in any sense of Miletus himself. Later, in the first century BCE, the serious-minded historian Lucius Cornelius Sisenna translated Aristides into Latin under the title Milesiae fabulae Milesian Fables for an intellectual relaxation. Through this Latin translation of the work, the term Milesian tale gained currency in the ancient world. Milesian tales quickly gained a reputation for ribaldry: Ovid, in Tristia, contrasts the boldness of Aristides and others with his own Ars Amatoria, for which he was punished by exile. In the dialogue on the kinds of love, Erotes, Lucian of Samosataif in fact he was the authorpraised Aristides in passing, saying that after a day of listening to erotic stories he felt like Aristides, that enchanting spinner of bawdy yarns. This suggests that the lost Milesiaka had for its framing device Aristides himself, retelling what he had been hearing of the goings-on at Miletus. Plutarch, in his Life of Crassus, notes that after the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BCE, the victorious Parthians found collections of Milesian tales in the baggage of the Roman prisoners.  Legacy  Though the idea of the Milesian tale served as a model for the episodic narratives strung together in The Satyricon by Gaius Petronius Arbiter and The Golden Ass by Lucius Apuleius second century CE, neither Aristidess original Greek text nor the Latin translation survived. The lengthiest survivor from this literature is the tale of Cupid and Psyche, found in Apuleius, which Sir Richard Burton observed, makes us deeply regret the disappearance of the others. Aristidean saucy and disreputable heroes and spicy, fast-paced anecdote resurfaced in the medieval fabliaux. Chaucers The Millers Tale is in Aristides tradition. M. C. Howatson, in The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature 1989, voiced the traditional view the Milesian tale is the source of such medieval collections of tales as the Gesta Romanorum, the Decameron of Boccaccio, and the Heptaméron of Marguerite of Navarre. Gottskálk Jensson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, however, offered a dissenting view or corrective, arguing the original Milesian tale was: a type of first-person novel, a travelogue told from memory by a narrator who every now and then would relate how he encountered other characters who told him stories which he would then incorporate into the main tale through the rhetorical technique of narrative impersonation. In 2010, Nicholas Chong published retold Milesian tales in his book The Milesian and Malesian Tales, in which he mentions an Arcadian human sacrifice.  Notes",

    "text": "The actions by governments of communist states Marxist-Leninist states have been subject to criticism across the political spectrum. The actions of communist states have been especially criticized by anti-communists and right-wing critics, but also by other socialists such as anarchists, democratic socialists, libertarian socialists, orthodox Marxists, and Trotskyist communists. Communist states have also been challenged by domestic dissent. According to the critics, the actions and governance of communist parties within these states has often led to totalitarianism, political repression, restrictions of human rights, poor economic performance, and cultural and artistic censorship. Several authors noted gaps between official policies of equality and economic justice and the reality of the emergence of a new class in communist countries which thrived at the expense of the remaining population. In Central and Eastern Europe, the works of dissidents Václav Havel and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn gained international prominence, as did the works of disillusioned ex-communists such as Milovan Đilas, who condemned the new class or nomenklatura system that had emerged under communist states. Major criticism also comes from the anti-Stalinist left and other socialists. Its socio-economic nature has been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of bureaucratic collectivism, state capitalism, state socialism, or a totally unique mode of production. The governments of communist states have been criticized as authoritarian or totalitarian for suppressing and killing political dissidents and social classes so-called enemies of the people, religious persecution, ethnic cleansing, forced collectivization, and use of forced labor in concentration camps. Several communist states have also been accused of genocidal acts, such as in Cambodia, China, Poland and Ukraine, although there is scholarly dispute regarding the Holodomors classification as genocide. Especially in the West, criticism of communist states has also been grounded in criticism of socialism, by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who argued that the state ownership and planned economy characteristic of Soviet-style communism were responsible for economic stagnation and shortage economies, providing few incentives for individuals to improve productivity and engage in entrepreneurship. Anti-Stalinist left and other left-wing critics see it as an example of state capitalism and have referred to it as a red fascism contrary to left-wing politics. Other leftists, including MarxistLeninists, criticize them for repressive actions, while recognizing certain advancements such as egalitarian achievements and modernization under such states. Counter-criticism is diverse, including the view it presents a biased or exaggerated anti-communist narrative. Some academics propose a more nuanced analysis of the governance of communist states. Excess deaths under communist states have been discussed as part of a critical analysis of the governance of communist states. According to Klas-Göran Karlsson, discussion of the number of victims under communist states has been extremely extensive and ideologically biased. Any attempt to estimate a total number of killings by communist states depends greatly on definitions, ranging from a low of 1020 million to as high as 148 million. The criticism of some of the estimates are mostly focused on three aspects, namely that i the estimates are based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable; ii the figures are skewed to higher possible values; and iii those dying at war and victims of civil wars, Holodomor and other famines in communist states should not be counted. Others have argued that, while certain estimates may not be accurate, quibbling about numbers is unseemly. What matters is that many, many people were killed by communist regimes. Right-wing commentators argue that these excess deaths and killings are an indictment of communism, while opponents of this view, including members of the political left, argue that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes instead of communism, and point to mass deaths that they claim were caused by capitalism and anti-communism as a counterpoint to communist killings.  Background and overview  After the Russian Revolution, communist party rule was consolidated for the first time in Soviet Russia later the largest constituent republic of the Soviet Union, formed in December 1922 and criticized immediately domestically and internationally. During the first Red Scare in the United States, the takeover of Russia by the communist Bolsheviks was considered by many a threat to free markets, religious freedom and liberal democracy. Meanwhile, under the tutelage of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the only party permitted by the Soviet Union constitution, state institutions were intimately entwined",

    "text": "Blessing Oghnewresem Okagbare-Otegheri née Okagbare, born 9 October 1988 is a former Nigerian track and field athlete who specialized in long jump and sprints. She is an Olympic and World Championships medallist in the long jump and a world medalist in the 200 metres. Okagbare also holds the womens 100 metres Commonwealth Games record at 10.85 seconds. Her 100 m best of 10.79 made her the African record holder for the event until it was eclipsed by Murielle Ahouré in 2016. On June 17, 2021, Okagbare ran a wind-aided 10.63 100 m. She was the African record holder over the 200 m with a time of 22.04 seconds in 2018, thus making her the second-fastest African female athlete over the distance behind Christine Mboma, who ran an African record of 21.78 s in 2021. Okagbare was the African 100 m and long jump champion in 2010. She has also won medals at the All-Africa Games, IAAF Continental Cup and World Relays. In 2022 Okagbare was issued with an eleven-year competition ban backdated to July 2021 for multiple anti-doping rule violations.  Career   Early life  Of Urhobo heritage, Okagbare was born in Sapele, Delta, in Nigeria. Given her athletic physique, teachers and family encouraged her to take up sports. Initially, she played football as a teenager at her high school and later, in 2004, she began to take an interest in track and field. She participated in several disciplines early on, competing in the long jump, triple jump and high jump events at the Nigerian school championships and winning a medal in each. On the senior national stage, she was a triple jump bronze medalist at the 2004 Nigerian National Sports Festival. Okagbares first international outing came at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics, where she performed in the qualifying rounds of both the long and triple jump competitions. In May 2007, at the All-Africa Games trials in Lagos, she established a Nigerian record of 14.13 meters in the triple jump. At the 2007 All-Africa Games she won the silver medal in the long jump and finished fourth in the triple jump. In the latter competition her Nigerian record was beaten by Chinonye Ohadugha, who jumped 14.21 meters.  Olympic and African medals  As a 19-year-old, she won a silver medal in the womens long jump event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She was selected to compete at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics but did not start either the 100 m or long jump. Okagbare scored a 100 mlong jump double at the NCAA Womens Outdoor Track and Field Championship for University of Texas at El Paso, completing an undefeated collegiate streak for the UTEP Miners that year. She won the Nigerian 100 m title in 2010, running a time of 11.04 seconds, and stated that she was opting out of the long jump in order to save herself for the upcoming African championships. At the African Championships in 2010, she won gold in the long jump again with a distance of 6.62 m while her compatriot Comfort Onyali took silver. Okagbare also won gold in the 100 m distance with a run of 11.03 s flat, while Gabons Ruddy Zang Milama and compatriot Oludamola Osayomi won silver and bronze with runs of 11.15 s and 11.22 s respectively. She won her third gold at the end of the championship as part of the Nigerian 4100 m womens relay team. The team of Okagbare, Osayomi, Lawretta Ozoh and Agnes Osazuwa set a new championship record with a run of 43.43 s, more than a full second ahead of the silver-winning Cameroonian quartet. In 2011, Okagbare continued to build on her earlier endeavours by establishing herself as a 100 m runner. At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Okagbare placed fifth in the 100 m final with a run of 11.12 s. However, she did not make it to the final of the long jump as her best jump of 6.36 m was not enough to get her out of her qualifying group. She concluded her 2011 season by winning three medals at the All Africa Games in Maputo, Mozambique. She won silver in the 100 m behind compatriot Oludamola Osayomi with a run of 11.01 s and gold in the long jump with a jump of 6.50 m. She was part of the Nigerian quartet that won gold in the 4  100 m with a time of 43.34. 2012 was a busy year for Okagbare. She jumped 6.97 m in the long jump in Calabar during the Nigerian championship. She won new continental medals at the 2012 African Championships in Porto-Novo. In the 100 m, she was beaten to silver by Zang Milama, while in the long jump, she claimed gold with a jump of 6.96 m.  London 2012 and 2013 World Championships  At London 2012, Okagbare participated in her second Olympic Games. Going into the Olympics, she had run several fast 100 m races, and there was much anticipation and hope of a medal. However, the 2012 Olympics were not as successful for Okagbare as her 2008 outing. She established a new personal best of 10.92 s in the 100 m semi-final but placed eighth in the final with a run of 11.01 s. 2013 would prove to be a breakthrough year for Okagb",

    "text": "The Cleveland Institute of Art, previously Cleveland School of Art, is a private college focused on art and design and located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States.  History  The college was founded in 1882 as the Western Reserve School of Design for Women, at first attended by one teacher and one pupil in the sitting room of its founder, Sarah Kimball. The school moved several times, first to the attic of the Old Cleveland City Hall, then to the Old Kelly homestead on Wilson Avenue now East 55th Street. Having become a co-educational school, it was renamed the Cleveland School of Art in 1892. After unsuccessful attempts to merge the school with Western Reserve University, the school became independent. In the fall of 1905, the first classes were held in a newly constructed building at the corner of Magnolia Drive and Juniper Road in Clevelands University Circle. Beginning in 1917, the school offered classes for children and adults on weekends and in the summer. The school participated in the WPA Federal Art Project during the Great Depression 1930s. Medical drawing and mapmaking were added to the curriculum during World War II 19391945. The school began offering a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1947 and it officially became the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1949. The college gradually incorporated more academic courses into the curriculum, while retaining its key objective to offer practical training. In 1956 the school moved to a new building at 11141 East Boulevard that it would name for George Gund II, who served as the colleges board president and generous patron from 1942 to 1966. In 1981, the college acquired the former Albert Kahn-designed Euclid Avenue assembly plant which was built by Ford in 1914-1915 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Cleveland Institute of Art named the building the Joseph McCullough Center For Visual Arts following remodeling. In early 2013, CIA announced it would sell its East Boulevard building to the Cleveland Museum of Art and Case Western Reserve University. In 2015, the college unified its operations at the Euclid Avenue site, where it completed construction of an 80,000-square-foot building adjoined to the McCullough Center on the west, and also named for George Gund II. This new George Gund Building has been designed to look crisp and contemporary without detracting from the historic McCullough building next door. It houses: the Peter B. Lewis Theater, the new home of CIAs year-round, nationally acclaimed Cinematheque film program the Reinberger Gallery for public exhibitions; CIAs programs in Animation, Ceramics, Drawing, Game Design, Glass, Graphic Design, Illustration, Industrial Design, Interior Architecture, Jewelry  Metals, Life Sciences Illustration, Painting, Photography  Video, Printmaking, and Sculpture  Expanded Media the American Greetings Welcome Center the Admissions and Financial Aid offices administrative operations This campus unification fully connects CIA to the new Uptown development of retail, restaurants, and residential construction anchored by CIA to the east and the new home of the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland to the west. Uptown Phase II, at the corner of Euclid Avenue and Ford Drive, includes CIAs new freshman residence hall that opened in August 2014.  Academics  The institute offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts in many majors as well as study abroad programs, mobility programs, and internships. Services for students include Career Services and Center for Writing and Learning Support. Other academic programs include: Continuing Education Pre-College Programs Summer Workshops Young Artist Programs  Accreditation  The school is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools NCA and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design NASAD.  Rankings  In 2020, Cleveland Institute of Art was named a Best Midwestern College by the Princeton Review. In 2015, CIA was the only college of art and design to achieve this designation. Princeton Review is an education services company widely known for its test preparation programs and college and graduate school guides. In 201819, Money magazine named Cleveland Institute of Art to its Best Colleges for your Money ranking.  Facilities  Cleveland Cinematheque, a nationally recognized alternative film theater, is part of Cleveland Institute of Art. The recently completed 2015 George Gund Building adjoins the historic Joseph McCullough Center for the Visual Arts at 11610 Euclid Avenue. Reinberger Gallery presents free rotating art exhibits, events and lectures. Visiting artists often present lectures and symposia. The gallery is closed on Sundays. CIAs Uptown Residence Hall houses some 130 first-year students in the Uptown Development on Euclid Avenue.

    "text": "Reginald Smyth 10 July 1917  13 June 1998 was a British cartoonist who created the popular, long-running Andy Capp comic strip.  Early life and military service  He was born in Hartlepool, County Durham, England, the son of Richard Oliver Smyth, a shipyard worker, and his wife, Florence, née Pearce, the oldest of five children his siblings being Lily, Harry, Laura and Jimmy. With his father chronically unemployed, he grew up in poverty, and often referred to himself as a canvas shoes kid. He attended Galleys Field School on the Hartlepool Headland but left at fourteen to take a job as a butchers errand boy. In 1936, after a period of unemployment, he joined the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and was posted to Egypt. His father died during his service. He served during the Second World War in the North African Campaign, and was assigned to a tank demolition team. Promoted to sergeant, he was demoted to corporal for a minor disciplinary offence, and was ultimately medically discharged for a stomach ulcer after a stint in an Edinburgh hospital in 1945. He was awarded the 1939-1945 Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal 1939-1945, for his service. During this time he developed his talent for drawing, designing posters for amateur dramatic productions and selling cartoons to Cairo magazines.  Early cartooning career  After the army, he took a job as a telephone clerk for the General Post Office in London. He married Vera Toyne in 1949; they had no children. He continued to design theatrical posters in his spare time, and was advised to become a professional cartoonist. He sent thirty cartoons to an agent, who sold two to Everybodys Weekly for more than his weekly wage at the GPO. While retaining his day job, he was soon drawing sixty cartoons a week, using Reg Smythe as his professional name. The cartoonist Leslie Harding alias Styx worked for the same agent, and became his mentor. He contributed to publications like the Fishtraders Gazette and the Drapers Record, and drew sketches of council meetings for local newspapers. In 1950 he went freelance, and drew cartoon features like Smythes Speedway World for Speedway World and Skid Sprocket for Monthly Speedway World, as well as cartoons for the London Evening Standard, Reveille, Punch, and the Daily Mirror, where he contributed to the papers Laughter Column.  The Daily Mirror and Andy Capp  In 1954 the Daily Mirrors art editor, Philip Zec, gave Smythe a regular daily cartoon, Laughter at Work. Then, in 1957, he was asked by Mirror editor Hugh Cudlipp to create a cartoon character for the papers Manchester edition. He thought up Andy Capp, a stereotypically lazy, selfish working-class northerner in a flat cap, and his long-suffering wife Flo named after Smythes mother, during the seven-hour drive from his mothers house in Hartlepool to London. Capp is thought to have been based on Smythes father, although Smythe never confirmed that, perhaps because in one early cartoon he depicted Andy as a wife-beater, something he later regretted. Smythes mother recognised her late husband in Andy, although she insisted Richard was not a violent man. Capps headgear was inspired by a fellow spectator at a football match Smythe had attended when young, who took off his cap when it started to rain, because he didnt want to wear a wet cap at home that evening. Originally commissioned for the Mirrors northern edition, Andy Capp was soon appearing in all editions nationwide. The first collection of Andy Capp cartoons was published in 1958. The strip became internationally popular, appearing in at least 700 newspapers in 34 countries, including the Chicago Sun-Times in the USA. While in America the title became Andy Capp - Our English Cousin, the punning resisted translation: in Sweden it was titled Tuffa Viktor, in Germany Willi Wacker, in Austria Charlie Kappl, in Italy Carlo e Alice instead of Andy and Flo when published by La Settimana Enigmistica from 1960 to 2008. Later it was renamed Andy Capp when published in Eureka magazine from 1967 to 1984, in The Netherlands Jan met de Pet, in France André Chapeau, in Turkey Güngörmez Dursun, in Iceland Siggi sixpensari and in Denmark Kasket Karl. Later he was called Linke Loetje when published in the Volkskrant newspaper. In 1982 an Andy Capp musical was produced, starring Tom Courtenay with music by Alan Price, first in Manchester, later in London, and then to great success in Finland. A TV series aired on ITV in 1988, written by Keith Waterhouse and starring James Bolam, but ratings were poor and a second series was cancelled.  Later life  Smythe returned to his hometown of Hartlepool in 1976, living a reclusive life on a large estate. His first wife, Vera, died in 1997, and in 1998 he married Jean Marie Glynn Barry, but later the same year he died of lung cancer. He had left a stockpile of more than a years worth of Andy C",

    "text": "Huey Tum Ajnabi lit. You Turned Stranger is a 2023 Pakistani historical romantic drama film, written and directed by Kamran Shahid in his debut. Set during the events of the Fall of Dhaka, the story revolves around two lovers played by Mikaal Zulfiqar and Sadia Khan. After two years of development since 2014, three years of filming, and then post-production phase and further delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, the film was released on Eid al-Fitr, 22 April 2023, by Shahid Films and Mandviwalla Entertainment.  Premise  BBC Urdu quoted the director saying that the film revolves around two lovers, Zeenat and Nizam, who meet in Dhaka University when there is a war happening in former East Pakistan during 1970s. They have to face the fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists, and choose one among the love or the nation.  Cast   Production   Development  Kamran Shahid, a journalist by profession, revealed that after he was inspired with the book Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War by Sarmila Bose, he began writing the script in 2014. After two years of pre-production, he took self-responsibility to direct the film as well, marking his debut in this field despite being a novice. The director called its genres to be romantic movie more than a political one, based on before and after the 1971 war, so he characterized only three political figures in the film; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and Indira Gandhi.  Casting and filming  In November 2016, Dawn Images reported that Sadia Khan and Mikaal Zulfiqar have signed for the lead roles in a film split between East and West Pakistan. Other actors involved were named to be Alyy Khan and Shamoon Abbasi. The project was under the working title The Trial and initially intended to be released in March 2017. An earlier report in March had also suggested the involvement of actress Resham. Later, in November 2018, Vogue India reported Ayesha Omar being a part of this film as well. Principal photography started in late-2016 and took place in Karachi and Lahore. Though the film was self-financed, they received logistical supports by the Inter-Services Public Relations as well.  Post-production  After being wrapped up, the film went into the post-production phase in 2019. They had another intention of releasing it either on the festive holiday in 2020, or at the fiftieth anniversary of the Fall of Dhaka in 2021. But the plans ware scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and closure of the nationwide cinemas. Ishtiaq Ahmed served as the cinematographer, Sreejesh Nair as the sound designer, Scott Newman as the VFX artist, Rizwan AQ as the film editor, Baqir Abbas as the film score composer, and the directors father Shahid Hameed as the film producer. The musical instruments, color grading techniques, and wardrobe stylings were also inspired from that era to depict the proper period.  Soundtrack  Reportedly, the film soundtrack consists of 11 songs by various artists.

    "text": "Paul Leighton Johnson January 11, 1971  August 4, 2021 was an American house disc jockey and record producer. He was known for his self-taught DJ style of house music, mentoring and inspiring younger producers, and for a series of singles, including his 1999 worldwide hit single Get Get Down.  Musical career  Johnson first began DJing in Chicago in 1984 when he was 13, throwing his first party at his eighth grade graduation. He started working as a producer in 1987, doing tracks for Chicago house labels Dance Mania, Relief, Cajual, Nite Life, Undaground Therapy, Defected, DJax Up Beats, Peacefrog, and Moody. His song Get Get Down, while not a critical hit, was a commercial success, peaking within the top ten of the charts in Belgium Wallonia, France, Greece, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in December 1999. In 1997, Johnson and his partner Radek started the Chicago house label Dust Traxx, and had worked with Robert Armani under the name Traxmen and with Gant Garrard as Brother 2 Brother. His 2004 track, Follow This Beat, hit No. 8 on the US Dance chart. Johnsons productions had a particular distinctive soundhis tracks stood outthey were as tuneful as they were pummeling, reckless battering rams that made you want to sing along even as they bowled you over. As described by one journalist, Paul Johnsons signature meld of disco loops, overdriven kicks and unfiltered sleaze was nothing short of alchemy. Even when chopping up the vocals of Leroy Burgess or Roy Ayers, Johnsons records simmered with raucous charisma. Paul Johnson is the first name mentioned in the Daft Punk song Teachers, a tribute to several of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalters house music influences. The three became friends in 1995, with the French duo personally telling Johnson that he was one of the reasons they started to make house, something Johnson described as pretty damn touching.  Personal life and death  In 1987, Johnson was injured by a stray bullet and paralyzed from the waist down. After further health complications and a motor vehicle accident, he had one leg amputated in 2003, and the other in 2010. Johnson spoke about the difficulty of managing his chronic health conditions while being an active DJ and producer. Johnson was known for a big personality, ribald sense of humor, mischievousness and having stories for days. In his later life he was noted for his active and unfiltered social media presence. In 2021, he spoke about the lack of representation and opportunity for black producers in clubs and the house music community. In mid-2021, Johnson contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized in Evergreen Park, Illinois. After an extended illness, he died on August 4, 2021, at the age of 50.

    "text": "The Save the Greenback Act was legislation proposed, but not passed, in the United States Congress in 1995 and 1997 forbidding the phase-out of the United States one-dollar bill. It stated simply, Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the number of Federal reserve notes in the denomination of 1 which are in circulation at any time does not decrease below the number of such reserve notes in circulation as of the date of the enactment of this Act. In a February 24, 1995 speech introducing the Save the Greenback Act, Rep. Thomas M. Davis gave several arguments against phasing out the one-dollar bill: A great number of peoples pockets will be weighted down with heavy change instead of having a few bills tucked into their billfolds . . . one might suspect a conspiracy by clothing manufacturers in drafting the dollar coin proposal, as everyones pockets begin to wear out. Several polls have shown that Americans prefer the one-dollar bill to a dollar coin. Legislation designed to eliminate the dollar bill will an excuse by the special interests to raise prices on everyday items--a future sales tax, to be levied on all Americans but falling the hardest on those who can least afford it. The failure of the Susan B. Anthony dollar demonstrated that introduction of a dollar coin does not save the federal government money. The costs of changing to a 1 dollar coin would be significant to many in the private sector including but not limited to the small town banks which would have to retool their coin counting, wrapping and sorting equipment--costs which would inevitably be passed on to their customers. Notwithstanding these arguments, many people contend that 1 is far too low a denomination for a paper note at todays price levels and point to the example of virtually every other developed country, whose lowest-denomination banknotes are worth several times more. Most vending machines, for example, need to install dollar bill readers because their commodities have become more expensive due to inflation, a problem compounded by the bills often being crumpled, torn, or otherwise unreadable. Furthermore, the continuation of the dollar bill discourages any meaningful reform of the coinage, as people would be slow to use any dollar coin with the dollar bill still around simply out of habit, as proven with the Sacagawea dollar. Lastly, other countries, including the entire Eurozone, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, have successfully made similar transitions. For comparison, here are the lowest-denomination banknotes of some other developed countries with equivalent U.S. dollar value in exchange, as of August 23, 2015: In contrast, poorer countries with weaker currencies, such as Argentina or Ukraine, often have low-valued bills because of inflation having eroded their value.

The Alcan Land Port of Entry LPOE on the Alaska Highway manages entry into the US, while the Beaver Creek Port of Entry just outside of Beaver Creek, Yukon, manages entry into Canada. The current buildings of the Alcan LPOE and Beaver Creek Point of Entry were opened in 1972 and 1983, respectively.  Location and operations  The AlcanBeaver Creek Border Crossing is serviced by the Alcan LPOE on the US side of the border and the Beaver Creek Point of Entry on the Canadian side. The Alcan LPOE is located in a remote area on the Alaska Highway, surrounded mostly by undisturbed forest, wetlands and tundra. It is the only port of entry between interior Alaska and Yukon that offers year-round, 24-hour service for both personal and commercial traffic.  History  Until 1971, the US operated its AlaskaYukon border station at Tok, Alaska, nearly 145 kilometres 90 mi away from the border. This station inspected traffic entering the US on both the Alaska Highway and the Top of the World Highway. Between 1971 and 1972, US border inspection stations were constructed near the border both at Alcan and at the Poker CreekLittle Gold Creek Border Crossing. The Alcan LPOE was opened in 1972. Meanwhile in Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency had begun border inspection services after World War II, at a repurposed army building on mile 1206, north of Beaver Creek. The architects Pete Eikland and Billy Blair constructed a new customs building for Canada on mile 1220.5 sometime before the 1950s, but services were moved once again in 1958 to a new building in the middle of Beaver Creek. Due to its location and design, many tourists mistook the customs building for a gas station or food stand and drove past it. Canadian customs officers often chased after vehicles with a flashing light and siren to alert motorists before they left Beaver Creek. After years of petitioning by locals, customs services were moved once again in 1983 to a new steel building located past the Beaver Creek Airstrip, avoiding confusion. It is situated at 622431N 1405134W, 28.6 kilometres 17.8 mi away from the actual border, the furthest from the border crossing of any Canadian border station.

    "text": "A cornicello Italian pronunciation: korniˈtʃɛllo, cornetto Italian for little horn  hornlet; korˈnetto, corno Italian for horn, or corno portafortuna Italian for horn that brings luck is an Italian amulet or talisman worn to protect against the evil eye or malocchio maˈlɔkkjo in Italian and bad luck in general, and, historically, to promote fertility and virility. In Neapolitan, it is called curniciello or variants thereof. The amulet is also sometimes referred to as the Italian horn.  Origins and styles  A cornicello is a twisted horn-shaped charm often made of gold, silver, plastic, bone, terracotta, or red coral. Cornicelli are thought to be modeled after an eland horn, to represent fertility, virility, and strength. The shape and colour of the red cornicelli are reminiscent of a chili pepper. The evil eye is believed to harm nursing mothers and their babies, bearing fruit trees, milking animals, and the sperm of menthe forces of generation. In addition to being worn as jewelry, cornicelli are sometimes hung from the rearview mirrors of cars based on the older custom of using them to protect draft horses, and in houses. The cornicello is also linked to Greek and Roman mythology. The cornucopia became a symbol of fertility and the earth after Zeus broke a horn from a goat. He filled it with fruit and flowers and gave it to his caretaker. The coral of which it is often made is sacred to Venus, goddess of love, fertility, sex, and prosperity. Silver, of which it is also often made, is sacred to Luna, goddess of the moon. The phallic shape and red color is also a reference to Priapus, a male fertility god. A regionally popular amulet, they are most often worn by Italian men in Southern Italy, and especially in the region of Campania, as well as Lazio, Apulia, Basilicata and to a lesser extent in Sicily and Calabria. It can also be found among descendants of Italian immigrants in other countries.  Related  Possibly related to the corno is the mano cornuta or horned hand.

    "text": "Compound empowerment refers to the way in which public infrastructure is used to radically increase the accumulation of private wealth. The term denotes how commonwealthtax-supported resources, such as public education, financial and legal infrastructure, are translated into private or corporate profit. While wealth might be generated in part by intangible or personal qualities such as intelligence or a strong work ethic, this wealth is compounded by empowering structures such as access to stable markets, consistent law enforcement, and the use of resources held in common, such as public roads. The greater the wealth of an individual or corporation, the more they use commonwealth to increase and sustain their earnings.  Private wealth and common wealth  The concept of compound empowerment stresses the degree to which the acquisition of great private wealth depends upon common structures. For example, while a wealthy individual such as Bill Gates might owe his status as the worlds richest man largely to his intelligence and innovation, his ability to earn and maintain his fortune was and is compounded by public resources held in common. According to theorists such as George Lakoff, the prominent cognitive linguist and founder of the non-partisan think tank the Rockridge Institute, Bill Gates built his company with many employees educated in public schools and universities. Tax-funded research helped develop computer science and the Internet. Trade laws negotiated and enforced by the government protect his ability to sell his products abroad. These are but a few of the ways in which Mr. Gates accumulation of wealth was empowered by the commonwealth and by taxation. The inextricability of private wealth and public resources was influentially formulated by the political philosopher John Rawls, who argued that wealth is arbitrary from a moral point of view, as those factors that enable the accumulation of wealth in society are largely contingentthat is, are the outcome of luck more than of morally relevant activity.  Compound empowerment and fair taxation  Compound empowerment has been evoked to justify progressive taxation and other policies that stress the fundamental fairness of taxing wealthy individuals and corporations in a manner commensurate with their earnings. Because private capital is compounded by infrastructural resources held in common, supporters of progressive taxation argue that rich individuals and businesses should be called upon to support the infrastructures that enable the acquisition and maintenance of their wealth. Since a poor individual uses compound empowerment to a far lesser degree than wealthy individuals, it follows that the former would pay a smaller portion of taxes than the latter. Advocates of tax cuts or other policies that mitigate the taxation of the wealthy tend to argue that progressive taxation punishes the rich for their superior performance in the market. The concept of compound empowerment, on the other hand, argues that having generated their wealth in part through public structures, fairness demands an equitable return to those structures through graduated taxation.

    "text": "Handheld Torch is the debut album by Melbourne band Tarmac Adam. It was released in 2003 and featured two former Crowded House members, bassist Nick Seymour and drummer Paul Hester. The album was produced by Seymour. The album began as a solo production by singer-songwriter Matt ODonnell, who took time off work as an occupational therapist to record some of a set of 25 songs he had written. He recruited guitarist Sean McVitty and drummer Hester, who in turn introduced ODonnell to Seymour. Seymour began producing the album and in mid-2002 returned with ODonnell to his Dublin base to work on vocals, where the set list was reduced to 10 songs. On their return to Melbourne, the project was joined by multi-instrumentalist Steve Paix and in January 2003 the album was mixed by US engineer Rob Feaster. The album was funded by ODonnell after approaches to record companies by Seymour for a recording deal were rebuffed. ODonnell explained: I got to a certain age where I was working as a public servant for long enough and thought Id like to make another record and make it in a certain way. I borrowed the money to do it. Seymour said: On this record when I started working with Matt and Sean, we had songs that were the basis of the record realised. I sent them out to all these AR guys and record company stiffs that I had known over the years and got absolutely no reply. I followed up with phone calls and theyd say they werent interested or werent signing anything. I realised that because of the digital age you make your own records in the back garden and do a lease deal. It is a real drag but thats what you have to do. You have to come up with the money yourself to get Pro-Tools and the good speakers for your spare room. It is part of the DJ culture but a lot of kids who dont have money dont get money thrown at them anymore. It means the ones coming up the ranks are predominantly middle-class to upper-class kids.

In youth he was hailed for his inventions and in 1940 won the Gold Medal of the Fascist Syndicate of Inventors. One of these inventions involved the automobile. Later in life he became known for his eccentric views and was included in The Big Book of Weirdos by Carl A Posey and Gahan Wilson.  Biography  Born in Rome into a wealthy family, Creti claims that, from an early age, he would see complex machines and diagrams in his dreams or while in a trance, which he would then reproduce when he regained consciousness and begin to patent. His father, a Kardecist spiritism, believes that his sons activity is attributable to other entities and therefore encourages his son to participate in séances until Marcello himself becomes convinced that he is a Mediumship. He immediately attracted the attention of newspapers which referred to him as Italys youngest inventor and Benito Mussolini himself, who received him and encouraged him. In 1947, he purchased the ruins of the Benedictine monastery of San Luca located in the municipality of Guarcino to establish the Centro Romano Esperimenti Tecnico Industriali C.R.E.T.I. Roman Center for Technical and Industrial Experiments, where, among other activities, he gave free lessons to underprivileged children. In the 1960s, he set aside, albeit not completely, his work as an inventor to devote himself to exploration, which was another of his great passions. He undertook numerous journeys; the most famous, which was followed by the production of a documentary, was to the North Pole. In the 1970s, his studies focused on Archaeology and Mineralogy. The large amount of material he found enabled him to open a permanent mining exhibition at the Marcello Creti Cultural Association in Sutri. He founded the Ergoniani group in Sutri, which aims to prepare supermen and superwomen thanks to Ergos, or the radiant energy that governs all scienceref. However, Creti subsequently abolished this name and everything related to it, continuing its activities as the Marcello Creti Cultural Association. He died in 2000 shortly after appearing on the Maurizio Costanzo Show.  References   External links  Marcello Creti site",

    "text": "Sir Dennis Charles White 30 July 1910  17 October 1983 was a British colonial administrator who served as the last British resident to Brunei from 1958 to 1959 and later became the countrys first British high commissioner, a position he held until his retirement in 1963. White navigated Brunei through a period of intense political upheaval, including the 1962 Brunei revolt. White struggled to balance British interests, the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien IIIs authority, and rising nationalist movements, often clashing with both the sultans advisors and Malayan leaders over the future of Brunei. His tenure was marked by his firm belief in Bruneis entry into Malaysia, his frustrations with the sultans resistance, and his eventual resignation, partly due to health concerns and British dissatisfaction with his handling of the crisis. After retiring from colonial service, he remained involved in Brunei affairs as the governments agent in the United Kingdom from 1967 to 1983.  Early life and education  Dennis Charles White was born on 30 July 1910 in Muswell Hill, London, to Stafford Charles White, a lieutenant in the Kings Liverpool Regiment who was killed during the First World War in 1917, and Beatrix E. White. He also had a brother, Stafford Radcliffe White, a lieut-commander who was killed aboard HMS Narwhal N45 during the Second World War in 1940. White was educated at Bradfield College.  Career   Early career  White began his career in June 1932 as a cadet in the service of Charles Vyner Brookes Raj of Sarawak and was promoted to district officer in 1938. During the Pacific War, he was held as a Japanese prisoner of war in Kuching from 1941 to 1945. In 1955, he was appointed senior resident minister in Her Majestys Overseas Civil Service and later served as acting British resident to Brunei between June and December 1956.  British Resident to Brunei  In July 1958, White succeeded John Orman Gilbert as British resident to Brunei. By 1957, Gilberts relationship with Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III had deteriorated as the latter sought greater autonomy, gradually diminishing the residents influence and asserting control over the British administrationa shift encouraged by the British through key constitutional amendments that inadvertently expanded his authority via the State Council. White observed these changes and noted that the sultans rising influence was reducing the actual power of the British administration. By the time White took office, the sultan was widely regarded as a modern and enlightened leader, with his popularity bolstered by the success of the first five-year National Development Plan. Significant progress had been made in infrastructure, including the construction of a trunk road and bridges, alongside advancements in social services, education, and healthcare. These developments greatly improved the quality of life in Brunei, particularly in education, where the expansion of secondary schools led to a surge in demand. Anthony Abell believed that Whites arrival would strengthen ties between the State Council and the British administration, and he specifically requested White to do everything in his power to woo the sultan from the influence of the schoolmasters Marsal Maun and Pengiran Muhammad Ali. White disagreed with Anthony Abells radical views, particularly regarding British authority over the police and other security matters, and instead proposed a more pragmatic approach that supported local legislation in managing security, which was ultimately incorporated into the final agreement. However, Abell felt betrayed by the British governments acceptance of the sultans demands, which largely disregarded his constitutional efforts. With the sultan prevailing in his final dispute with Abell, this marked a crucial moment in Bruneis constitutional development. Meanwhile, the Colonial Office advised White to reject a visit from Tun Abdul Razak, the deputy prime minister of Malaya, as Britain sought to avoid any appearance of endorsing a union between Malaya and Brunei. Similarly, Geofroy Tory, the British high commissioner in Malaya, was cautioned against visiting Brunei to prevent the perception that Britain supported closer ties between the two nations. Whites stance aligned with the broader British strategy of maintaining neutrality while monitoring Bruneis political trajectory. By continuing to have friendly ties with the sultan and his advisors and learning from past administration errors, White first won good ties in the community. However, behind the scenes, he presented a bleak assessment to the Colonial Office, believing the sultan was deliberately delaying constitutional reforms. White sympathised with the Partai Rakyat Brunei PRB, considering it Bruneis most democratic party, but privately distrusted the local nobles and radical nationalists. British diplomats, including Abell, grew frustrated during his term as they realised th",

    "text": "Life-Line was a Baptist missionary boat used to conduct ministry work in the Coos Bay region of southwestern Oregon, United States, from 1914 to 1923.  Construction  Life-Line was designed by George H. Hitchings and built at Coos Bay for Reverend G. L. Hall of the American Baptist Publication Society. The vessel was 40.0 feet 12.19 m long, propeller-driven, with a 24-horsepower gasoline engine.  Operations  Once complete, this little ship, under zealot Captain Lund, ran up and down the coast for the Baptist Missionary Society, saving the souls of erring seamen and longshoremen alike.  Sinking  On May 26, 1923, Life-Line was being taken north from Coos Bay to Kelso, Washington, under command of Captain Lund who was operating the vessel with a deckhand. Life-Line foundered off the coast, just south of Neahkahnie, and Captain Lund and the deckhand swam to shore. The vessel washed ashore and was later covered by the sand, where it was forgotten until 1949, when a bulldozer uncovered the wreck.  See also  Lifeline disambiguation  Notes",

    "text": "James Aikman Peter Cochrane, DSO, MC 12 May 1919  5 December 2015 was a Scottish soldier who was awarded the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order during the Second World War. He later had a career in book publishing and printing and wrote a well-received account of his war-time experiences.  Early life  James Aikman Cochrane was born in Glasgow on 12 May 1919, the only son of Margarita Cochrane and Major James Aikman Cochrane. Major Cochrane, who served with the Royal Scots Fusiliers and Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, won the Military Cross, and the Belgian Croix de Guerre avec Palme and Croix de Chevalier de lOrdre de Leopolde. Peter had a younger sister Marigold. His mother decided that he should be known as Peter to differentiate him from his father and a cousin. He spent his early years at his fathers posting in the Far East, and was later educated at Loretto School in Edinburgh. In 1938 he went up to Wadham College, Oxford University, where he read law but left to join the army before he could graduate.  Second World War  Cochrane was commissioned into the Queens Own Cameron Highlanders QOCH in February 1940 and joined the 2nd Battalion of the regiment in Egypt soon afterwards. On 22 October, during the start of the Western Desert Campaign, he and his men were ordered to test the strength of the enemy in a raid on an Italian position near Sidi Barrani. They found vehicles rather than the expected enemy fortifications, and destroying the vehicles, withdrew to base on board the last remaining one. Their interpreter was a Libyan prisoner conversant in Italian. As soon as they started their withdrawal, they were shelled and mortared by enemy positions with rifles. The Libyan driving the vehicle proceeded very slowly stuck in bottom gear, forcing them to abandon the lorry in a wadi. Cochrane ordered his men to disable the vehicle under heavy shelling and tracer rounds. On his return to Company HQ with his small group he was recommended for and received a Military Cross for coolness, resource and initiative under fire beyond praise in that action. In early 1941, the battalion, part of Brigadier Reginald Savorys 11th Indian Infantry Brigade of Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirses 4th Indian Infantry Division, was engaged in a push through Italian Eritrea to dislodge Mussolinis Italian forces from the country. They faced particularly stiff opposition during the advance on Keren, a strategic port located nearby on the Red Sea at Massawa. On 3 February 1941, Cochrane, still only a second lieutenant, commanded two platoons that succeeded in taking a piece of high ground, later known as Cameron Ridge, that was required to direct forward artillery fire. The Commanding Officer CO of the other platoon had been wounded near the start of the action. In what The Glasgow Herald described as a lone attack, Cochrane destroyed two Italian machine gun positions single-handedly with grenades, killing the 13 occupants. He then held the position against counter-attacks and bombardment by artillery and mortars until reinforcements arrived to capture the main peak. For a fortnight he remained in the theatre of war on the frontline with his men, encouraging and leading them under constant enemy fire. They dealt with the snipers and machine-gun posts before withdrawal. He was awarded an immediate Distinguished Service Order DSO, awarded in person by General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief C-in-C of Middle East Command. In March 1941, Cochrane was required to advance to higher ground behind Cameron Ridge. Under artillery and mortar fire, he reached the top with just three men, one of whom was immediately killed. All of the survivors were wounded by shell fire with Cochrane receiving injuries to his head, arm and both legs. He was captured and loaded onto a mule, falling off three times; and then taken to an Italian hospital in Asmara. The doctors brought the unwelcome news that he must choose amputation of both legs or surgery on the gangrenous parts. Without anaesthetic he had to undergo the terrible procedure. Asmara was liberated on 8 April when the 5th Indian Infantry Division took the city, unable to walk, he was again the object of a surgical operation, but this time by a British doctor. He was evacuated to Britain on a journey that took three months by ship. Later in August 1941, Cochrane, having regained the use of his legs, was sent on a lecture tour of 23 cities in the United States, which was then still neutral, with fellow officers Lieutenant Richard Miles of the Royal Navy RN and Flight Lieutenant David Scott-Malden of the Royal Air Force RAF. In Washington DC he met his wife-to-be, Louise Booth Morley of the International Student Service ISS who was organising the visit. The Russians and their delegation included a Ukrainian sniper working for the Soviet Red Army behind German lines, Comrade Lyudmila Pavlichenko, a heroine of Joseph",

    "text": "Prop Cycle is a 1996 arcade game developed and published by Namco.  Gameplay  Prop Cycle is a 3D flying simulator in which the player controls a human-powered aircraft to pop hot-air balloons in the city of Solitar to prevent the city from floating away permanently. The cycle is controlled by using pedals to spin the propeller and handlebars to steer left and right and change altitude.  Plot  The story takes place in a world destroyed by a war 200 years earlier. A hyperspace magnetic weapon called the Tesla Bomb was used in the war, destroying all civilization and completely changing the worlds terrain. The few who survived have abandoned high technology and live a simple but elegant life. The most advanced technology is the steam engine powered by a natural resource called fuel stones. Using improved steam engines with fuel stones, it is possible to fly an airplane. With the worlds terrain made up of steep canyons caused by the destruction from the previous war, personal flight technology is necessary for people to live without destroying nature. However flight technology has undergone a high degree of evolution with the new civilizations collection of knowledge and now its possible to fly freely with only human power. The flying machine is called the Lapperopter. After somebody inadvertently activates a piece of old technology hidden within a shrine, pieces of the protagonists hometown are ripped from the earth and sent flying into the sky. The resulting floating islands are referred to as Solitar, and it is theorised that as long as the machine is active the islands will continue to rise, endangering the trapped townspeople. While efforts are made to deactivate whatever machine is keeping the islands afloat, none are successful. Eventually, a letter from Solitar is received that explains the nature of the mechanism; the machine is powered by balls of energy floating among the islands. It is theorised that a Lapperopter pilot of sufficient skill could travel to Solitar and destroy these energy balls, which would deactivate the machine and save Solitars citizens. Therefore, a test is devised; the protagonist is tasked with flying their Lapperopter around the towns airspace, popping balloons imitating the Solitar machines energy balls. If the protagonist is able to pass three routes, they will be allowed a single chance to travel to Solitar and attempt to disable the machine. If successful, the machine is destroyed and the islands of Solitar fall back to earth in the same place they originally occupied; the protagonist is hailed as a hero by the townspeople.  Development and release  Prop Cycle was designed by Shigeki Toyama, an engineer for Namco that worked on games such as Xevious 1983, Final Lap 1987, and Point Blank 1994. Toyama was inspired to create Prop Cycle after he and another Namco employee finished production on a technical demo where the player rode in a human-powered plane and shot down enemies. The demo didnt use 3D polygons, but instead 2D sprites with scaling techniques that created the illusion of a 3D world. While Toyama didnt find the game itself interesting, he thought its sense of flight was intriguing and decided to turn the concept into a full game. He was also inspired by the Studio Ghibli film Kikis Delivery Service, which stars a young witch flying on a broomstick. Since Prop Cycle was being made as an arcade game, Toyama wanted the game to be highly interactive and have a reason to be exclusive to arcades. He also wanted the game to be unique and distinct from other arcade games, as he never enjoyed repeating already-existing ideas. Toyama worked to allow players to experience the thrill of flying and feeling the wind, and to make the game itself be more than simply defeating enemies. To get an idea of what Toyama was looking for, the development team went out for a day of hang gliding with a camera attached to the gliders wings. The team spent three to four months developing the flying aspect; programmer Naoyuki Koyama didnt understand what Toyama wanted to convey with riding the wind, so to demonstrate he attached a weight to an umbrella to give Koyama an idea of what he was trying to create. Toyama wanted Prop Cycle to have a proper storyline in addition to its unique game concept. Jokingly referring to his role as the projects movie director, Toyama designed the setting, plotline, and characters, and drew the artwork for the villages and level themes. An intentional design choice was that the player had to make it to the last stage in order to understand the story, a decision he has since come to regret. Toyama considered making a Sightseeing mode where players were able to fly anywhere they wanted under a time limit, however the limited development time caused the idea to be scrapped.  Reception  Game Machine claims that Prop Cycle was the second most popular arcade game of August 1996 in Japan. Next Generation state",

    "text": "Susanna Wilkerson Dickinson c. 1814  October 7, 1883 and her infant daughter, Angelina, were among the few American survivors of the 1836 Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. Her husband, Almaron Dickinson, and 185 other Texian defenders were killed by the Mexican Army.  Early life  Susanna was born c. 1814 in Williamson County, Tennessee, and apparently never learned to read or write. She married Almaron Dickinson on May 24, 1829, when she was 15 years old. After acquiring land along the San Marcos River, the couple became DeWitt Colonists two years later. The Dickinsons then constructed a blacksmith shop there and made investments in fellow colonist George Kimbells Gonzales hat business.  Texas Revolution  As the Mexican government increasingly abandoned its federalist structure in favor of a more centralized government, Almaron Dickinson became one of the early proponents of war. He would later join with other volunteers during the Battle of Gonzales, becoming one of the Old Gonzales 18 in the battle which launched the Texas Revolution on October 2, 1835. By the end of the year, the Texian army had driven all Mexican soldiers from the territory. Soon after, Susanna joined Almaron at the former Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar now San Antonio, Texas shortly after his assignment to the garrison there. The Dickinson family lived outside the Alamo, boarding with the Ruiz family. In early 1836, Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led troops into Texas, which arrived in San Antonio on February 23 and immediately besieged the Alamo. It did not even have food stocked inside the mission to withstand the siege. The men thus quickly herded cattle into it and scrounged for food in the recently abandoned houses outside. Susanna and Angelina were among the families of garrison members who were brought inside for safety. For the next twelve days, the Alamo lay under siege. Santa Anna planned an early morning assault for March 6. At 8:10 pm on March 5 the Mexican artillery ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had planned, the exhausted Texans soon fell into the first uninterrupted sleep many had had since the siege began. At 5:30 am Santa Anna gave the order to advance. As the Mexican soldiers began to yell and their buglers sounded, the Texan defenders awakened and rushed to their posts. Susanna, Angelina, and most other noncombatants gathered in the chapel sacristy for safety. She later mentioned that Davy Crockett stopped briefly to pray before taking his assigned position. The Mexican soldiers soon breached the Alamos outer walls. As previously planned, most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel. Almaron Dickinson briefly slipped from his post manning a cannon in the chapel to join Susanna in the sacristy. He yelled Great God, Sue, the Mexicans are inside our walls! If they spare you, save my child!, then kissed her and returned to his cannon. It took an hour for the Mexican army to secure complete control of the Alamo. Among the last Texians to die were the 11 men, including Almaron, manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. The entrance had been barricaded with sandbags, which the Texans were able to fire over. However, a shot from the Mexican 18-pounder cannon destroyed the barricade, and Mexican soldiers entered after an initial musket volley. Although Dickinsons crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers, they had no time to reload. Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza, Bonham, and the remaining Texians grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. If he had succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the chapel, killing Susanna and the other women and children hiding in it. As soldiers approached the sacristy, one of defender Anthony Wolfs sons stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders and was killed. Another Texan was still alive. Jacob Walker, the gunner from Nacogdoches who had remained by his cannon as part of Jim Bonhams and Capt. William Careys artillery company. After there were no more balls left to fire, plugged his cannon with scraps of cast iron and broken pieces of chain and fired at the Mexican soldiers. A Mexican officer trained a force of muskets on them and they became major targets. Jacob Walker, who had remained by his cannon until his wounds kept him from firing his cannon, leaped from the ramp, and dashed to the side of Mrs. Dickinson in one of the chapel side rooms. He had made his way to the side of Mrs. Dickinson, perhaps in hopes that she would be spared to carry messages to his family. During the siege he had often talked with her about his wife and four children. His cousin Asa was also at the Alamo. Asa Walker had come to Texas from T",

    "text": "Revolo is a plug-in parallel hybrid technology that can be retrofitted in both existing and new cars. This technology can also be used in buses and trucks. The technology was developed by KPIT Technologies and the product will be manufactured through a joint venture between Bharat Forge and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration. Pre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive Research Association of India ARAI, Pune have confirmed that the technology provides fuel efficiency improvements by over 40 percent and a reduction in greenhouse gas GHG emissions by over 30. The technology is to be marketed to OEMs and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships.  Background   Planning and concept  The idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008 when he was stuck in Mumbai traffic en route to Pune. KPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from CREST, the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research and a budget under US2 million to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand a sudden surge in power when brakes were applied. The research and development team studied the firing pattern of internal combustion engines and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient, and at the same time offers good performance. Revolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30 kmh in the third gear without straining the engine.  Latest developments  KPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved its durability, and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014. The company will test various vehicles, including passenger cars, with engine sizes between 800 ccs and 2,500 ccs. Production of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by the first half of 2012. The commercial production would begin in 201213.  Technology   Revolo technology details  The Revolo kit is similar to a retrofit compressed natural gas CNG kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package. The kit can be installed in both petrol and diesel vehicles within 46 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a joint venture that KPIT has formed with Bharat Forge. The Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 horsepower electric motor developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic motor controller, leadacid battery pack, mechanical assembly, and coupling, proprietary software for control algorithms of the motor and batteries, and battery management system. As a parallel hybrid, the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic power outlet. Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained.  Plug-in parallel hybrid conversion kit  The conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in the context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the fuel efficiency to twice as compared to existing solutions. Battery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adapted to work with various types of batteries such as leadacid batteries or Lithium-ion batteries. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, leadacid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours. Revolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts them to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations.  Pricing  Revolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the after-market hybrid car kits available in the United States which cost around US20,000. It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of Rs. 100,000.  References   External links  Revolo Website",

    "text": "The Battle of Hansan Island Korean: 한산도 대첩 and the following engagement at Angolpo took place on 15 August 1592. In two naval encounters, Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sins fleet managed to destroy roughly 100 Japanese ships and halted Japanese naval operations along the southern coast.  Background  Yi Ŏkki joined with Yi Sun-sin at Yeosu on 10 August, 1592 Gregorian Calendar. On 12 August, 1592 Gregorian Calendar they rendezvoused with Wŏn Kyun at Noryang, bringing their total fleet strength to 56 warships. At Dangpo, they received news of a Japanese fleet sailing west from Busan. Wakizaka Yasuharus fleet of 73 ships entered Gyeonnaeryang.  Battle  On 15 August 8th day of the 7th lunar month, Yi Sun-sins fleet encountered a Japanese scout vessel and gave chase but broke off after sighting a large fleet of Japanese warships in Gyonnaeryang Strait. Yi Sun-sin sent a small detachment forward to lure the Japanese fleet, and they took the bait, following them into open waters off Hansan Island. The Korean fleet assumed a U-shaped crane formation with large warships such as 2 turtle ships in the center and lighter ships on its wings. The two fleets engaged in battle and most of the Japanese ships were destroyed in the engagement, while Korean reported few losses on their side. The battle lasted throughout the day until the Koreans tired from chasing and returned to open sea. Fourteen Japanese ships that had not engaged in combat escaped, the rest were destroyed. Wakizaka Yasuharu managed to withdraw to Gimhae. News of the Japanese defeat reached Busan within hours and two Japanese commanders, Kuki Yoshitaka and Kato Yoshiaki, immediately set sail with 42 ships for the port of Angolpo, where they hoped to face the Korean fleet close to shore. Yi Sun-sin received news of their movements on 15 August and he advanced towards Angolpo to confront them. This time the Japanese were unwilling to follow the Koreans into open water and stayed onshore. They would not take the bait. In response, the Korean fleet moved forwards and bombarded the anchored Japanese fleet for hours until they retreated inland. Later the Japanese returned and escaped on small boats. Both Kuki and Kato survived the battle.  Aftermath  Wŏn Kyun was left behind to mop up Japanese soldiers marooned on a small isle, but fled after receiving a false report of a large Japanese fleet approaching. The Japanese managed to drift to shore using rafts made from the wreckage of their ships. On 23 August, Hideyoshi Toyotomi ordered naval commander Todo Takatora to reinforce operations in Korea and halted naval operations at Busan.  International recognition  George Alexander Ballard 18621948, a vice admiral of British Royal Navy, complimented Admiral Yis winning streaks by the Battle of Hansando highly: This was the great Korean admirals crowning exploit. In the short space of six weeks actually about 9 weeks, May 7, 1592  July 7, 1592 he had achieved a series of successes unsurpassed in the whole annals of maritime war, destroying the enemys battle fleets, cutting his Hideyoshis lines of communication, sweeping up his convoys, imperilling the situation of his victorious armies in the field, and bringing his ambitious schemes to utter ruin. Not even Nelson, Blake, or Jean Bart could have done more than this scarcely known representative of a small and cruelly oppressed nation; and it is to be regretted that his memory lingers nowhere outside his native land, for no impartial judge could deny him the right to be accounted among the born leaders of men. Historians Hulbert also admired the naval battle, evaluating it as follows. This is the Battle of Salamis in Joseon. This naval battle is the death sentence for Toyotomis invasion of Joseon.  In popular culture  The battle is depicted in the 2022 film Hansan: Rising Dragon directed by Kim Han-min. The Battle of Hansando is also portrayed in episode 74 of the TV drama series Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

    "text": "Cody Canada and The Departed also known as The Departed and Jeremy Plato and The Departed is an American rock band. The band was formed in 2011 by Cody Canada, the former lead vocalist and guitarist for Cross Canadian Ragweed after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada guitars and lead vocals, Jeremy Plato bass guitar and vocals, Peyton Glasco guitar and vocals, and Eric Hansen drums.  History   2010-2012: Formation and This Is Indian Land  After Oklahoma based southern rock band Cross Canadian Ragweed broke up in 2010, Cody Canada decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a Super Group. Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow Yukon, Oklahoma native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves The Departed as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as Cody Canada and The Departed namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview. The band released its first album in June 2011 titled This Is Indian Land through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The bands cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song Staring Down the Sun was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, The Ballad of Rosalie and Skyline Radio both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.  2012-2015: Adventūs  On August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, Adventūs Latin for arrival on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an alternative rock and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: Worth The Fight, Prayer For the Lonely and Flagpole.  2015-2018: HippieLovePunk  Line-Up Changes  In September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road. The band continued performing as a four-piece group. In 2014, the band finished a new album, HippieLovePunk. It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top Alternative Country Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week. The sound was, for the most part, still like the alt-rock sound of Adventūs. Cody Canada and The Departed, as the band was once again known, debuted a new line-up at The MusicFest in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on January 8, 2015. East Texas native Ross Smith replaced Littleton on keyboards and took up rhythm guitars, while Eric Hansen became the drummer in place of Doege. In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song All Nighter on HippieLovePunk at John T. Floores Country Store in Helotes, Texas. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for Micky and the Motorcars Mark McCoy, who had died in Idaho in 2012 while on vacation. The songs Inbetweener and Easy were released as singles. In early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect, honoring 1960s era country music with songs by Johnny Paycheck, Stonewall Jackson and Charlie Walker, among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. Reckless Kellys Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.  2018-present: 3, singles, and Cross Canadian Ragweed Reunion  In early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3-piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single Lipstick from their new album 3, that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. Mike McClure, who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweeds albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd",

    "text": "The Barbra Streisand Album is the debut album by American singer Barbra Streisand, released February 25, 1963, on Columbia Records, catalogue CL 2007 in mono and CS 8807 in stereo. It peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Top LPs, and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA. By 1966, the album had sold over one million copies worldwide. The album was nominated for five Grammys at the 1963 Grammy Awards and won Album of the Year, Best Female Vocal Performance and Best Album Cover. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2006.  Background  Columbia label president Goddard Lieberson initially resisted signing Streisand to a contract, finding her style too close to the cabaret singers he disliked and too far from the understated approach of Jo Stafford or Rosemary Clooney, who recorded for the label in the 1950s. Lieberson relented and agreed to sign her. Nearly three decades later Streisand said: The most important thing about that first contract  actually, the thing we held out for  was a unique clause giving me the right to choose my own material. It was the only thing I really cared about. I still received lots of pressure from the label to include some pop hits on my first album, but I held out for the songs that really meant something to me. Streisand exercised her creative control and chose the straightforward album title, rejecting Columbias choice of Sweet and Saucy Streisand. She once mentioned, I said What is the truth of it? Its the Barbra Streisand album. If you saw me on TV, you could just go to the record shop and ask for the Barbra Streisand album. Despite Liebersons initial reservations, Streisand went on to become one of Columbias most enduring artists. The album was originally conceived as a live recording, since Streisand had made a name for herself performing at New York City nightclubs such as the Bon Soir and the Blue Angel. Her producer Mike Berniker brought a crew to the Bon Soir to record Streisand accompanied by the nightclubs house musicians and her pianist, Peter Daniels. The live recordings were shelved in favor of studio recordings, although the photograph for the album cover was taken during the Bon Soir session. Some material from the Bon Soir sets would later appear on Streisands Just for the Record... retrospective box set in 1991; and, coinciding with the sixtieth anniversary of those sessions, the full recordings were released as Live at the Bon Soir in 2022.  Recording  Recording studio sessions took place January 2325, 1963, at Columbias Studio A in New York City with a budget of 18,000. Material was mostly chosen from Broadway standards, many of which were fairly obscure. Ill Tell the Man in the Street was originally performed by Dennis King in the 1938 production of I Married An Angel, and Whos Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? was taken from the 1933 Disney cartoon Three Little Pigs. Streisands rendition of the Disney song began with the quoting of the first 11 notes from the Cat Theme from Russian composer Serge Prokofievs Peter and the Wolf, which did result in a lawsuit against Columbia Records, from Prokofievs estates, which was settled out of court, with Prokofievs widow receiving half of the proceeds for the unapproved quote. The Disney song ended on a Spike Jones style of rhythm and slide whistles, heard at the end of the track, before the songs fade. Not one of Cole Porters well-known numbers, Come to the Supermarket in Old Peking appeared in a 1958 television special with music by Porter, while A Sleepin Bee came from the 1954 musical House of Flowers. Soon Its Gonna Rain and Much More were both introduced in the 1960 off-Broadway musical The Fantasticks, and the 1930 film Chasing Rainbows provided Happy Days Are Here Again. Cry Me A River was a signature song of singer Julie London, while A Taste of Honey was coincidentally recorded less than three weeks later by the Beatles for their 1963 debut album, Please Please Me. Happy Days Are Here Again was released as Columbia single 42631 with When the Sun Comes Out on the b-side, but it did not chart. Notwithstanding, at the 1964 Grammy Awards, The Barbra Streisand Album won awards in the categories of Album of the Year, Best Female Vocal Performance, and Best Album Cover - Other Than Classical, the latter presented to art director John Berg. The only song recorded but not included on this album was Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered which Streisand and Mike Berniker recorded on two separate dates including a later session on January 29. The song was included instead on Streisands The Third Album using a Peter Daniels arrangement. Streisand chose Century Expanded Italic, the typeface for the album sleeve of her debut album, which would also be used on 19 other Streisand album covers. The album made its digital debut on CD in 1987 and was re-released in a remastered CD edition on October 19, 1993.  Critical reception  AllM",

    "text": "Love You is a song by American country music artist Jack Ingram. It was written by Jay Knowles and Trent Summar. The song was released on June 5, 2006 as the second single from Ingrams album Live: Wherever You Are. It is one of the two studio tracks on the album, which is otherwise a live compilation album.  Content  The song is considered a kiss-off song. Its lyrics feature several phrases where the word fuck is replaced with the word love, most notably in the chorus Love you, love this town  Love this mother-lovin truck that keeps breakin lovin down. There are also more traditional replacements in the song, with dang damn, heck hell, and shoot shit appearing several times in the first verse.  Music video  The music video was directed by Shaun Silva and premiered in June 22, 2006. It shows Ingram performing in a bar, while his girlfriend is outside destroying a pickup truck, which she assumes is Jacks. She scratches love you in the paint of the hood with her car keys, uses a baseball bat to break the windows, and finally shoots out the tires with a shotgun. Jack then comes out of the bar at the end of the song, laughs at the vandalized truck, and then leaves in his own truck, parked several spaces away. The actual owner of the vandalized trucka large, muscular man in a leather vestcomes out of the bar and surveys the damage to his truck, just as the girl flees the scene. The video uses a longer version of the song, with an extended 1-minute outro. The music video reached number 1 on CMTs Top Twenty Countdown for the week of October 26, 2006.  Chart positions   Year-end charts   Other versions  The original studio version from Live: Wherever You Are is also included as an album cut on Ingrams 2007 album This Is It.

    "text": "Eden Frankfurt German: Eden Hochhaus also known as Tower 90 is a high-rise residential building in the Gallus district of Frankfurt, Germany. Built between 2018 and 2022, the tower stands at 96.5 m 317 ft with 29 floors and is the current 44th tallest building in Frankfurt.  History   Planning  The construction of the 98-meter-high residential building with 27 floors began with the groundbreaking ceremony on 29 May 2018, and was originally scheduled to be completed in 2021. The completion date has been postponed several times because the building has not been approved by the authorities. The first apartment keys were then handed over in June 2023. The high-rise was built on the former Bosch site next to Mainzer Landstrasse. The hotel high-rise The Spin, a residential complex of ABG Frankfurt Holding with 270 apartments and a station on the U5 subway line were built on the same 13,700 square meter plot. The client was the investor gsp Städtebau from Berlin, which built the project until the underground car park was completed. After that, the new owner Immobel took over the project development. A height of around 90 metres was originally planned. In addition, the number of planned condominiums was increased from 200 to 263, but these will be smaller than originally planned and will mostly have one to three rooms. There will also be three penthouses. In addition to a concierge service, there will be a fitness studio. Panoramic windows are planned for the rooms, and the building façade will be covered in greenery. The 420-space underground car park will also be available for the surrounding buildings. The construction site is part of the European Quarter. Nearby is the building complex with the Skyline Plaza shopping center and the Grand Tower residential high-rise, which was built by gsp Städtebau.  Architecture  Originally, Robert Bosch GmbH wanted to build an office tower on the site formerly used by the company Tenovis. In 2013, this plan was changed and a residential tower with a height of between 60 and 90 meters was to be built. Because no investor could be found, Robert Bosch GmbH sold the property in 2015 to ABG Frankfurt Holding, gsp Städtebau and a private investor. Plans were presented for the construction of a hotel tower with a maximum height of 115 meters and a residential tower with a height of around 90 meters. In addition, a block perimeter development with apartment buildings was to be built. Completion was planned for 2020 or 2021. At the beginning of 2016, a realization and ideas competition was announced, which was won in March 2016 by the architectural firms Jahn and Magnus Kaminiarz  Cie. The design envisaged a 90-meter-high residential tower Tower 90 and a block perimeter development on Europa-Allee. In 2018, the name Eden was announced. It is an allusion to the mythological Garden of Eden. In January 2019, the project developer gsp Städtebau announced that the project had been sold to the Belgian company Immobel.

    "text": "The Emirate of Bukhara was an Uzbek absolute monarchy in Central Asia that existed from 1785 to 1920 in what is now parts of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. It occupied the land between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, known formerly as Transoxiana. Its core territory was the fertile land along the lower Zarafshon river, and its urban centres were the ancient cities of Samarqand and the emirates capital, Bukhara. It was contemporaneous with the Khanate of Khiva to the west, in Khwarazm, and the Khanate of Kokand to the east, in Fergana. In 1920, it ceased to exist with the establishment of the Bukharan Peoples Soviet Republic. The Turco-Mongol tribe of Uzbeks known as Manghits were the rulers.  History  The Emirate of Bukhara was officially created in 1785, upon the assumption of rulership by the Manghit emir, Shah Murad. Shahmurad, formalized the familys dynastic rule Manghit dynasty, and the khanate became the Emirate of Bukhara. As one of the few states in Central Asia after the Mongol Empire not ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan besides the Timurids, it staked its legitimacy on Islamic principles rather than Genghisid blood, as the ruler took the Islamic title of Emir instead of Khan. In the 18th19th centuries, Khwarazm Khiva Khanate was ruled by the Uzbek dynasty of Kungrats. Over the course of the 18th century, the emirs had slowly gained effective control of the Khanate of Bukhara, from their position as ataliq; and by the 1740s, when the khanate was conquered by Nadir Shah of Persia, it was clear that the emirs held the real power. In 1747, after Nadir Shahs death, the ataliq Muhammad Rahim Bi murdered Abulfayz Khan and his son, ending the Janid dynasty. From then on the emirs allowed puppet khans to rule until, following the death of Abu l-Ghazi Khan, Shah Murad assumed the throne openly. Fitzroy Maclean recounts in Eastern Approaches how Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly were executed by Nasrullah Khan in the context of The Great Game, and how Joseph Wolff, known as the Eccentric Missionary, escaped their fate when he came looking for them in 1845. He was wearing his full canonical costume, which caused the Emir to burst out laughing, and Dr Wolff was eventually forced to leave Bokhara, greatly to the surprise of the populace, who were not accustomed to such clemency. In 1868, the emirate lost a war with Imperial Russia, which had aspirations of conquest in the region. Russia annexed much of the emirates territory, including the important city of Samarkand. In 1873, the remainder became a Russian protectorate, and was soon surrounded by the Governorate-General of Turkestan. The Russians forced the abolition of the Bukhara slave trade in 1873, though slavery itself was not formally abolished until 1885. Reformists within the Emirate had found the conservative emir, Mohammed Alim Khan, unwilling to loosen his grip on power, and had turned to the Russian Bolshevik revolutionaries for military assistance. The Red Army launched an unsuccessful assault in March 1920, and then a successful one in September of the same year. The Emirate of Bukhara was conquered by the Bolsheviks and replaced with the Bukharan Peoples Soviet Republic. Today, the territory of the defunct emirate lies mostly in Uzbekistan, with parts in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In the first half of the 19th century it had some influence in northern Afghanistan, as the emirs of the Chahar Wilayat Maimana, Sheberghan, Andkhui, Sar-i Pol nominally accepted Bukharan suzerainty.  Society   Population and religion  Population estimates for Bukhara in the 19th century vary throughout authors. According to the Russian diplomat and orientalist Nikolay Vladimirovich Khanykov, the population was between 2.02.5 million. Another author estimates the population to have been around 3 million in the early 20th century. The Hanafi school of Sunni Islam was the most dominant belief amongst Bukharans. Sufi brotherhoods were popular, particularly the many sects of the Naqshbandi Order Juybaris, Dahbidis, Ahraris. A large minority also followed the Twelver school of Shia Islam, mostly people from Iran who were slaves, former slaves, or their descendants. The eastern Pamir Mountains, under Bukharan rule from the late 19th century, were inhabited by followers of Ismailism. Bukharan Jews also lived in the emirate, mostly in Bukhara and Samarqand. There was also a small Hindu diaspora.  Ethnic groups and identity  The people of the Bukharan emirate were bilingual and often ethnically mixed. Sedentary and nomadic lifestyles sharply contrasted, reflecting the varied geography, which included deserts, steppes, mountains, urban centers, and oases. The phrase turk wa tājik Turk and Tajik expressed this separation by representing the two primary elements of the society. The first element was the tribal nomadic clans of Turkic and Turco-Mongol heritage Uzbek, Turkmen, Kaza",

The first known mention of football at the University of Minnesota was on October 30, 1878 in the Ariel, the student newspaper at the time. It said that Football has been the all-absorbing amusement for the past few weeks. However, in those days, the only games played were against other Minnesota students. Minnesotas first intercollegiate game which has its results recorded took place at the Kings Fair Ground on September 30, 1882, though some secondary sources may incorrectly give the location as the Minnesota State Fairgrounds and the date as September 29, 1882. It was scheduled to be a three team track meet with the University of Minnesota, Carleton College and Hamline University competing. The team from Carleton College was unable to attend, so the other two teams went on with the meet without them. Following the meet, the athletes from Hamline wanted to go home, but were talked into playing a game of football first. A.J. Baldwin, the team captain, was the first Minnesota player to score in an intercollegiate game, leading his team to a 40 victory. According to the Ariel, It is only fair to say that the Hamlines did not have their full strength and the University won by two goals in fifty-five minutes. This ended the day and the crowd dispersed well satisfied with the beginning which had been made in intercollegiate sports. The teams had a rematch a couple of weeks later which was won by Hamline.

    "text": "The 1935 Philadelphia mayoral election was the election of Samuel Davis Wilson.  Background  From the Civil War, Philadelphia politics had been dominated by a Republican Party political machine. However, the machines power waned in the 1920s and 1930s, following a series of corruption investigations and the Great Depression, which destroyed the popularity of the Republican Party nationwide and in urban centers in particular.  General election   Candidates  Jack Kelly, construction magnate and former Olympic rower Democratic Samuel Davis Wilson, Philadelphia city controller Republican  Campaign  Wilson was a strong candidate. He had strong persuasive abilities, being able to take opposing positions on a topic while still seeming sincere. For instance, Wilson, as a mayoral candidate, condemned out of control federal spending. However, once elected mayor, in 1936 he would later assist in guaranteeing that 40,000 of his constituents were on the Works Progress Administration payroll. Wilson was not completely loyal to the national Republican Party, as he had previously campaigned for Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. Wilson was prone to taking a bare-knuckle approach to political discourse, not straying from referring to his opponents by pejoratives as dirty rats and bare-faced liars. Having registered 179,000 new voters after the 1932 election cycle, Philadelphia Democrats hoped to finally take the mayoralty. Democrats believed they had recruited the ideal candidate with millionaire contractor and gold medal Olympian Jack Kelly. Kelly was an opponent of discrimination. He had, himself, been blocked from joining the upper echelons of Philadelphia Protestant society. Kelly reached out to Italians, Jews, and African Americans. He also made an effort to slightly diversify the down-ballot positions on the Democratic Partys ticket.  Results  The race proved to be the narrowest mayoral election that Philadelphia had seen in a long time. Despite Kellys efforts, 56 of black voters and half of Philadelphias ethnic Italian electorate supported Wilson.  References",

    "text": "Frederick J. Bacon 1871-1948 was a late 19th to mid 20th century performer and recording artist on the five string banjo. He was also an inventor and entrepreneur, educator, composer, and designer and manufacturer of banjos. At the height of his performance career he played the banjo nationally. Along with Fred Van Eps and Vess Ossman he was part of a group of banjoists labeled virtuoso in the newspapers. He founded the F.J Bacon Co., possibly as early as 1902, after having invented a new resonator for open-back banjos. It wasnt until 1908 that Bacon came up with Bacon Mfg.  Publishing Co. to sell his banjos and music compositions. During the Big Five tour Bacon became Bacon Mfg. Co in 1911 from Forestdale and incorporated Bacon Mfg. Co. in 1912 dissolved in 1915. In 1918 from New London he called himself Bacon Banjo Mfg. Co. around 1918, and formally the Bacon Banjo Co. Inc in 1920 with E.O Winship and wives. In 1922 his company gained business experience in David L. Day, formerly of Vega. Together they produced Bacon and Day banjos B.D. on the headstock, some of which have been considered worthy of display in museums, as showpieces of artistic impulse from the Jazz Age. Frederick and his wife Cassie were proponents of the classic banjo style of playing banjo, in which the strings are plucked with the fingers, without picks.  Musicianship  Across his career, Fred J. Bacon played a variety of musical styles on the five-string banjo and snare drum. His performances included his own compositions such as The Fascinator and The Conqueror march, classical compositions such as Minuette a lAntique by Paderewski, and arrangements of folk music or minstrel songs, including Massas in the Cold, Cold Ground. Known mainly as a banjo player, he also continued to bring his drum on stage throughout his career, doing drum solos, and in 1936 advertised as a teacher of banjo, guitar, drums and violin. Growing up in Connecticut, he took banjo lessons from Alfred A. Farland when he was 12-years old. Bacon began public performance at 16, in medicine shows, variety shows, and Wild West shows, playing the snare drum and swinging his banjo. His earliest acts included roles with Hornsbys Oats a stage show in Boston and with Broncho Johns Wild West Show as Nebraska Fred. A performance poster in Boston labeled him the Banjo Kid. Bacon began performing on his own, under his really name and teaching the banjo. He married Cassie Maria Bacon in 1890, and the two would travel the country and eventually perform together. By 1911, Bacon had learned to play in a duo style, playing two distinct airs at the same time. In 1918 Bacon was advertised for a concert representing the banjo before the American Guild of Banjoists, Mandolinists and Guitarists, alongside musicians such as concert Mandolinists Samuel Siegel mandolin and William Foden guitar. The trio performed together in concerts between 1904 and 1918. Besides his banjo, Bacon also continued to play his snare drum in concert as late as 1933. He played two solos, Battle Scene and Coming and Going of the Empire Express.  Bacon Banjo Company  Bacons performances became an opportunity to sell banjos as he gained name recognition across the country. By 1907 he was having banjos made for him by Vega to sell as his own. They were sold as far way as Los Angeles and New Jersey. While living in Hartford he started the F. J. Bacon and Company in 1902, with A. E. Squires and G. S. Masleu, selling musical instrument strings. Bacon banjo strings and Bacon violin strings, were sold in music stores in 1903. At the time, he also endorsed Fairbanks banjos in the music store advertisements. In the Cadenza magazine, 1910, he is picture holding a Fairbanks Whyte Laydie. Bacon experimented with musical instrument making. While visiting Brandon, Vermont in 1901 he sold his patent neverslip banjo bridge to W. H. Johnson of that town. Johnson had been making the bridges for the Bacon Banjo Bridge Company and invented machinery to automatically make them. That same year, he took out a patent on a tailpiece that allowed musicians to restring their instruments faster. In 1905, while still living in Hartford, Bacon applied for a patent for a new type of resonator for open-backed banjos. He was awarded the patent in June 1906, after he sold his Hartford house in April. Builders finished working on their house and barn in Forest Dale part of Brandon, Vermont in 1907. He moved into the home with his wife by 1907, calling it Stonehurst. In 1908 they bought a second, large place as an investment, that they intended to turn into a hotel. They began touring together as an act about 1910, having two Vermont homes for summer and winter. Bacon advertised his banjos in the July 1909 issue of Cadenza magazine, as the Bacon Mfg. and Pub. Co of Forestdale, Vermont. Although Bacon was contracting with Vega to make his early banjos, photos in a magazine article show th",

    "text": "Tartagal Spanish pronunciation: taɾtaˈɣal is a tropical city in northern Argentina, in the province of Salta. It is located in the northeast of the province, within the General José de San Martín Department, of which it is the capital. It is located in the Yungas jungle, at the foot of the sub-Andean mountain ranges to the west and the Salta plains to the east. This location gives it a wide variety of flora and fauna, and its territory is home to eight indigenous communities. It stands out for the large density of large trees in its streets and squares, such as mangoes, algarrobos and lapachos. It is one of the few places in the world where the green macaw is not extinct in the wild. Due to its economy, it is the third most important city in the province, after Orán. It stands out as a center for oil and gas extraction, and also has strong activity in the forestry and agricultural sectors. It is located 365 km from the provincial capital, Salta, 57 km from the border with Bolivia so it is considered a border city, 103 km from the border with Paraguay, and 1736 km from Buenos Aires. Tartagal is connected to the rest of the province and the country through National Route 34, National Route 86 and through the General Mosconi airport, although the latter does not receive commercial flights at present. Tartagal houses a regional headquarters of the National University of Salta and the Catholic University of Salta. It also has learning centers from the Siglo 21 and Blas Pascal universities.  History  Tartagal derives from the tártago plant Euphorbia lathyris, a kind of spurge. The area of modern Tartagal appears with this name in legal documents for the first time in 1853. At the time the area belonged to the Tarija Department, Bolivia. The foundation date of the town, however, is acknowledged as June 13, 1924; the municipality was created soon afterwards, and Tartagal attained city status only on September 22, 1949. The Argentine Army has the 17th Jungle Cazadores Company Compañía de Cazadores de Monte 17 based at Tartagal. At the beginning of the 20th century, important oil deposits were discovered which lead to the founding of Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales YPF. YPF was founded by Hipólito Yrigoyen in the 1922, and later privatized in 1992, was highly valued during the governmental terms of Juan Domingo Perón between the 40s and 50s. It was out-competing Standard Oil, in terms of production as well as in terms of social impact, since it ensured work, social security, education for the workers children and dozens of benefits that dignified the lives of workers, not counting the commercial flow that positively impacted the area. Petroleum was discovered here at the beginning of the 20th century. Since 1926 the state-owned oil company YPF employed or indirectly supported most of the local population. In 1992 the company was privatized becoming Repsol-YPF and 90 of its workers were fired, prompting violent social conflicts and, a few years later, the appearance of piquetero unemployed workers movements, similarly to what happened also in other oil-producing areas like Cutral-Co, Neuquén, and in the neighboring General Mosconi. On November 12, 1966, several sounding rockets were launched from Tartagal during a solar eclipse. On February 9, 2009, heavy rains caused the Tartagal River to break its banks and flood much of the city, resulting in 11 casualties.  Tourism   Social Composition  The social composition of Tartagal is characterized by its cultural diversity. There are seven aboriginal ethnic groups that reside in Tartagal: wichís or weenhayek, chiriguanos, chanés, quechuas, chorotes, chulupíes and Aymaras. Another important element of its social structure is the migratory component that is added to its population. Because of it is so close to Bolivia, a high percentage of its inhabitants are of Bolivian origin. Tartagal was the main destination of immigration of the peasant-livestock population of the east commonly known as Chaco that settled, like the Aboriginals, in neighborhoods surrounding the city. It also has important foreign communities including: Christian Levantines of Syrian-Lebanese origin, Greeks with a Cypriot branch, Irish people, Paraguayans and Spaniards.  Population  The last census, in the year 2010, the city of Tartagal had a population of 64,530 inhabitants, becoming the third most populated city of its province, surpassed only by the provincial capital and by San Ramón de la Nueva Orán.

    "text": "The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification PEFC is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization which promotes sustainable forest management through independent third-party certification. As of 2006, it was considered the certification system of choice for small forest owners in Europe. Its 48 endorsed national forest certification systems represent more than 280 million hectares 690106 acres of certified forests. This makes it the largest forest certification system in the world, covering about two-thirds of the globally certified forest area. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland.  History  The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification was created in 1999 by a group of European forest owners and managers, led by the Confederation of European Forest Owners CEPF, to meet the growing demand for certification, particularly in developing countries where the costs of certification could be prohibitive. The main goal of the organization, initially called the Pan-European Forest Certification Council, was to develop a certification system that was flexible and could be adapted to different forest types and management practices, while still meeting rigorous environmental, social, and economic standards. In 2000, PEFC made its first endorsements of the national standards used by Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Austria. In 2004 it endorsed its first non-European national standards, used by Australia and Chile. As a consequence PEFC changed its name from Pan European Forest Certification to Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes. In 2005 the forest surface certified against PEFC standards reached 100 million hectares after joining of Canada. In 2007 the forest surface certified against PEFC standards reached 200 million hectares. In 2009 the first tropical countries became members of PEFC: Gabon and Malaysia and as of 2015 40 national organizations were members of PEFC. In 2017 the forest surface certified against PEFC standards reached 300 million hectares and as of 2022 there were 55 national organizations members of PEFC. PEFCs certification standards are based on the principles of sustainable forest management, which include protecting biodiversity, ensuring the rights and welfare of forest workers and local communities, and promoting responsible forest management practices.  Sustainable forest management criteria  PEFC International is the only international forest certification scheme that bases its criteria on internationally accepted intergovernmental conventions and guidelines, thereby linking its sustainability benchmark criteria with existing governmental processes. This includes: Pan-European Criteria, Indicators and Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe ATOITTO Principles, criteria and indicators for the sustainable forest management of African natural tropical forests ATOITTO ITTO guidelines on sustainable forest management ITTO PEFC requires adherence to all eight core ILO conventions, even in countries which have not ratified them. These conventions are No 29: Forced Labour 1930 No 87: Freedom of Associations and Protection of the Right to Organise 1948 No 98: Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining 1949 No 100: Equal Remuneration 1951 No 105: Abolition of Forced Labour 1957 No 111: Discrimination Employment and Occupation 1958 No 138: Minimum Age for Admission to Employment 1973 No. 182: Worst Forms of Child Labour 1999  National forest certification systems  PEFC only recognizes forests certified to standards that have been reviewed and endorsed by PEFC. National forest certification systems that wish to be recognized by are required to set standards keeping with the requirements of ISOIEC Guide 59:1994 Code of good practice for standardization. National standards must be developed by so-called National Governing Bodies, and meet requirements for transparency, consultation and decision-making by consensus. These guidelines also outline processes for revising and amending standards, and provide those who utilise the standard with the security of future certainty.  Endorsements  All PEFC-endorsed standards have been subjected to public review during their development. National forest certification systems wanting to obtain PEFC endorsement are subject to an independent assessment to ensure that it meets the PEFC requirements for the standards development process, public review and forest management requirements. The consultants report is reviewed by an independent Panel of Experts and the PEFC Board, and if satisfactory, the new standard is approved by the PEFC members as a PEFC-endorsed standard. To ensure the independence of the certification bodies, they are not accredited by PEFC itself, but by a national accreditation agency. In line with its commitment to transparency, PEF",

She first appeared on screen as Lucy Collins in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside 19821983, before going on to win the 1997 Evening Standard Film Award for Best Actress for the Mike Leigh film Career Girls. Her other film appearances included Leighs Naked 1993, Before the Rain 1994, Breaking the Waves 1996, and From Hell 2001.  Early life  Cartlidge was born in London, to Derek, an English father and Bobbi, a German-Jewish refugee mother. She was educated at the Parliament Hill School for Girls in Camden.  Career  Cartlidges work in the Milcho Manchevski film Before the Rain 1994 and in No Mans Land 2001 made her well known in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkans. Her first leading role was playing Sophie in Mike Leighs Naked 1993. Cartlidge worked in two more Leigh films: in Career Girls 1997 she played one of the lead roles, Hannah, at the ages of both 20 and 30, and in Topsy Turvy 1999 she was a madam in a Paris brothel. She was due to play the lead role in Polish director Lech Majewskis 2004 film The Garden of Earthly Delightsthat of an art historian dying of cancerbut she left shortly before production began. Cartlidge won a role in 21 Grams but was replaced by Charlotte Gainsbourg due to her death. Cartlidge was also filming Dogville at the time of her death and was replaced by Patricia Clarkson.  Death and legacy  Cartlidge died at the age of 41 on 7 September 2002, of complications arising from pneumonia and septicaemia caused by a pheochromocytoma. The impact of Cartlidges sudden death saw the creation of the Katrin Cartlidge Foundation by the trustees Mike Leigh, Peter Gevisser, Simon McBurney, Chris Simon, and Cat Villiers. The patrons include Lars von Trier and Cartlidges sister Michelle. Established at the Sarajevo Film Festival, an annual bursary is awarded by an elected curator, chosen by the Foundation Trustees from a wide and eclectic number of Katrin Cartlidges friends and colleagues...to a new creative voice... While the new talent nominated each year will be a filmmaker, it is anticipated that the choices will be as varied and extraordinary as Katrins own choice of filmmakers and friends from across the arts. Mike Leigh wrote: She took to the improvisation and character work instantly, easily and with extraordinary commitment and imagination. Other than in the Royal Court Young Peoples Theatre, she had had no formal training, but you would never have guessed it. Drama Centre London turned her down, and that put her off. ... She often talked to me about a move into directing. I am in no doubt that we have lost not only one of our greatest actors but also one of the most interesting new directors of the future.

    "text": "Kaliaganj is a community development block that forms an administrative division in Raiganj subdivision of Uttar Dinajpur district in the Indian state of West Bengal.  History  Historically the western frontier of ancient Pundravardhana kingdom, bordering ancient Anga of Mahabharat fame, the Dinajpur area remained somewhat obscure in the major empires that held sway over the region and beyond till the rise of the Dinajpur Raj during the Mughal period. Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the British in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the Permanent Settlement in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas police stations and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 196061, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district. In 1992, West Dinajpur district was bifurcated and Uttar Dinajpur district was established.  Geography  Kaliaganj is located at 2538N 8819E. Uttar Dinajpur district has a flat topography and slopes gently from north to south. All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger Barind Tract. The soil is composed of different varieties of alluvium. The main rivers are: Nagar, Mahananda, Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati Srimati and Tangon. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during monsoon, overflow the banks. The Tangon river flows through the upper portion of western part of Kaliaganj CD Block. The Chhiramati river touches the south-eastern edge of the CD Block and the Gamari river touches the south-western edge of Kaliaganj CD Block. Approximately 206 km of the India-Bangladesh border is in Uttar Dinajpur district. It covers the eastern boundary of the district. On the western side Uttar Dinajpur district has 227 km boundary with Bihar. Kaliaganj CD Block is bounded by Pirganj Upazila in Thakurgaon District and Bochaganj Upazila in Dinajpur district, both in Bangladesh, on the north, Biral Upazila in Dinajpur District of Bangladesh on the east, Kushmandi CD Block, in Dakshin Dinajpur, and Itahar CD Block on the south and Raiganj and Hemtabad CD Blocks on the west. Kaliaganj CD Block has an area of 301.90 km2. It has 1 panchayat samiti, 8 gram panchayats, 148 gram sansads village councils, 192 mouzas and 191 inhabited villages. Kaliaganj police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Kaliaganj. Uttar Dinajpur district is one of the smaller districts in the state and stands 15th in terms of area 3,140.00 km2 in the state. Gram panchayats of Kaliaganj block panchayat samiti are: Anantapur, Baruna, Bhandar, Bochadanga, Dhankoil, Malgaon, Mostafanagar and Radhikapur.  Demographics   Population  As per the 2011 Census of India, Kaliaganj CD Block had a total population of 224,142, all of which were rural. There were 114,104 51 males and 109,038 49 females.

    "text": "Oldfieldthomasia is an extinct genus of notoungulate, probably related to the suborder Typotheria. It lived during the Middle Eocene, in what is today South America.  Description  This animal was approximately the size of a marmot, and probably superficially resembled a rodent. The 10 centimeters long skull was rather low and had an elongated muzzle; the orbits, of large dimension, were posteriorly opened and located in the posterior area of the skull. The zygomatic apophysis was rather slender. The posterior part of Oldfieldthomasia debilitata was closely studied by George Gaylord Simpson in 1936, through the realization of 55 very thin sections; the study highlighted numerous cranial characteristics, such as the relationships between the various cavities. The tympanic and hypotympanic cavities were not separated and were devoid of spongy tissue; the path of the pneumatic orifice can be followed between the epitympanic recess and the epitympanic sinus, filling free, and close to the size of tympanic cavity. The main sinuses of the veins and arteries were also visible : the carotid entered the tympanic cavity. As in all notoungulates, the cavity for the hyoid apophysis was quite large. The posterior jugular foramen and the median jugular foramen were notably external; the external portion of the first constituted the posterior carotid foramen. The mandible was long and thin. The teeth formed a continuous and progressive series, with a complete series of 22 low-crowned brachydont teeth, both in the maxilla and the mandible. The canines were incisor-shaped. The protocone and the hypocone were almost identical, with an oblique and elongated central dimple and a posterior dimple stopped by a sort of hook fused to the ectoloph. An anterior and a posterior cingulum were present; the molars had a mesostyle, while the premolars were triangular, with a fold on the metacone.  Classification  The genus Oldfieldthomasia was first described in 1901 by Florentino Ameghino, based on fossil remains found in terrains from the Middle Eocene of Argentina. Ameghino described several species, such as Oldfieldthomasia anfractuosa, O. debilitata, O. parvidens and O. traversa, but it may be possible that some of these forms represents intraspecific variations within a single species. Oldfieldthomasia is the eponymous genus of the family Oldfieldthomasiidae, a group of archaic notoungulates representative of the Eocene; this family, however, is considered paraphyletic by some researchers. Oldfieldthomasia may have been part of an early evolutionary radiation of the suborder Typotheria, a group of notoungulates who occupied during the Cenozoic various ecological niches comparable to those of rodents in other continents. Its closes relatives were Allalmeia, Colbertia and Dolichostylodon.  References and Bibliography  F. Ameghino. 1901.

    "text": "In quantum mechanics, a doublet is a composite quantum state of a system with an effective spin of  1  2 , such that there are two allowed values of the spin component,   1  2  and   1  2 . Quantum systems with two possible states are sometimes called two-level systems. Essentially all occurrences of doublets in nature arise from rotational symmetry. Spin  1  2  is associated with the fundamental representation of the Lie group SU2.  History and applications  The term doublet dates back to the early 19th century, when it was observed that certain spectral lines of an ionized, excited gas would split into two under the influence of a strong magnetic field, in an effect known as the anomalous Zeeman effect. Such spectral lines were observed not only in the laboratory, but also in astronomical spectroscopy observations, allowing astronomers to deduce the existence of, and measure the strength of magnetic fields around the Sun, stars and galaxies. Conversely, it was the observation of doublets in spectroscopy that allowed physicists to deduce that the electron had a spin, and that furthermore, the magnitude of the spin had to be  1  2 . See the history section of the article on spin physics for greater detail. Doublets continue to play an important role in physics. For example, the healthcare technology of magnetic resonance imaging is based on nuclear magnetic resonance. In this technology, a spectroscopic doublet occurs in a spin  1  2  atomic nucleus, whose doublet splitting is in the radio-frequency range. By applying both a magnetic field and carefully tuning a radio-frequency transmitter, the nuclear spins will flip and re-emit radiation, in an effect known as the Rabi cycle. The strength and frequency of the emitted radio waves allow the concentration of such nuclei to be measured. Another potential application is the use of doublets as the emitting layer in light-emitting diodes LEDs. These materials have the advantage of having 100 theoretical quantum efficiency based on spin statistics whereas singlet systems and triplet systems have significantly lower efficiencies or rely on noble metals, such as platinum and iridium, to emit light.

    "text": "On The Red Carpet OTRC is an American syndicated show which carries celebrity news, Hollywood events and features about celebrity style produced by ABC Owned Television Stations for KABC-TV and DisneyABC Domestic Television.  History  On the Red Carpet was originally launched in 2002 as an effort by KABC to brand their local coverage of the Academy Awards leading into the national coverage from ABC. They decided to continue the site and build the traffic. On March 14, 2010, the Sunday after the Academy Awards, On the Red Carpet was launched as a weekly series for KABC. Seven other ABC Owned Television Stations soon carried the show, with San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV San Diego also following. The show began to be carried by the national digital subchannel, the Live Well Network, also owned by AOTS, in the fall of 2010, with the addition of Chris Balish, as co-host. Balish left the show in 2012. The series produced their live Oscar special in 2012, which featured the college journalist winners of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencess Red Carpet Journalist Contest assisting in the interviews. The show moved from the Live Well Network to national syndication on September 14, 2013 with a return to a single host, mainly on ABC affiliates and usually airing on Saturday or Sunday afternoons against sports on other networks. On June 27, 2014, the OTRC.com website was shut down with the show using social media instead for content releases. The syndicated program ended production with their September 13, 2014 edition, but the On the Red Carpet banner will remain for KABCs Oscars coverage in the future. In recent years, OTRC has expanded to include coverage of other awards shows and film festivals.  Format  In its form, On The Red Carpet aired for half an hour every Sunday evening at 6:30 p.m. on KABC and is designed as a weekend slotted show with stations scheduling it in the access hour and late-fringe time-slots. The series was sold on an all-barter basis to stations with the ad split, 4 minutes local and three three-and-a-half minutes national per episode. It was hosted by Miss USA 2007 winner Rachel Smith and produced by KABC-TVs news department. The episodes are shot on location instead of in studio. The show is composed of celebrity news, exclusive set visits, first looks at upcoming film and television projects, and one-on-one interviews with Hollywood talents and celebrities.  References",

    "text": "Marie Louise Andrews née, Newland; October 31, 1849  February 7, 1891 was an American author and editor from Indiana. She was a founder of the Western Association of Writers, and served as its secretary from its founding until June 1888, when she retired. She was prolific in both verse and prose, but she never published her works in book form, and little of her work has been preserved.  Early life and education  Mary later Marie Louise Newland was born in Bedford, Indiana, on October 31, 1849. She was the second daughter of Dr. Benjamin Franklin Newland 18211889 and Louisa Ann Curry Newland, who were educated and considered to be intellectuals. Her early life was spent in Bedford, where she was mainly educated in private schools. She was a student at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, in St. Agnes Hall, Terre Haute, Indiana, and at Hungerford Collegiate Institute, Adams, New York, which was destroyed by fire shortly before commencement, so that Andrews was not formally graduated. Andrews spoke French and German, and was familiar with Latin and modern language literature.  Career  In the winter of 188586, while working as an editor at the Indianapolis Herald, Andrews and other contributors to the paper, including John C. Ochiltree, Dr. James Newton Matthews, Richard Lew Dawson, and Dr. Henry William Taylor, became the founders of the Western Association of Writers movement, discussing the idea of a writers association publicly through the Heralds columns. Andrews, a co-founder of the association, served as its secretary from its organization until June, 1888, when she retired from the office. Among her acquaintances were many of the prominent writers of the Western United States, and at the annual conventions of the association, she was always a conspicuous member. She was also remembered as a brilliant conversationalist and an effective impromptu speaker. The Western Association of Writers owed its organization and establishment largely to Andrews indefatigable efforts. Andrews was not an author in the technical sense of having written a book, yet she gained a well-merited reputation as a ready and versatile writer of poems, essays, and sketches, contributing to various periodical publications. Her interest in literary work was much broader than a purely personal matter. The development of western literature, and its recognition by the country and the world at large, had been on her mind for some time before she was given the opportunity to demonstrate the practicability of her ideas in the association with which her name was closely identified. She foresaw the growth of literature in the west, and her ideas regarding that growth and of the best means of fostering it were embodied in the association. It served as a means of introducing scores of talented writers to the public. She was one of the most active promoters of the organization in its inception, and was one of its most steadfast friends through the years when its continuance seemed questionable.  Personal life  On May 15, 1875, she married Albert M. Andrews, then of North Vernon, Indiana. Soon afterwards, they moved to Connersville, Indiana where he worked in the pharmaceutical business. She was in Indianapolis for several winters, supervising the education of her son, Albert Charlton Andrews, who was her only child. Marie Louise Andrews died at Connersville on February 7, 1891.

    "text": "The Oriental greenfinch Chloris sinica, also known as the grey-capped greenfinch, is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae that breeds in broadleaf and conifer woodlands of the East Palearctic.  Taxonomy  In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Oriental greenfinch in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in China. He used the French name Le pinçon de la Chine and the Latin Fringilla sinencis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the oriental greenfinch. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Fringilla sinica and cited Brissons work. The type locality was subsequently restricted to Macau in eastern China. The specific name sinica is Medieval Latin for Chinese. The greenfinches were later placed in the genus Carduelis but when molecular phylogenetic studies found that they were not closely related to the other species in Carduelis, the greenfinches were moved to the resurrected genus Chloris. The genus had been introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800. The word Chloris is from the Ancient Greek khlōris for a European greenfinch; the specific epithet sinica is Mediaeval Latin for Chinese. Five subspecies are now recognised: C. s. ussuriensis Hartert, 1903  Eastern Manchuria to South Ussuriland and Korea C. s. kawarahiba Temminck, 1836  Kamchatka Peninsula, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin and Hokkaido, KoreaUlleung Island, winters to Japan C. s. minor Temminck  Schlegel, 1848  South Japan Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu and Korea Cheju-Do Island C. s. sinica Linnaeus, 1766  Western China Gansu to South Manchuria C. s. chabarowi Stegmann, BK 1929  Inner Mongolia to North Manchuria The Bonin greenfinch from the Bonin Islands including Iwo Jima, formerly C. s. kittlitzi, is nowadays usually considered a distinct species.  Description  The Oriental greenfinch is a medium-sized finch 12.5 to 14 cm 4.9 to 5.5 in in length, with a strong bill and a short slightly forked tail. It nests in trees or bushes, laying 35 eggs.

History  The album was produced by Duke Ellington with financial support from Frank Sinatra. Powell played the tune Satin Doll by ear after Ellington sang it to him during the session. Alternates and outtakes from the session were released by Mythic Sound on Earl Bud Powell, Vol. 6: Writin for Duke, 63.  Reception  In a review for AllMusic, Ron Wynn noted Powells uneven but often astonishing piano work, and wrote: the vast majority of selections are performed with flair and conviction. Writer Ira Gitler commented: this album stands far above the painful Victors and Verves of the 19541956 period and is more like early Powell than the Blue Notes of the late fifties. A writer for Billboard stated that Powell plays smoothly and most brightly, and is capable of conveying the subtlest of jazz moods.

Holt 18071865 and Hannah White 17941892. He graduated from Gould Academy in Bethel. It is believed that Holt established a firm with contractors Moses C. Foster and Cyrus Buck, but had started out on his own by 1857, for he was advertising his services in the Bethel Courier. Buck died in the Civil War in 1865, aged 24 or 25, while fighting for the Union Army. In 1860, Holt designed the Central Parish Church in Yarmouth, Maine, which still stands on the towns Main Street, at the head of Portland Street, and is now on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of only four surviving examples of his work on churches in Maine. Between 1871 and 1876, he served as chief engineer of the Maine Central Railroad, for whom he designed bridges and buildings, in addition to undertaking surveys for potential new lines. In 1876, he moved to California, where he continued in architecture but also branched into mining and lumbering.

    "text": "South River is located in the community of South River in Ontario as a railway station. The station was originally constructed by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, a subsidiary of the Northern and Northwestern Railway, in 1884. It was subsequently owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway 1888 - 1919 and Canadian National Railways 1919 - 1986. It was a significant station stop along the historic route connecting Toronto to North Bay, and the Canadian Pacific Railway 1885. Transcontinental trains traveling between Toronto and Vancouver once frequented the station. It is likely the oldest wooden railway station in north-eastern Ontario. It is now a community heritage building in the town of South River.  History  The Northern Railway of Canada had reached Gravenhurst by 1875, which was its northernmost terminal at the time. The section between Barrie and Gravenhurst was initially built by the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway, circa 1870, before being acquired by the Northern Railway in 1875. The Northern and Northwestern railway network consisted of the former Northern Railway of Canada, and Hamilton and Northwestern Railway, which merged in 1879. Due to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Mattawa valley, and along the north shore of Lake Nipissing beginning in the summer of 1881, the Toronto-based Northern and Northwestern wished to provide a direct connection to the new C.P.R. transcontinental line that would ensure Torontos economic involvement. A new company was formed, the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway which was then leased to and operated by the parent Northern and Northwestern Railway, circa 1883. The new line was to extend the existing railhead at Gravenhurst to the C.P.R. mainline at the La Vase River, just east of Lake Nipissing. This location was subsequently named Nipissing Junction. The line was referred to as The Callander Extension at the time, as the village of Callander was the closest existing establishment to the junction point. Construction began in 1884 and was finished in 1886. Regular-schedule, revenue service commenced in the spring of 1887. One year later in 1888, the Grand Trunk Railway bought out the Northern and Northwestern Railway, including the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. From that time on, until the insolvency of the G.T.R. circa 1918-1919 the line was owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway. From that time until the present day, the line has been owned and operated by Canadian National Railways. The South River Station is one of the first generation, original wooden stations built by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. It is also the last surviving station originally built along the line, all of the others having been demolished or replaced. This ranks it among the oldest railway stations in northern Ontario, and likely the oldest wooden station still existing in the region. The South River station was built on the east side of the mainline and situated between Ottawa Avenue and Montreal Avenue. It featured a hip roof over the operators bay, and two gable dormers over the freightexpress section. It was later moved by the Grand Trunk to the west side of the mainline, opposite to its original location, likely around 1907-1908 Requires confirmation. At this time, a new operators bay was constructed and finished with a new gable roof to face the mainline. The freightexpress section was also altered with the addition of one shed-roof dormer, which was also added to face the mainline. The station featured a combination of painted wood siding finishes: tongue and groove infill along the base course, doors, and soffit; and board and batten in the mid and upper courses. The original roof was cedar shingle. Heating was provided by pot-belly stoves using wood andor coal. Initial interior and exterior platform lighting was provided by kerosene lanterns. While the original Northern and Pacific Junction Railway paint scheme is unknown, the standard Grand Trunk Railway paint scheme of hunter green, burgundy and yellow cream was used thereafter. Sometime in the post-war era after 1945 a gray asphalt siding product Insulbrick was applied by Canadian National Railways over the wall sections. Asphalt roll and shingles later replaced the initial use of cedar shingles. Consistent with the treatment of their historic railway stations, Canadian National Railways made numerous unsympathetic alterations to the building over the years, diminishing its original architectural elements and finishes. General neglect and lack of investment in these types of stations rendered most of them beyond repair, in which case they were demolished or left to decay. The community of South River, however, established a restoration group which has overseen a concerted effort to save and re-establish the original paint scheme and wood finishes of the structure. Restoration work on the station was undertaken in th",

The building is also called Bergkirche Mountain church for its prominent location. The chapel had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1687. It is a listed monument, where services are held in summer and for Christmas.  History  The chapel probably began as a cemetery chapel in the 11th or 12th century on a hill near Kaubenheim, because swampy grounds in the valley did not permit burials. The building is named after Michael the Archangel, who is considered to be the guardian of the Christian church. The chapel is documented first by Lutheran church records Kirchenbücher in 1533. In the present building, only interior features in the tower date back to the medieval chapel, which was damaged by fire caused by lightning on 21 March 1687. The building was restored from 1695 to 1702, with the nave completed in 1696. Interior features were installed until 1717. The pulpit was bought around 1699, probably from the parish in Ipsheim. Christoph Rösler created 18 paintings on canvas in 1701 and 1702. They depict Biblical topics and were installed at the balustrade of the balcony. A third bell was acquired with a donation from Martin Dennler, the school master, in 1745. At the same time, a new organ was built. The interior was remodelled in 1862. The chapel was equipped with electricity around 1980. The interior was restored between 1986 and 1988, and the exterior from 2014 to 2016. The building is a listed monument. Services are usually held from Easter to Kirchweihe in October, and for Christmas and New Years Eve.

    "text": "Macandrew Bay Māori: Te Roto Pāteke is located on the Otago Peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand. It is situated on the edge of Otago Harbour, and is named for pioneer Scottish settler James Macandrew who lived here during his later life. The Te Reo Māori name for the bay, Te Roto Pāteke, refers to the Brown teal Māori: Pāteke formerly prevalent in the area. Early European residents of the area called the bay The Hundreds, due to the large number of boulders which covered the foreshore. Macandrew Bay is a suburb of Dunedin, but has the feel of an isolated coastal settlement and is often regarded as a separate township, even though the heart of the city is visible 10 kilometres away at the head of the harbour. It is both a commuter and a harbourside retreat from the city. The settlement centres on an area around the junction of Portobello Road and Greenacres Street, the latter a narrow road which rises steeply towards the interior of the Peninsula. Greenacres Street roughly follows the valley of the small Rodgers Creek. The community hall lies on the lower part of Greenacres Street close to its junction with Portobello Road, and the settlements few shops lie immediately to the southwest of the junction. Behind these shops lie the communitys primary school and cemetery, the latter of which includes the grave of James Macandrew. The bay has a small beach opposite the shops, which is well-used by the public. The beach was created artificially, with sand brought to the bay from the nearby Pacific coast. The area around the beach has been turned into a small public park, and landscaping of this was completed in 1979. Macandrew Bay is the largest of several settlements which lie on the harbour coast of Otago Peninsula. Between it and Dunedin lies Glenfalloch, a private gardens open to the public. Beyond Macandrew Bay to the northeast lie Company Bay and Raynbirds Bay and to the southwest is Colinswood, the latter named for James Macandrews house. These small settlements could be considered suburbs of the Macandrew Bay. Beyond Raynbirds Bay lie Broad Bay and Portobello. These settlements are connected to each other and to Dunedins city centre by Portobello Road, a winding road which runs along the harbour coast of the peninsula, and by the Otago Harbour Cycleway, which runs alongside it Both the road and the sea wall which lies along the harbour edge were constructed by prison labour in the 1860s. A second route, Castlewood Road, rises from Company Bay to meet with Highcliff Road, which runs along the ridge of the peninsula from Dunedin to Portobello.

    "text": "Louis Ortiz also known as Bronx Obama is an American impressionist of Barack Obama. A former field technician for Verizon, Ortiz is the subject of Bronx Obama, a Kickstarter-financed documentary produced and directed by Ryan Murdock. He also played several background characters in the Star Trek franchise, notably Ensign Culhane in Star Trek Voyager; he also has one credited appearance in Star Trek as a Klingon warrior.  Career beginnings  In August 2008, Ortiz was unemployed, collecting workers compensation, and playing in pool tournaments for money. Friends jokingly told Ortiz that his picture was on the front page of the New York Daily News. When Ortiz looked at the newspaper he failed to see the resemblance. Ortiz went to play pool at the Williamsbridge Tavern in the Bronx when Pat, his friend and bartender, noted the similarity to Obama. Ortiz, who had facial hair, still couldnt picture the similarity. While many people commented to Ortiz about his likeness to Obama, Pat was the first to mention and encourage Ortiz to use the likeness as a financial opportunity. Ortiz, who was unemployed for a year and in desperate need of money, was intrigued by the possibilities. He shaved his facial hair, and was dumbfounded by the similarity. Pat, who had some experience in modeling, helped Ortiz develop a plan to capitalize on his likeness to the Democratic presidential nominee. Ortiz managed to gather enough money for head shots and a new suit. With the help from friends at the bar, he contacted agents and sent resumes and head shots. He practiced his impersonation in the mirror for several weeks then decided it was time to make his first public appearance. September 21, 2008 was the date of the last game to be played at the old Yankee Stadium. Ortiz, costumed in his suit, ascended into the bleachers with several friends, many of whom were retired policemen who pretended they were escorting the actual Barack Obama. Ortiz said it wasnt long before he drew attention from the crowd and grabbed the attention of the audience.  Career highlights  Ortiz contracted with a talent agency, William Gold Entertainment, that has increased his status. He was also on an episode of This American Life. He had a New York Times feature and a segment on The Jeff Probst Show on the CBS television channel. He also appeared in the Japanese feature film Saraba Itoshi no Daitouryou Good Bye Dear President. He has done commercials for Netherland-based Rabobank, South Korean satellite television provider, Skylife, and appeared in a Times Square billboard campaign for the car manufacturer, Hyundai. Ortiz has been a guest star in myISHs The Hillywood Show, The Onion, MTVs Matts Apartment, Four Shaw Entertainments Tomorrow: The Film, and Australian web series, The Nobel Funk Off. Ortizs career as an Obama impersonator was the subject of the 2014 documentary film Bronx Obama by Ryan Murdock. The film was developed under the name The Audacity of Louis Ortiz; however, the film was re-titled before its release.  References",

    "text": "Bruce Wayne Campbell December 14, 1946  August 3, 1983, known by his stage name Jobriath, was an American rock musician and actor. He was the first openly gay rock musician to be signed to a major record label and one of the first internationally famous musicians to die of AIDS.  Biography   Early life and career  Born Bruce Wayne Campbell in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Jobriath showed early musical talent for playing the piano, and soon played organ in his local church. It was during this time his talents led him to being introduced to Eugene Ormandy as a child prodigy. While he was a high school student, he became further interested in classical music, and favored composers such as Sergei Prokofiev. He wrote the first two movements of his first symphony by his senior year in high school, but for reasons unknown chose not to complete it. After graduating from Upper Merion High School in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania in 1964, Jobriath took an interest in folk music, partly inspired by seeing Peter, Paul and Mary in concert several times. He briefly formed a folk group with the help of his music teacher who arranged for identical twins Marty and Grace to join him. As a trio they named themselves The Last Three, and played several regional shows in the PA area before Marty and Grace departed for college. While Jobriath attended Temple University for one semester in the music program, he soon dropped out. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in the mid-1960s and went AWOL within months. Renaming himself Jobriath Salisbury, he relocated to Los Angeles.  Casting in Hair and early recordings with Pidgeon  After accompanying a friend to the audition for the musical Hair as a piano player, he impressed the producer and director with his singing and talents on the piano. He was soon cast by the director Tom OHorgan into the leading role of Woof, a character implied to be gay. He appeared in the legendary West Coast production at the Aquarius Theater on Sunset Boulevard. Despite receiving positive reviews for his performances, he was fired from the production for upstaging the other actors. After leaving the production in 1969, he joined the folk-rock band Pidgeon, which was then signed to Decca Records, as their lead singer, pianist and guitarist. The band recorded a debut album originally titled First Flight From the Forest which was re-titled by their label as the self-titled Pidgeon, andshortly after the albums releasethe band released the single Rubber Bricks bw Prison Walls before disbanding. Both were produced by Stan Farber. At this time he was traced by the Military Police and arrested, spending nearly six months in a military psychiatric hospital after suffering a breakdown. During this period he began writing the songs that would lead to his next musical incarnation.  Jerry Brandt, the hype and Jobriath Boone  In mid-December 1972, Jerry Brandt, Carly Simons former manager, overheard a demo tape being played by Clive Davis at Columbia Records. Davis rejected the tape as mad, unstructured and destructive to melody, but Brandt was quick to step in. Jobriath later remarked that coming from a man who discovered both Patti Smith and Barry Manilow...so much for sanity and structure! Brandt located Jobriath in California, where he was living in an unfurnished apartment and working as a prostitute. Brandt: In walked this beautiful creature dressed in white. I said, Why dont you come out to Malibu and hang out? This became a feature of the mythology used to promote Jobriath, and helps to explain the acrimony that followed the dissolution of their professional and personal relationship. Brandt signed Jobriath, now calling himself Jobriath Boone, to Elektra Records for a reported 500,000, in what was allegedly the most lucrative recording contract of its time. Jobriath was signed to a two-album deal. A huge marketing campaign and media blitz ensued, including full-page advertisements in Vogue, Penthouse, and Rolling Stone magazines, full-length posters on over 250 New York City buses and a huge 41 ft 12 m by 43 ft 13 m billboard in Times Square. All featured the forthcoming debut album sleeve design by noted photographer Shig Ikeda, which featured a nude Jobriath, made to resemble an ancient Roman statue. Plans were announced for a lavish three night live debut at the Paris Opera that December, at a cost of 200,000 and a subsequent tour of European opera houses. Jobriath informed the press that the show would feature him dressed as King Kong being projected upwards on a mini Empire State Building. This will turn into a giant spurting penis and I will have transformed into Marlene Dietrich. Elektra, concerned about spiraling production costs, postponed the Paris Opera shows until February, later canceling them due to expense. Amidst this barrage of promotion, the debut album Jobriath was released on June 15, 1973, garnering mostly positive reviews. Rolli",

    "text": "Revelation 19 is the nineteenth chapter of the Book of Revelation or the Apocalypse of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The book is traditionally attributed to John the Apostle, but the precise identity of the author remains a point of academic debate. In this chapter, heaven exults over the fall of Babylon the Great.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 21 verses.  Textual witnesses  Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: Codex Sinaiticus 330-360 Codex Alexandrinus 400-440 Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus ca. 450; extant verses 1-4  Old Testament references  Revelation 19:15: Psalm 2:89  New Testament references  Revelation 19:9: Matthew 22:1 Revelation 19:10: Revelation 22:9 Revelation 19:15: Revelation 2:26,27; 12:5 Revelation 19:16: Revelation 17:14  Structure  In the Jerusalem Bible, verses 1 to 10 conclude the section in chapters 17 and 18 dealing with the Punishment of Babylon, and verses 11 to 21 concern the first battle of the End.  The Fall of Babylon 19:18   Verse 1  After these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God! A full range of voices in heaven give praise to God for his judgment of Babylon.  John and the Angel 19:910   Verse 9  Then he said to me, Write: Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb! And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God. In place of he said, many English translations infer that the speaker is an angel, because in verse 10 he forgoes being worshipped and calls himself your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges assumes that this angel and the one who came forward in Revelation 17:1 are the same.  The Rider from Heaven and his Victory 19:1121   Verse 11  Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. According to the Jerusalem Bible, the white horse symbolises victory. According to Methodist writer Joseph Benson, it was intended to denote Jesus justice and holiness, and also that victory and triumph should mark his progress. The horse may be contrasted with the colt or ass on which Jesus rode into Jerusalem Matthew 21:17 etc. and the biblical prophecy underpinning the gospel accounts Zechariah 9:9. The ass is for peace, but the horse was used for war.  Verse 12  His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.  Verse 13  He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. The person of Jesus, as the truth and the one who has supremely witnessed to the truth of God in his life and his death, comes to earth and is the Word of God in person.  Verse 15  Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. Sharp or sharp two-edged.  Uses   Literature  M. R.

    "text": "The Marquisate of Fosdinovo was a small fiefdom, led by a Marquess, that existed in the Italian peninsula between 1355 and 1797. It was based around Fosdinovo, a city east of La Spezia, and was ruled by the Malaspinas, a prominent Italian family, throughout its existence.  Founding of the Marquisate  The Marquisate of Fosdinovo was established around 1355 when Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg visited the area and granted the rank of Marquisate to Galeotto I Malaspina. The area Galeotto I took control of had been owned by the Bishops of Luni and had been occupied by Lucca not long before this. In 1393, Galetto I died, and his sons split the Marquisate into small territories for themselves. Under Gabriele II 1467 - 1508, the Marquisate developed and expanded significantly. in 1468, an oratory was built, followed by several other religious buildings in the next few decades.  End of the Marquisate  Carlo Emanuele became the ruler of the Marquisate in 1759, thirty years before the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars began. Eventually, the fiefdom was occupied by the Republic of France. With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars and the establishment of the Congress of Vienna, Fosdinovo was put under the control of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. Towards the end of the 19th century, descendants of the Marquises that formerly ruled over the country regained possession of the towns castle. They still own it to this day.

Foundation  The large Monotype printing business with U.S. base founded its British centre on obtaining London funding in 1897 in Salfords. It occupied a growing industrial base by the railway station, Salfords, on the Brighton Main Line from London and men in its workforce founded the club on an informal basis before World War II. The patent-based technical printing business with a large library of type faces was known variously under brand names Monotype or Monotype Typography. The club qualified and contributed as one of the founding clubs of the Surrey Premier League in 1982. The business was divided up in 1992: the hardware sold to IPA Group; the type department, having produced the TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1 with Microsoft, continued as Monotype Typography, integrated into the Agfa part of Monotypes parent business in 1998. Its typefaces included Albion, Goudy Old Style and Times New Roman.  Merger and relocation  In 2007, the football club merged with Coulsdon Town to form Coulsdon United in Coulsdon, Greater London, freeing up its original ground to generate capital.

    "text": "The United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS is a non-profit scientific and educational organization that administers the only Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network OPTN in the United States, established under the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 by Gene A. Pierce, founder of United Network for Organ Sharing. Located in Richmond, Virginia, the organizations headquarters are situated near the intersection of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64 in the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park.  Activities  United Network for Organ Sharing is involved in many aspects of the organ transplant and donation process: Managing the national transplant waiting list, matching donors to recipients. Maintaining the database that contains all organ transplant data for every transplant event that occurs in the U.S. Bringing together members to develop policies that make the best use of the limited supply of organs and give all patients a fair chance at receiving the organ they need, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, religion, lifestyle, or financialsocial status. Monitoring every organ match to ensure organ allocation policies are followed. Providing assistance to patients, family members and friends. Educating transplant professionals about their important role in the donation and transplant processes. Educating the public about the importance of organ donation.  History  United Network for Organ Sharing was awarded the initial Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network contract on September 30, 1986, and it is the only organization to ever manage the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. United Network for Organ Sharing provides the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network with a functional, effective management system incorporating the Board of Directors, committees and regional membership to operate OPTN elements and activities. In late December 2013, it was announced that United Network for Organ Sharing had developed new policies and regulations governing the new field of hand and face transplants like it does standard organ transplants, giving more Americans who are disfigured by injury or illness a chance at reconstruction. In July 2014, government regulations went into effect making hand and face transplants subject to the same oversight by United Network for Organ Sharing as heart or kidney transplants. The rules mean potential transplant recipients will be added to the United Network for Organ Sharing network, for matching of donated hands and face tissue to ensure correct tissue type and compatibility for skin color, size, gender and age. Transplants and their outcomes will be tracked. In 2020, the Senate Finance Committee launched a bipartisan investigation into UNOS, seeking information into various abuses and patient harms. In 2022, the committee published a bipartisan report concluding that From the top down, the U.S. transplant network is not working, putting Americans lives at risk.. UNOS has also come under intense scrutiny for issues related to outdated and insecure technology, as well as failing to address fatal patient safety risks and anti-patient misinformation. An investigation by the United States Senate Committee on Finance published in August 2022 catalogs over a thousand complaints from the previous decade, including patient deaths and injuries caused by failures to check for disease and match blood type. At an oversight hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out that UNOS is 15 times more likely to lose or damage an organ in transit as an airline is to lose or damage your luggage. Temperature regulation during transport can also be problematic.  Regions  United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network operate by grouping states into several different regions throughout the country. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Eastern Vermont Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the part of Northern Virginia in the Donation Service Area served by the Washington Regional Transplant Community DCTC Organ procurement organization Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Puerto Rico Oklahoma and Texas Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wyoming New York and Western Vermont Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and most of Virginia  Allocation  United Network for Organ Sharing uses a set policy to remove as much subjectivity as possible from the process of matching organs with recipients referred to as a match run. There are several factors that are involved, including, but not limited to: Age Ability of the patient to recover ABO though very young recipients are often considered for",

    "text": "Pate Hole is a solutional cave located adjacent to Asby Gill 1 kilometre 0.62 mi south of Great Asby in Cumbria, England. It is 970 metres 3,180 ft long and has a vertical range of 33 metres 108 ft. The entrance is normally dry, but in flood it becomes an impressive resurgence. Its name derives from the north country word for badger. It consists of three main passages. From the entrance a stooping height passage heading south-east reaches a large 6 metres 20 ft deep pool after 330 metres 1,080 ft from which a stream emerges. This flows down a low passage to the north for some 270 metres 890 ft where a sump is reached. The third main passage continues south underwater from the pool for 225 metres 738 ft at a depth of 27 metres 89 ft where it reaches a junction and becomes too restricted. The cave is formed in Carboniferous limestone, and is thought to drain the Great Asby Scar area 3 kilometres 1.9 mi to the south-west. The resurgence is presumed to be St. Thomass Well in Great Asby. The main part of the cave has been known for a long time, and it was an object of curiosity in the nineteenth century. A brief foray into it was described in The Gentlemans Magazine in 1791, and a description appeared in The Monthly Magazine in 1802. The first full description complete with passage lengths appeared in 1813. The first account of an exploration by cavers was in 1941 by members of the Yorkshire Ramblers Club, and in November 1946 it was surveyed by a group from Appleby Grammar School led by Brian Price. The upstream sump was first dived for about 10 metres 33 ft to a descending rift in 1960 by members of the Cave Diving Group, at which time the main part of the cave was re-surveyed by Warburton et alia. Further exploration took place in 1975-1976 by members of the same group to reach the current limit.  References",

She tells him her name is Isabella and that she is an exchange student staying there while the Cusamanos are away. Tony takes her out to lunch and she describes the beauty of Avellino, where Tonys grandfather came from. He has a daydream about Isabella in a rocking chair in a village house, nursing a baby named Antonio. One day, Isabella is no longer there. When the Cusamanos return, Tony asks about her and realizes he has been hallucinating. Dr. Melfi instructs him to stop taking lithium and theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure. Mikey, acting through Donnie Paduana, contracts two gunmen to carry out the hit on Tony. Uncle Junior cannot bear to hear the details of the plan when Mikey tries to report. Meanwhile, Christopher is concerned about Tonys emotional state and secretly follows him; he unknowingly prevents the hit when he pulls his car up next to the assassins, blocking their view of Tony. Mikey and Donnie urgently meet about the failed attempt, with Junior hiding in the backseat of Mikeys car. Donnie promises to try the hit again the next day and casually remarks that even Tonys mother wants him dead. Junior, fearing Donnies big mouth, has Mikey kill him. The next day, the assassins make their move while Tony is running errands, only for one hitman to accidentally kill the other. After a ferocious struggle, Tony leaves the other gunman on the street and drives away, but crashes into a parked car. At the hospital, Tony says that his injuries occurred in an attempted carjacking, a story that not even A.J. believes. FBI Agent Harris comes to his bed and offers a deal, including immunity from prosecution, which Tony scornfully rejects. The next day, Livia and Junior visit Tony at home. Livia appears not to know who Meadow is; Junior later comments on the good timing of this apparent memory loss.  Reception  Alan Sepinwall has lauded Isabella as one of the greatest episodes of The Sopranos. Emily St. James found the subplot with the titular character to be outlandish, but still described the episode as featuring classic scene after classic scene.

    "text": "Drew: The Man Behind the Poster is a 2013 American documentary film about the career of film poster artist Drew Struzan. It is directed by Erik Sharkey and premiered on July 19, 2013 at San Diego Comic-Con.  Synopsis  The documentary features interviews with a number of people, including Struzan himself, his wife, Dylan Struzan, his son, Christian Struzan, directors Steven Spielberg, Guillermo del Toro and George Lucas, and actors Harrison Ford and Michael J. Fox. The film follows Struzans career painting movie posters for films such as Star Wars, The Thing, Back to the Future, the Indiana Jones franchise, and the Harry Potter franchise. The film delves into Struzans art for Alice Coopers album Welcome to My Nightmare, and also how his artwork for Guillermo del Toros Hellboy, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, and Pans Labyrinth, though greatly admired by del Toro, was rejected by the studio in favor of more photographic posters. This leads the documentary in a direction about how film studios are interested more in profit rather than quality, how film posters are more often photographs of the actors rather than paintings of them. The documentary concludes with footage of Struzan at San Diego Comic-Con in 2010, wherein he receives the Inkpot Award for his illustrations. This is then followed by footage of Struzan talking about and showing his personal paintings not related to film, and how he spends his time painting not for someone else, but for himself, and how he often plays outside with grandson, Nico.  Critical reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 44 based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 5.810. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews. Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film becomes a mildly taxing torrent. And Mr. Struzan, while an agreeable presence, is not an especially engrossing speaker. Peter Debruge of Variety called the documentary sophomore effort that is no masterpiece, although noting that he owned a Struzan poster himself and admired Struzans impressive oeuvre. Nick Schager of The A.V. Club appreciated that the documentary makes a valid case for the artist as not simply an all-time great, but as a casualty of a business that prizes bottom-line cost management above unique creativity; however, he disliked the films focus on lavishing adulation on Struzan.

    "text": "Veerateeswarar Temple also called Vazhuvur Veerateeswarar temple is a Hindu temple located at Vazhuvur in Mayiladuthurai district of Tamil Nadu, India. The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Bala Gujambigai. The village is mentioned in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Vaippu Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it. As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished the elephant taking the form of Gajasamhara. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty during the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam.  Legend  According to Hindu mythology, once, some sages doubting the omnipotence of the god Shiva created an elephant and challenged the god to a duel. Shiva took the form of Gajasamharamurti or slayer of the elephant and killed the elephant and wore its skin as a garment. As per another version, the sages residing in Tharukavana wanted Shiva to repent for his act of coming as Bhikshatana and inducing their wives to get them into conjugal mood. They created an elephant to fight against Shiva. Shiva tore open the elephant, whose skin started burning. The elephant fell in the Panchamuga tank opposite to the temple. Shiva is believed to have dipped in the northeast part of the tank and emerged from the southwest part of the tank. The aspect of Shiva is also known as Kirthivasa or one who wears an elephant skin as garment. Vazhuvur is also one of the places where Siva danced his cosmic dance to crush the demon of ignorance. Since the demon Taraka inhabited this place, the forest is named Tharuka Vanam the forest of Taruka. The place has other names like Parakayilayam, Gananbumi, Suyathapuri and Piplaraynam. During the great deluge, the village alone was not affected, leading to the Tamil name of Vazhuvur the place which is not affected.  Architecture  The temple is located in Vazhuvur, a village 2 km 1.2 mi away from manganallur in Mayiladuthurai - Thiruvarur road. The temple faces the East and has a five-tiered rajagopuram. The temple tank, the Panchamuga Theertham is located outside the main entrance. The sanctum houses the image of Veeratneeswarar in the form of lingam. The sanctum has ardhamandapa before it and a Mahamandapa, the worship hall. The Mahamandapa houses the metal image of Gajasamharamurthy sported with six hands holding six different weapons and shown emanating out of elephant with elephant skin at his foot. The image is in the form of Om. The Mahamandapam also houses other metal images of Murugan, Somaskanda and Vinayagar. The shrine of Ambal in the form of Gnangmigai faces South. The image is sported in standing posture with four hands. The temple has two precincts and all the shrines in the temple are enshrined in rectangular granite walls. The temple has other important sculptures in the panels around the sanctum. The temple dates from the time of the Medieval Cholas. The Gajasamharamurti idol was sculpted in the 11th century. The temple is built in the Dravidian style of architecture and is known for its exquisite bronze icons. Some of the popular bronze idols are those of Gajasamharamurti and Bhikshadana Shiva as mendicant. Most of the inscriptions in the temple are dated from the period of Medieval Cholas from 1160 to 1276 CE. The image of Parvathi holding Murugan is a notable sculpture in the temple.  Religious significance  As per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons namely Andakasuran, Gajasuran, Jalandasuran, Thirupuradhi, Kaman, Arjunan, Dakshan and Taaragasuran. There are Ashta Veeratanam temples built signifying each of his victories in the war, and also as places where he is believed to have performed with fury. The eight temples are: Tiruvadigai Veerattaaneswarar Temple at Thiruvadigai, Tirukkovilur Veerateshwarar Temple at Tirukoilur, Veerateswarar temple at Vazhuvur or Thirukkurukkai, Amirtagateswarar Temple at Thirukadaiyur, Vazhuvur Verateswarar Temple at Vazhuvoor, Keelaparasalur Veerateswarar Temple at Tirupariyalur, Kandeeswarar Temple at Thirukkandiyur and Tiruvirkudi Veerataneswarar Temple at Thiruvirkudi. Shiva in all these temples are described to have used bow and arrow, trident and spear. It is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Appar.  Festival and religious practices  The temple priests perform the pooja rituals during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva tem",

    "text": "KUSI-TV channel 51, cable channel 9 is an independent television station in San Diego, California, United States. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside Fox affiliate KSWB-TV channel 69. The two stations share studios on Viewridge Avenue near I-15 in the Kearny Mesa section of San Diego; KUSI-TVs transmitter is located southeast of Spring Valley. After a 15-year dispute over permit ownership that almost derailed the launch of the station on multiple occasions, KUSI began broadcasting in 1982 as a partnership between United States International University and McKinnon Broadcasting Company. It was the first independent station built in San Diego proper. Financial and accreditation problems at USIU led to the sale of its stake to McKinnon in 1990, with McKinnon exercising veto power to block any sale to another entity. McKinnon then started KUSIs news department, which has since grown to produce newscasts throughout the day. In 2023, McKinnon sold KUSI to Nexstar. The stations transmitter broadcasts KUSI and KSWB-TV in ATSC 3.0 NextGen TV format.  History   15 years of fighting  The construction permit for a channel 51 television station in San Diego was first issued on June 23, 1965, to Jack O. Gross, who had previously founded KFMB-TV channel 8, as KJOG-TV. The permit was issued after applications by Gross and California Western University of San Diego were filed the year before; Gross proposed a conventional independent station, while the private university planned a station with a high educational and cultural content. In October 1967, with the station still unbuilt, California Western filed to have the station transferred to it, stating that Gross was refusing to abide by an agreement reached that April to sell the station to CWU for 16,000 in expenses. However, a complication arose when Gross informed the Federal Communications Commission FCC that he had reached another deal to sell the station to the Broadmoor Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Michael and Dan McKinnon alongside local radio stations KSON 1240 AM and KSEA 97.3 FM and television station KIII of Corpus Christi, Texas, for 15,000. Under that agreement, Broadmoor would honor a deal brokered with the university, which had also applied for the channel, to acquire 50 percent. The situation, in which Gross reached sale agreements with two different buyers, prompted the FCC to designate an application to extend the life of the construction permit for hearing in late 1968, by which time the university had changed its name to United States International University USIU. FCC administrative law judge Basil P. Cooper in 1970 ruled that Gross had trafficked in the permit, by retaining an interest without the obligation to make further funds available, but granted the time extension. However, the FCCs review board, later joined by the full commission, reversed the initial decision in 1972 and denied the application for more time to build the station. A year later, however, the commission granted authority to extend the permit in order to consider the 1967 application to sell it to USIU, finding that Grosss actions did not merit immediate disqualification and would unfairly harm USIU. Broadmoor continued to challenge any authority by USIU to build KJOG-TV, and in 1975, the FCC designated the universitys acquisition of the construction permit for hearing, this time over concerns about whether USIU was financially qualified to construct the station and whether financial issues at the university itself, spurred by a long-delayed and complicated land sale in the early 1970s and the collapse of one of the universitys major lenders, weighed on its capacity. A religious group, Christian Communications Network, intervened in the proceeding in a bid to seek the use of the channel; it provided Christian television programming on local cable. On June 7, 1977, administrative law judge David I. Kraushaar ruled against the proposed transfer to USIU and its affiliate University Television, Inc., concerned over the financial issues and by cost estimates that were extremely low during a period of major inflation.  Early years and sale to McKinnon  In October 1980, administrative law judge James F. Tierney finally adjudicated the matter for good and granted the transfer application to University Television, dismissing Christian Communicationss complaints as unfounded. Even though the university was still showing signs of financial stress, two private financiersUSIU trustee Predrag Mitrovich and St. Louis businessman Allen Portnoystepped in to provide the necessary funding. A year later, USIU hired the McKinnons to provide financial and management support to USIU, with an option to buy a minority stake. On September 13, 1982more than 17 years after the permit was grantedthe station finally began broadcasting as KUSI-TV. It operated as a general entertainment independent station, airing a mix of childrens programs",

    "text": "The Passion of Dionysus is the fifteenth album by New York heavypower metal group Virgin Steele, released via SPVSteamhammer worldwide on June 30, 2023. The concept album tells the story of the Greek god Dionysus and his coming to Thebes to avenge the slander of his mother how it is described in Euripides tragic play, The Bacchae. It explores the duality of the human emotional world between the rational and the irrational, thus taking up one of the most important themes of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The album received mostly positive reviews, but was also met with some criticism. While many critics praised the complex compositions as well as the innovative songwriting, the production was often criticized for being too artificial. Paul Hutchings of Metaltalk.net called The Passion of Dionysus a creative masterpiece. With a duration of almost 13-minutes, The Ritual of Descent is the longest single track the band has ever released.  Track listing  All music and lyrics by David DeFeis  Reception  For those who have followed VIRGIN STEELE all these years, this will not be unfamiliar terrain at all. This will be what they were expecting. High quality music brought to us by an extremely dedicated David DeFeis, who did all of it, except for the guitar parts. And I for one applaud him, because he has made The Passion Of Dionysus into a very good record, making sure that VIRGIN STEELE is once again noticed as a force to be reckoned with.

    "text": "The Quesnel River is a major tributary of the Fraser River in the Cariboo District of central British Columbia. It begins at the outflow of Quesnel Lake, at the town of Likely and flows for about 100 kilometres 60 mi northwest to its confluence with the Fraser at the city of Quesnel.  History  Just downstream from the outlet of Quesnel Lake, at the confluence of the Cariboo River, is the historically important ghost town of Quesnel Forks, a.k.a. the Forks, which was a junction point of the Quesnel and Cariboo Rivers. Various trails and wagon roads leading to the Cariboo goldfields lay across the low-hill range north of Quesnel Forks in the basin of the Cottonwood River. Both the Lillooet to Fort Alexandria wagon road and the later Cariboo Wagon Road came by Quesnel Forks but preferred to follow the valley of the Quesnel River to Quesnel and then east from there to the gold towns of Barkerville and Wells. The river took its name from Jules-Maurice Quesnel, who explored this region with Simon Fraser in 1808.  Natural history  The Quesnel River supports a number of fish species, the most significant of which are Sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Largescale sucker Catostomus macrocheilus, Longnose sucker Catostomus catostomus, Redside shiner Richardsonius balteatus, Northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis, Peamouth chub Mylocheilus caurinus, and Lake chub Couesius plumbeus. The salmon run of sockeye salmon experienced a major recovery in the late 20th century, sometimes surpassing the Adams River as the greatest sockeye producer in the Fraser basin. However, the river, wildlife, and nearby water sources is threatened by 10 million cubic meters of contaminated mine waste that escaped in August 2014.

Administration  The district has 6 communes, 34 villages as of 2019.  History  This ancient city was an important settlement of the Kingdom of Funan and may have been its capital. It may have been the Thinae, or Sinae Metropolis located by Claudius Ptolemy as the farthest known city to the east in his Geography. The site was first excavated in 1996 and was again excavated in 1999 as part of the Lower Mekong Archaeological Project. During the 1996 excavation, the University of Hawaii and the Royal University of Fine Arts initiated the excavation and focused on the sociopolitical complexity from 500 BC to 500 AD. This first excavation, however, was just preliminary research. The first objectives were: 1 Documentation of the sites layout and the range of its archaeological features 2 Evaluation of the integrity of subsurface materials and description of the sites stratigraphy 3 Collection of samples for dating portions of the archaeological site 4 Reconstructing the hydrology and natural environment of the early historic period in this region In this site various archaeological methods were used such as surface survey and mapping, test excavations, auger sampling and coring, and trenching with a backhoe. Unfortunately, the archeological project was disturbed by looting and illicit trafficking of Khmer antiquities, which continues as a serious problem into the 21st century.

    "text": "The Marsh Arabs Arabic: عرب الأهوار ʻArab al-Ahwār Arabs of the Marshlands, also referred to as Ahwaris, the Maʻdān Arabic: معدان dweller in the plains or Shroog Mesopotamian Arabic: شروگ those from the eastthe latter two often considered derogatory in the present dayare indigenous inhabitants of the Mesopotamian marshlands in the modern-day south Iraq, as well as in the Hawizeh Marshes straddling the IranIraq border. Comprising members of many different tribes and tribal confederations, such as the Āl Bū Muḥammad, Ferayghāt, Shaghanbah, Ahwaris had developed a culture centered on the marshes natural resources. Many of the marshes inhabitants were forcibly displaced during the Ahwari Genocide when the wetlands were drained during and after the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.  History   Origin theories  The origins of the Ahwari people are still a matter of some dispute. British colonial ethnographers found it difficult to classify some of Ahwaris social customs and speculated that they might have originated in Indus Valley Pakistan. They may have descended from the Zuṭṭ Jat people, who moved to the region of lower Iraq in the 8th and 9th centuries and followed similar customs and traditions. Some scholars such as Ali al-Wardi have claimed they are descended from the Nabataeans of Iraq, the Aramaic-speaking people who inhabited Lower Mesopotamia in the Middle Ages, and some of their clans even follow their ancestry to Islamized Mandaeans. Other scholars have proposed historical and genetic links between the Marsh Arabs and the ancient Sumerians due to shared agricultural practices, methods of house-building and location. There is, however, no written record of the marsh tribes until the ninth century and the Sumerians lost their distinct ethnic identity by around 1800 BCE, some 2700 years before. Links to Sumerian genetics can be traced back to the Arabization and assimilation of indigenous Mesopotamians. Others, however, have noted that much of the culture of Ahwaris is shared with the desert bedouin who came to the area after the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate.  19912003  The marshes had for some time been considered a refuge for elements persecuted by the government of Saddam Hussein, as in past centuries they had been a refuge for escaped slaves and serfs, such as during the Zanj Rebellion. By the mid-1980s, a low-level insurgency against Baathist drainage and resettlement projects had developed in the area, led by Sheik Abdul Kerim Mahud al-Muhammadawi of the Al bu Muhammad under the nom de guerre Abu Hatim. During the 1970s, the expansion of irrigation projects had begun to disrupt the flow of water to the marshes. However, after the First Gulf War 1991, the Iraqi government aggressively revived a program to divert the flow of the Tigris River and the Euphrates River away from the marshes in retribution for a failed Shia uprising. This was done primarily to eliminate the food sources of the Marsh Arabs and to prevent any remaining militiamen from taking refuge in the marshes, the Badr Brigades and other militias having used them as cover. The plan, which was accompanied by a series of propaganda articles by the Iraqi regime directed against the Madan, systematically converted the wetlands into a desert, forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. Villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned. The majority of Ahwaris were displaced either to areas adjacent to the drained marshes, abandoning their traditional lifestyle in favour of conventional agriculture, to towns and camps in other areas of Iraq or to Iranian refugee camps. Only 1,600 of them were estimated to still be living on traditional dibins by 2003. The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes had become completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes had dramatically shrunk. The Marsh Arabs, who numbered about half a million in the 1950s, have dwindled to as few as 20,000 in Iraq, according to the United Nations. As of 2003, an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 have fled to refugee camps in Iran. However, following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover, and many have returned to their native lands. The Observers Middle East correspondent Shyam Bhatia who spent two weeks with the Marsh Arabs in 1993 wrote the first eyewitness account of Iraqi army tactics at the time of draining the marshes, bombing Marsh villages and then sowing mines in the water before retreating. Bhatias extensive reportage won him the title of International Reporter of the Year, al",

    "text": "Augustinerkloster was one of the eight monasteries within the medieval city of Zürich in Switzerland. It was founded around 1270 as an Augustinian Order priory on the site of the present Augustinerkirche Zürich on Münzplatz, and was abolished in 1524.  Geography  Situated on todays Münzplatz that is named after the later mint, the street Augustinergasse is named after the abbey. The area of the convent was west of the St. Peterhofstatt square towards the then Fröschengraben moat. The Augustinerkirche Zürich, like the street with the same name, is named after the former Augustinian monastery, meaning the church of the Augustinian order. In the high European Middle Ages, the abbey was part of the fortifications of Zürich, situated on the lower slope of the Lindenhof hill, at the location of the so-called small Kecinstürlin gate at the southern Fröschengraben moat, the Augustinertor gate. The inner moat was enforced by the 16th-century Schanzengraben.  History  The city of Zürich supported the popular mendicant orders of the times by attributing free plots in the suburbs, requiring them to assist with the construction of the city wall in return. In the west of the area, the citys fortification was not yet built in the late 11th or 12th century, and the Augustinian monks were allowed to settle there. The monastery consisted of the present Romanesque church, and a building complex attached to the north of the church. The important late medieval city fortifications, namely the Augustinertor and the Augustinerturm tower gates, are mentioned as its western section. Until the 14th century memorial measurements in Zürich, as a basis for the increasing income, had to be held at Grossmünster. By 1524 all income obtained from funerals had also to be given to the Grossmünster abbey. Hence, like the other mendicant orders, the Augustinians were reduced to the status of area pastors within the medieval city. As a result, the order supported the Brun regime of the Guilds of Zürich and may therefore not have lost as much influence as its brother convents within the city walls, namely the Predigerkloster which even had to leave the city for one decade. During the Reformation in Zürich, the convent was abolished in 1524, worship in the church was discontinued, and the buildings and income of the monastery were assigned to an Amt, conducting administration for the city government Rat. In 1525 a wine press was installed, an alms institution established, and thereafter the administration was integrated in the so-called Rütiamt, the former Rüti Abbey. In 1841 the Roman Catholic community of Zürich planned to build a church to commemorate the old Augustinian church. But, as the majority of the Catholic community rejected the decisions of the First Vatican Council of 1870, the whole community was expelled from the Catholic church, forming the present Christkatholische Kirche der Schweiz. This explains why Augustinerkirche is still its Parish church.  Buildings  There was considerable construction activity, when the mendicant order, near the present Strohof Augustinergasse 3 from Werner Strouhmeier acquired the estates of that name in 1270. The order had to build the section of the town wall, south of the Lindenhof hill and St. Peterhofstatt towards the Fröschengraben moat. The monastery complex consisted of a rectangular four bay wing, housing the later Rütiamt, where the Augustinerturm gate was erected. On both sides of the lower edge of the roof of the tower, there were the two wings of the so-called Almosen office of 1524. The transverse wing was used as the refectory, the monks dining hall. The monastery area was separated by a wall from the urban environment. On the northwestern narrow side of the monastery, there is the present Augustinerkirche, the nave and chancel under one roof. The present roof skylights disappeared in 1692, and were rebuilt in 193637.  Stained glass windows  In 1519 the Augustinian community petitioned the governments of the thirteen members of the Old Swiss Confederacy for chapter house windows. The canton of Fribourg approved and one of the windows showed the attached coat of arms, marking a community foundation of Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen and Appenzell. The art dealer Martin Usteri acquired 32 glass panes in 1796, which were sold from his legacy in 1829, and came into the Gröditzberg in Silesia. From there, six of the former stained glass windows were bought by the Gottfried Keller Foundation in 1894, exhibited in the cloister of the Fraumünster cathedral, and then entrusted to the Swiss National Museum on deposit.

    "text": "Bug! is a 1995 platform game developed by Realtime Associates and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It was also ported to Windows 3.1x and Windows 95 in 1996 by Beam Software. The game is one of the earliest examples of 3D platforming, as well as one of the first platform games released on the Saturn. Character movement is restricted to a track, unlike many games in the genre that allow for unrestricted movement in all directions. The game centers around Bug, a green bug  and Hollywood actor  who hopes to gain fame by defeating the villainous Queen Cadavra. The game was developed with the titular character being considered a possible mascot for the Saturn. Although Bug! failed to capture consumers attention, it received positive reviews upon its release, with praise for its graphics and visual effects and criticism for its music and voice acting. It was followed by the sequel Bug Too! in 1996.  Gameplay  Bug! is a 3D platform game which revolves around the player safely progressing through various levels. The game is set on Bug Island and consists of six worlds made up of three levels each, with each last level culminating in a mandatory boss fight. Enemies come in the form of insects, mollusks, reptiles, amphibians, and arachnids. Enemies are defeated by jumping on them, as well as utilizing power-ups which include damage dealing spittle and electrical strikes. Each level ends when the player jumps on a Bug Stop, which will then make the player proceed to the next level. Every level contains collectable items: 1-UPs supply the player with an extra life, collecting a heart will restore one hit point to the player whereas Bug Juice will fully replenish it, and a coin will allow the player to take part in a bonus round whereby they are given the chance to win more lives. If the player runs out of Bug Juice, they lose a life. The game will end once the player runs out of continues. Collectable items in the form of blue crystals are found scattered throughout the games levels. If the player collects 100 of them, they will earn an extra life along with a dragonfly icon, in which three icons are needed for the player to take part in a special bonus round involving a dragonfly ring chase. In addition, the player can collect power ups which will enable them to defeat enemies instantly. These come in the form of spit and zap attacks; the former allows Bug to fire missiles made out of saliva, and the latter unleashes a bolt of electricity. The levels featured in Bug! are linear  the player may only move in four directions despite the game appearing in full 3D. In addition to walking on a grid axis, the player-character can also walk up walls and upside down.  Plot  The games plot centers around the titular character, Bug, who is a Hollywood actor hoping to make his biggest break. Bug decides to sign up for the lead role in an upcoming action film, in which his family - composed of his pet, Maggot Dog, his younger brother, his girlfriend, his mother and his father - is captured by the villainous spider Queen Cadavra and must set out to rescue them. After traversing through insect infested grasslands, a reptile ruled dessert, a dangerous swamp, the bottom of the sea, a frozen tundra wasteland, and a volcanic mountain; he rescues his family one by one, defeating those Queen Cadarva left to hold them before facing the spider queen herself. Despite it being part of a movie, Cadarva was an actual villain who was aiming to take Bug out for real, even bringing in real monsters to aid her a cybernetically-enhanced snail, a giant reptile, a deadly sea snake, a monstrous octopus, and an abominable snow-bug. After a fierce fight, Bug manages to defeat her by pushing her into the volcano revealed to be real which destroys her. Afterwards, a movie is made of the events with no one knowing that what happened on it was real as Bug and his family attend its premier.  Development and release  Sega of America contracted Realtime Associates to create a Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Sega Saturns North American launch. When Sega of Japan rejected the use of Sonic, the Bug character, originally from a shelved Sega Genesis game, was chosen instead. Bug! was conceptualized as one of three candidates for mascots for Segas upcoming Sega Saturn console in 1994. The other candidates were 2.5D platformers Clockwork Knight which came out shortly before Bug! at the Saturns North American launch and Astal, which was released later in 1995. Realtime Associates developed the game using Silicon Graphics workstations, which were then used to pre-render the games characters and then convert them into sprites  in similar vein to the process used in Donkey Kong Country. According to producer Steve Apour: Once we were working on Bug!, wed meet twice a week to talk about gameplay, just to plow through it and decide what the system could do. Some ideas we werent able to include, such as the wait anima",

Flavio, Claudios uncle, informs him that after being arrested, Federico will reveal where he acquired the bomb. Because Federico is the son of a medic and a director, he wont be sent to jail. However, if the police discover Claudios guns, Claudio will surely be imprisoned. Consequently, Flavio orders Claudio to kill Federico. When Claudio confronts Federico, he discovers that Federico is the son of Pierpaolo, the medic who saved his mothers life, and aborts the mission. When Flavio demands an explanation, Claudio brings his 12-year-old gun-loving son, Cesare, to the meeting. Cesare shoots and kills Flavio with a shotgun. Claudio is arrested but retains his parental rights. A few months later, Bruno dies from brain cancer, which Pierpaolo had diagnosed. Gaia manages to find a new boyfriend in the very watch seller who triggered the entire series of events.

    "text": "See Template:Non-free Parliamentary copyright for Wikipedias image licensing tag. Parliamentary copyright is a form of copyright in works made by either of the two Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: the House of Lords or the House of Commons. It also applies to bills proposed in either House and to the devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom: the Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly or Senedd Cymru  the Welsh Parliament.  History  Parliamentary copyright was first created in the United Kingdom by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Prior to this legislation being passed, what is now covered by parliamentary copyright was Crown copyright. Parliamentary works produced prior to 1 August 1989 are therefore Crown, rather than parliamentary, copyright.  Application  Parliamentary copyright applies where a work is made by or under the direction or control of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Where parliamentary copyright applies, the work qualifies for copyright protection even though the usual requirements relating to qualifications for copyright protection may not apply. The House by whom, or under whose direction or control, the work is made is the first owner of any copyright in the work, and if the work is made by or under the direction or control of both Houses, the two Houses are joint first owners of copyright. Copyright in such a work is referred to in this Part as parliamentary copyright, notwithstanding that it may be, or have been, assigned to another person. Parliamentary copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work lasts for 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was made. Works made by or under the direction or control of the House of Commons or the House of Lords includes work made by an officer or employee of that House in the course of his duties, and any sound recording, film or live broadcast of the proceedings of that House, but a work is not regarded as made by or under the direction or control of either House simply because it has been commissioned by or on behalf of that House. In the case of a work of joint authorship where Parliamentary copyright applies, Parliamentary copyright only extends to the portion that it applies to and not the whole work. For the purposes of holding and enforcing copyright, the two Houses of Parliament, which otherwise only exist during the lifetime of a Parliament and not during a dissolution or prorogation are treated as having the legal capacities of a body corporate. The copyrights created by the act are enforceable by and in the name of the Speaker of the House of Commons, or the Clerk of the Parliaments in respect of the House of Lords.  Legislation   Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom  Copyright in bills introduced into Parliament belongs to one or both of the Houses of Parliament. A bill is normally introduced into one of the two Houses first, and once it is approved by one it goes to the other. Copyright in public bills belongs to the House into which the bill is introduced, and if it is passed by that House, it is then shared by both Houses jointly. The copyright starts from the time when the text of the bill is handed in to the House in which it is introduced. Copyright in private bills belongs to both Houses jointly and starts from the time when a copy of the bill is first deposited in either House. Copyright in a personal bill belongs in the first instance to the House of Lords, and if it is passed by that House, it is then shared by both Houses jointly. This copyright only starts when the bill has First Reading in the House of Lords. This form of parliamentary copyright ceases when a bill is granted royal assent, or if the bill does not receive royal assent, on the withdrawal or rejection of the bill or the end of the session. However, copyright in a bill continues even if rejected by the House of Lords if, by virtue of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, it remains possible for it to be presented for royal assent in that session. Once parliamentary copyright starts to apply in relation to a bill, it removes any other form of copyright which might have applied.  Bills in other legislatures  The same principles apply in respect of bills introduced into the Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly or the Senedd Cymru  Welsh Parliament, from the point a bill is introduced until it is either given royal assent, or withdrawn or rejected. In these cases, the copyright belongs to the corporate body of the respective legislature: the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission or the Senedd Commission.  Acts  When a bill of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or one of the devolved legislatures is given royal assent by the King, it becomes an act. Royal assent is also given to Church of England measures. Parliamentary copyright ends on royal assent and instead",

Description  The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society Centre aims to contribute to the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical and inclusive automated decision-making ADM. It was established at RMIT in 2020 with funding from the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council ARC and other partners. The Centre examines the social and technical aspects of ADM, seeing automated systems as the outcomes of interactions between people, machines, data and institutions. It has a particular focus on the domains of news and media, transport and mobility, social services and health.  Projects and initiatives  Research projects at the ADMS Centre range across automated systems, from autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles to the recommendation systems deployed in digital media. Researchers work on technologies from machine learning to blockchain. Projects are concerned with a wide spectrum of problems from digital inclusion to disinformation, addressing developments primarily in Australia and the Global South. Centre projects include:  Australian Search Experience project  This research project is investigating if and how search results on Google differ for different people using a crowd-sourcing process recruited from Australian internet users. It follows on from a similar project run by Algorithm Watch in Germany in 2017. As of August 2020, the results indicated that search personalisation is limited; however for some topics, such as COVID-19, there might be a high level of curation.  Considerate and Accurate Multi-party Recommender Systems for Constrained Resources  This project aims to develop a next generation recommender system that enables equitable allocation of constrained resources. The project will produce novel hybrid socio-technical methods and resources to create a Considerate and Accurate REcommender System CARES, evaluated with social science and behavioural economics lenses. CARES aims to transform the sharing economy by delivering systems and methods that improve user and non-user experiences, business efficiency, and corporate social responsibility.  Automated decision-making and the law  Centre researchers Dan Hunter and Kimberlee Weatherall are investigating the role of artificial intelligence, natural language processing and other technologies which are having a major impact on decision-making and administration across the legal system.  Funding and partners  Total combined funding for the centre is A71.1 million with the ARC providing funding of A31.8 million over 7 years from 2020 until 2026. Centre partners include eight Australian universities and 22 organisations from around Australia, Europe, Asia and America. The Centre headquarters are located at RMIT University; the other Australian university partners are Monash University, Queensland University of Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, Western Sydney University, University of Sydney and University of Queensland.

It was founded in October 2005 by Greg Costikyan and Johnny L. Wilson, former editor of Computer Gaming World, and is based in New York City. The company was announced September 29, 2005. Costikyan was the companys CEO while Wilson was executive vice president for community and content. On June 23, 2009, Costikyan announced that Manifesto was closing its doors, citing the 2008-2009 economic downturn, a lack of venture capital, and problems successfully marketing the company as a destination for independent games. According to Manifesto Games manifesto, the company aimed to avoid the narrowness of conventional retail channels by selling a large number of games taking advantage of The Long Tail, and allow developers to experiment technically and artistically. An example of Manifesto Games willingness to take risks is its support of Super Columbine Massacre RPG!. The Manifesto Games website was originally designed in ironic imitation of the Soviet Union in its early years; some of its content still reflects this choice.  Play This Thing  Initially, Manifesto Games also provided reviews of indie games, including games it does not sell, and discussion forums. In September 2007, Manifesto Games created a new game review website, Play This Thing. A team of reviewers including Greg Costikyan and Emily Short posted one review per day at the website, covering independent, alternative reality and big urban games, interactive fiction, and mods. Most of the games reviewed had no relation to Manifesto Games. The site carried reviews of non-computer games on Tabletop Tuesdays. The site was shut down in 2014.

History  19th century The Teatro della Concordia was built at the beginning of the 19th century, during the epoch of the Napoleonic Wars invasion, by nine prosperous Umbrian families. They wanted to support cultural ideals beyond the French Revolutions goals, including: the spirit of freedom, equality and brotherhood. The new theatre was opened in 1808. The interior of the theatre was later decorated in 1892 with frescos by Luigi Agretti. 20th century Due to a post-war WW II deteriorated condition, the building was closed in 1951. Thirty years later, in 1981, the municipality of Monte Castello di Vibio purchased the theatre and restored it under the direction of the architects Paolo Leonelli and Mario Struzzi. The Teatro della Concordia was reopened in 1993. In the same year the association Società del Teatro della Concordia was founded. In 1997 the Teatro della Concordia started a partnership with the Teatro Farnese of Parma. In 2008 the exhibition area Sala Espositiva Nello Latini was opened in the basement of the Teatro della Concordia on the occasion of its 200 Year Jubilee.

    "text": "Edmund Zygfryd Trebus 11 November 1918  29 September 2002 was a compulsive hoarder who came to fame when he was featured on the British television documentary series A Life of Grime.  Biography  Edmund Trebus was born in Ostrowo, near Danzig Gdańsk, in what was then the newly established Weimar Republic now Poland, on 11 November 1918, the day of the Armistice. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 Trebus was conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He was then captured and served with the Allied forces in Italy, in an anti-tank unit of the II Corps of the Polish armed forces, which was under British command. After moving to England just after the Second World War, Trebus married Jozefa Noga in 1949. They had five children. Trebus had been a collector all his life and he was often seen pushing a handcart filled with his latest acquisitions, which he carefully sorted into separate piles in his garden and home. One of Trebuss major loves was Elvis Presley, and he managed to collect and store away a copy of almost every single Elvis record. In his eighties, living alone in a run-down house in Crouch End in North London, Trebus was constantly in trouble with the environmental health department of the London Borough of Haringey because of complaints about the rubbish surrounding his home. He lived in a tiny area on the ground floor of his house, surrounded by piles of rubbish, because he never threw anything away. In the BBC documentary series A Life of Grime, Trebus was repeatedly shown arguing with council workers who had been instructed to clear his house of the 515 cu yd 394 m3 of rubbish it contained. He was eventually rehoused at the Trentfield Nursing Home in Southgate, where he died at the age of 83. Following his death, the BBC broadcast an hour-long tribute, Mr Trebus: A Life of Grime.

He studied art from 1906 to 1910 at the School of Drawing and Painting in Vitebsk, under Yehuda Pen. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1910, to study at the School of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts from 1910 to 1911 and with artists Mstislav Dobuzhinsky and Moisey Bernstein from 1911 to 1913. From 1912 to 1914, Yudovin participated in the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition organized by S. An-skys Jewish Historical and Ethnographic Society, documenting and copying examples of Jewish folk art and ornaments. This sparked his lifelong interest in Jewish artistic traditions. In 1920 he, together with M. Malkin, published the album Jewish Folk Ornament Yidisher Folks-Ornament featuring 26 of his linocut prints. From 1918 to 1923, Yudovin lived in Vitebsk, teaching at the Art School and Jewish Pedagogical Technical School. His prints from this period often depicted shtetl life and Jewish folk themes, combining stylized folk elements with realistic details. After moving to Petrograd St. Petersburg in 1923, Yudovin worked as a curator at the Jewish Museum, created in materials of S. An-skys expedition, until its closure in 1928. In the 1930s to 1940s his work became more narrative and detailed to conform to Socialist Realism, though still focused on Jewish subjects and folk imagery. He illustrated books by Jewish authors and created prints portraying Jewish life on collective farms. Yudovin had solo exhibitions in Vitebsk 1926, Yaroslavl 1944, Leningrad 1956 and Jerusalem 1991. His art blended Russian avant-garde influence with a commitment to documenting and celebrating Jewish cultural traditions through his prints, drawings and book illustrations.

Recent advances in Large Language Models LLMs offer a transformative opportunity to enhance UAV intelligence beyond conventional optimization-based and learning-based approaches. By integrating LLMs into UAV systems, advanced environmental understanding, swarm coordination, mobility optimization, and high-level task reasoning can be achieved, thereby allowing more adaptive and context-aware aerial operations. This survey systematically explores the intersection of LLMs and UAV technologies and proposes a unified framework that consolidates existing architectures, methodologies, and applications for UAVs. We first present a structured taxonomy of LLM adaptation techniques for UAVs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG, and prompt engineering, along with key reasoning capabilities such as Chain-of-Thought CoT and In-Context Learning ICL. We then examine LLM-assisted UAV communications and operations, covering navigation, mission planning, swarm control, safety, autonomy, and network management. After that, the survey further discusses Multimodal LLMs MLLMs for human-swarm interaction, perception-driven navigation, and collaborative control. Finally, we address ethical considerations, including bias, transparency, accountability, and Human-in-the-Loop HITL strategies, and outline future research directions. Overall, this work positions LLM-assisted UAVs as a foundation for intelligent and adaptive aerial systems.",

While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebras structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: i how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, ii how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and iii to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebras representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics.",

While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7 in AUROCAUPRC and 1.1-1.7 in accuracyF1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform rawimputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction PhysioNet, 2019, where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2 AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6 lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.",

    "text": "The merit of Conformal Prediction CP, as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.",

We find that some failures are not purely idiosyncratic, transferring up to 12.02 across LLM assistants, and we connect these outcomes to secure architecture by outlining an LLM-in-the-loop evaluation pipeline: policy gating, retrieval grounding, structured templates, and lightweight verification checks that, when combined, reduce failures by 80.62.",

We present a large empirical study of agent-authored pull requests using the public AIDev dataset, examining integration outcomes, resolution speed, and review-time collaboration signals. Using logistic regression with repository-clustered standard errors, we find that reviewer engagement has the strongest correlation with successful integration, whereas larger change sizes and coordination-disrupting actions, such as force pushes, are associated with a lower likelihood of merging. In contrast, iteration intensity alone provides limited explanatory power once collaboration signals are considered. A qualitative analysis further shows that successful integration occurs when agents engage in actionable review loops that converge toward reviewer expectations. Overall, our results highlight that the effective integration of agent-authored pull requests depends not only on code quality but also on alignment with established review and coordination practices.",

Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested. We decompose this task into two phases: a domain-agnostic feasibility phase that iteratively repairs any LP using IIS-guided diagnosis, and a domain-specific validation phase that enforces five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory. We test 22 API models from seven families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models with self-taught reasoning and solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7 Rational Recovery Rate RRR -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2 for the best API model and 21.3 on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair, where API models average 27.6 recovery rate versus 97.2 for trained models. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction, as API models restore only 27.6 of infeasible formulations; and operational rationale, as roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory. Each gap requires a different intervention -- targeted training closes the solver interaction gap, while explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks closes the rationality gap. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what rational means in their context is the higher-return investment.",

While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing MS-DDSP bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN EPA-FPN as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8 mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8 while reducing parameters by 29.0, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.",

One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from frac14 to frac12. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8 in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.",

It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of MS in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and MS. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three.

We then examine the central role of MS in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches.

In this work, we hypothesize the existence of fixed golden layers that can achieve near-optimal editing performance similar to sample-wise optimal layers. To validate this hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence by comparing golden layers against ground-truth sample-wise optimal layers. Furthermore, we show that golden layers can be reliably identified using a proxy dataset and generalize effectively to unseen test set queries across datasets. Finally, we propose a novel method, namely Layer Gradient Analysis LGA that estimates golden layers efficiently via gradient-attribution, avoiding extensive trial-and-error across multiple editing runs.

We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations.

Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize.

Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.",

By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model.

Although stakeholders are calling for tools to manage increasingly large fleets of gliders, successful autonomous long-term deployments have thus far been scarce, which hints at a lack of suitable methodologies and systems. In this work, we formulate glider navigation planning as a stochastic shortest-path Markov Decision Process and propose a sample-based online planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. Samples are generated by a physics-informed simulator that captures uncertain execution of controls and ocean current forecasts while remaining computationally tractable. The simulator parameters are fitted using historical glider data. We integrate these methods into an autonomous command-and-control system for Slocum gliders that enables closed-loop replanning at each surfacing. The resulting system was validated in two field deployments in the North Sea totalling approximately 3 months and 1000 km of autonomous operation. Results demonstrate improved efficiency compared to straight-to-goal navigation and show the practicality of sample-based planning for long-term marine autonomy.",

At the same time, open-weight pre-trained models are currently more accessible than their proprietary training data. In this work, we present a two-stage training pipeline that leverages pre-trained models together with unlabeled audio. The proposed method decouples training into two stages. In the first stage, we use a pre-trained BTC model as a teacher to generate pseudo-labels for over 1,000 hours of diverse unlabeled audio and train a student model solely on these pseudo-labels. In the second stage, the student is continually trained on ground-truth labels as they become available, with selective knowledge distillation KD from the teacher applied as a regularizer to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the representations learned in the first stage. In our experiments, two models BTC, 2E1D were used as students. In stage 1, using only pseudo-labels, the BTC student achieves over 98 of the teachers performance, while the 2E1D model achieves about 96 across seven standard mir_eval metrics. After a single training run for both students in stage 2, the resulting BTC student model surpasses the traditional supervised learning baseline by 2.5 and the original pre-trained teacher model by 1.55 on average across all metrics. And the resulting 2E1D student model improves from the traditional supervised learning baseline by 3.79 on average and achieves almost the same performance as the teacher. Both cases show the large gains on rare chord qualities.",

Our work is motivated by the application of dynamic predictions in the decision-making process for primary biliary cholangitis patients. For these patients, serial biomarker measurements e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are routinely collected to inform treating physicians of the risk of liver failure and guide clinical decision-making. Two popular statistical approaches to derive dynamic predictions are joint modelling and landmarking. However, recently, machine learning techniques have also been proposed. Each approach has its merits, and no single method exists to outperform all others. Consequently, obtaining the best possible survival estimates is challenging. Therefore, we extend the Super Learner framework to combine dynamic predictions from different models and procedures. Super Learner is an ensemble learning technique that allows users to combine different prediction algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and flexibility. It uses cross-validation and different objective functions of performance e.g., squared loss that suit specific applications to build the optimally weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. In our work, we pay special attention to appropriate objective functions for Super Learner to obtain the most optimal weighted combination of dynamic predictions.

Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering VQA, they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns. To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5 average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0.

We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates up to logarithmic factors. In sharp contrast, networks with non-smooth activations, such as ReLU, lack this adaptivity: their attainable approximation order is strictly limited by depth, and capturing higher-order smoothness requires proportional depth growth. These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality. Technically, our results are established via a constructive approximation framework that produces explicit neural network approximators with carefully controlled parameter norms and model size.

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context e.g., cell type and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input.

Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models Random Forest and XGBoost and one deep learning DL model TabNet were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance tree-based models and attention-based feature attribution TabNet revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features release height, stability category, and downwind distance, treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.",

Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps i.e., reward-based attacks. However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer AAT, which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention MSCSA mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.",

Within each regime, analytic weight predictors momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion.

Finite-difference predictors linear, quadratic succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24 strict acceptance at K5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37 strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34 of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64 in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints.

GOIMDA selects inputs by maximizing their expected influence on a user-specified goal functional, such as test loss, predictive entropy, or the value of an optimizer-recommended design. Leveraging first-order influence functions, we derive a tractable acquisition rule that combines the goal gradient, training-loss curvature, and candidate sensitivity to model parameters. We show theoretically that, for generalized linear models, GOIMDA approximates predictive-entropy minimization up to a correction term accounting for goal alignment and prediction bias, thereby, yielding uncertainty-aware behavior without maintaining a Bayesian posterior. Empirically, across learning tasks including image and text classification and optimization tasks including noisy global optimization benchmarks and neural-network hyperparameter tuning, GOIMDA consistently reaches target performance with substantially fewer labeled samples or function evaluations than uncertainty-based active learning and Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization baselines.",

Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by 7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR 59 to 71 percent than specialized models 63 to 83 percent under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested.

Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agents observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams.

Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps T. We prove that the greedy practical approach of using T1 can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget N and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal T scales as Θlog N resp., ΘN log N12 for the data mixing problem with access to full resp., stochastic gradients.

While deep learning has advanced DNPS, existing models inadequately enforce the fundamental mass consistency constraint, that a predicted peptides mass must match the experimental measured precursor mass. Previous DNPS methods often treat this critical information as a simple input feature or use it in post-processing, leading to numerous implausible predictions that do not adhere to this fundamental physical property. To address this limitation, we introduce DiffuNovo, a novel regressor-guided diffusion model for de novo peptide sequencing that provides explicit peptide-level mass control. Our approach integrates the mass constraint at two critical stages: during training, a novel peptide-level mass loss guides model optimization, while at inference, regressor-based guidance from gradient-based updates in the latent space steers the generation to compel the predicted peptide adheres to the mass constraint. Comprehensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuNovo surpasses state-of-the-art methods in DNPS accuracy. Additionally, as the first DNPS model to employ a diffusion model as its core backbone, DiffuNovo leverages the powerful controllability of diffusion architecture and achieves a significant reduction in mass error, thereby producing much more physically plausible peptides. These innovations represent a substantial advancement toward robust and broadly applicable DNPS. The source code is available in the supplementary material.",

    "text": "Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called impulse control, is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks SNNs have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.",

    "text": "The surrogate gradient descent algorithm enabled spiking neural networks to be trained to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks, an important step in understanding how spikes contribute to neural computations. However, it is unclear the extent to which these algorithms fully explore the space of possible spiking solutions to problems. We investigated whether spiking networks trained with surrogate gradient descent can learn to make use of information that is only encoded in the timing and not the rate of spikes. We constructed synthetic datasets with a range of types of spike timing information interspike intervals, spatio-temporal spike patterns or polychrony, and coincidence codes. We find that surrogate gradient descent training can extract all of these types of information. In more realistic speech-based datasets, both timing and rate information is present. We therefore constructed variants of these datasets in which all rate information is removed, and find that surrogate gradient descent can still perform well. We tested all networks both with and without trainable axonal delays. We find that delays can give a significant increase in performance, particularly for more challenging tasks. To determine what types of spike timing information are being used by the networks trained on the speech-based tasks, we test these networks on time-reversed spikes which perturb spatio-temporal spike patterns but leave interspike intervals and coincidence information unchanged. We find that when axonal delays are not used, networks perform well under time reversal, whereas networks trained with delays perform poorly. This suggests that spiking neural networks with delays are better able to exploit temporal structure. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified speech-based datasets.",

As large language models LLMs have demonstrated superior code generation abilities, recent MILP works are devoted to leveraging the evolutionary computation approaches with LLMs to generate effective primal heuristics. Although the generated heuristics have achieved better solving performance than the hand-crafted ones with little adaptability, the advantage of current LLM-based methods is limited to few MILP instances in one problem class, as they fail to capture the instance characteristics in the problem class the MILP instances generated from the same mathematical model are defined as a problem class. Since MILP instances often differ significantly in structure and feature distribution, the neglect of their characteristics in the evolution process results in poor generalization within the same problem class. To overcome this challenge, we propose a data-algorithm co-evolution framework DHEvo that iteratively selects representative instances and evolves corresponding heuristics. With the initial instance distribution, we develop an LLM-based multi-agent system to generate data-code pairs simultaneously. These data-code pairs are iteratively refined based on their fitness scores, leading to the identification of the most effective heuristic over the entire problem class. Extensive experiments across diverse MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms both human-designed heuristics and existing LLM-based methods.",

The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image. This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced crack detection networks.

Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection structure.

However, the ability of these algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution SCOPE. SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform DCT to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20 increase in efficacy. SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98 decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension is no greater than the corresponding input dimension.

We then test MaCE on Lenia, and through several experiments, we demonstrate that it produces a wide variety of interesting behaviours, starting from the variety and abundance of solitons up to hints of intrinsic evolution in resource-constrained environments. Finally, we showcase the versatility of MaCE by applying it to Neural-CAs and discrete CAs, and discuss promising research directions opened up by this scheme.",

We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations.

We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learnability is closely correlated with carry function structure.

In our simulation, prey and predator RL agents co-evolve their reward functions, including visual rewards for observing prey and predators. While fear-like negative visual rewards for predators often evolved in prey, we also observed cases in which positive rewards for both predators and prey evolved, the latter serving as a social reward for collective grouping. A comparison between different environmental conditions revealed that stronger predator hunting capability promoted stronger fear reward, while less food supply promoted more negative social reward. Moreover, fear did not evolve in response to static pitfalls with non-lethal damage, suggesting that actively hunting predators played an important role in its evolution.

This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate ATP use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties resting potential and leak conductance which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation.

Due to their high temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks SNNs can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work by 2 in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time.

Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI 4DF. This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics CFD simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications.

We take an indirect approach to this question: rather than analyzing the model architecture or training dynamics, we ask why a pretrained Bayes estimator, trained under a prespecified training distribution, can adapt to arbitrary test distributions. Focusing on Poisson EB problems, we identify the existence of universal priors such that training under these priors yields a near-optimal regret bound of widetildeOfrac1n uniformly over all test distributions. Our analysis leverages the classical phenomenon of posterior contraction in Bayesian statistics, showing that the pretrained transformer adapts to unknown test distributions precisely through posterior contraction.

Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs.

For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense and in particular increases its entropy. However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy.

Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent SGD, we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable.

Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in mathbbRd1. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for K and a subgradient oracle for f, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set. Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to exp-fx-hx with closed and convex f and h. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with f modeling data fidelity and h encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of h to constrained sampling in mathbbRd1, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in mathbbRd2, on which we apply a proximal sampler.

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2. Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay S2D, a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that S2D significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with S2D achieve up to 7 improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4 gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",

    "text": "Data augmentation is one of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization in modern machine learning, often justified by its ability to promote invariance to label-irrelevant transformations. However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: 1 a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, 2 a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and 3 a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.",

Personalized Federated Learning PFL mitigates this issue by considering client-specific models. A widely adopted approach in PFL decomposes neural networks into a shared feature extractor and client-specific heads. While effective, this design induces a fundamental tradeoff: deep or expressive shared components hinder personalization, whereas large local heads exacerbate overfitting under limited per-client data. Most existing methods rely on rigid, shallow heads, and therefore fail to navigate this tradeoff in a principled manner. In this work, we propose a boosting-inspired framework that enables a smooth control of this tradeoff. Instead of training a single personalized model, we construct an ensemble of T models for each client. Across boosting iterations, the depth of the personalized component are progressively increased, while its effective complexity is systematically controlled via low-rank factorization or width shrinkage. This design simultaneously limits overfitting and substantially reduces per-client bias by allowing increasingly expressive personalization. We provide theoretical analysis that establishes generalization bounds with favorable dependence on the average local sample size and the total number of clients. Specifically, we prove that the complexity of the shared layers is effectively suppressed, while the dependence on the boosting horizon T is controlled through parameter reduction. Notably, we provide a novel nonlinear generalization guarantee for decoupled PFL models.

Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law FSL framework introduced in Li et al. 2025a provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model LLM pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions.

We study this procedure in overparameterized linear regression: an initial estimator is trained on noisy labels, and each subsequent iterate is trained on fresh covariates with noiseless pseudo-labels from the previous model. In the high-dimensional regime, we derive deterministic-equivalent recursions for the prediction risk and effective noise across iterations, and prove that the empirical quantities concentrate sharply around these limits. The recursion separates two competing forces: a systematic component that grows with iteration due to progressive signal forgetting, and a stochastic component that decays due to denoising via repeated data-dependent projections. Their interaction yields a U-shaped test-risk curve and an optimal early-stopping time. In spiked covariance models, iteration further acts as an iteration-dependent spectral filter that preserves strong eigendirections while suppressing weaker ones, inducing an implicit form of soft feature selection distinct from ridge regression. Finally, we propose an iterated generalized cross-validation criterion and prove its uniform consistency for estimating the risk along the self-training trajectory, enabling fully data-driven selection of the stopping time and regularization.

While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of distilled models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble. An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model superclusters, as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state.

Specifically, we formally extend classical NTK theory Jacot et al., 2018 to non-random i.e., pretrained initializations and provide a convergence guarantee for attention-based fine-tuning. One key insight provided by the theory is that the convergence rate with respect to sample size is closely linked to the eigenvalue decay rate of the empirical kernel matrix induced by the NTK.

As an immediate consequence, we obtain tail bounds on the error of SA iterates at any time.

Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin a support gap Δ certified by KKT multipliers, entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as exp-ΩΔvarepsilon, while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperatureregularization parameter varepsilon. This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.

Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler KL divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the coding rate -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the firing rate -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder P-VAE -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of sparse coding as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient β and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing β monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations.

However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location UniFL, a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.",

These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone.

This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric data noise from epistemic model variability effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness.

Realizing the problem, several recent works have focused on post-hoc corrections; however, existing methods either rely on weak notions of calibration such as PIT uniformity or impose restrictive parametric assumptions on the nature of the error. To address these limitations, we propose a novel nonparametric re-calibration algorithm based on conditional kernel mean embeddings, capable of correcting calibration error without restrictive modeling assumptions.

Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an ellp penalty. Inspired by the interpolating information criterion, our framework decomposes the selection penalty into a regularization term quantifying the alignment of the regularizer and the interpolator and a geometric sharpness term on the interpolating manifold quantifying the effect of local perturbations, yielding a tradeoff analogous to bias-variance. Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for ellp regularizers where p ge 2.

In these settings, data-dependent weights are first computed to satisfy distributional constraints, such as covariate balance, before the final parameter of interest is estimated.

Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, textbfdecision-theoretic view of steganography. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content present within a steganographic signal, and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised mathcalV-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the textbfsteganographic gap -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.",

The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise. We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information GMI, with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoders scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment confirms the bottleneck is the decoders scoring rule, not the encoder or projection.

We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we i sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, ii score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model PRM, and iii stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive AR model solver to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration diffusion from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8 across six math and coding tasks.

This stems from the combinatorial contradiction phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix Rejection Mixing, a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a tokens representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a 2-8 times inference speedup without any quality degradation.",

However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine TCM clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs KG with chains of thought CoT. TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned SFT LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning.

As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting NLD-P as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol.

We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: a Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. b Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity.

However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.",

    "text": "Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields e.g., reviews or clinical notes alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models MDLMs. TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.",

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval SSR, a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to 13 points on AIME25 and 5 points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping CPAS to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation LAGR to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity.

We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model ITM into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs with explicit thinking and response segments and ITMs answers-only. We introduce RAIN-Merging Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging, a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRMs structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning  general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality.

To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers RNN-T. Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal style from linguistic content, which enhances the models capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR Hanzi and Pinyin. We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks.

Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce.

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.",

    "text": "ElI5 how does the existence of lead directly disprove the earth isnt only 4000 years old?. I recently saw a screenshot of a Facebook post of someone declaring the earth is only 4000 years old and someone replying that the existence of lead disproves it bc the halflife of uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years old. I get this is a setup post, but I just dont understand how lead proves its not. The only way for lead to exist is to decay from uranium-238? Like how do we know this? Just because it does eventually decay into lead means that all lead that exist HAS to come from it? Edit: I am not trying to argue the creationist side of the original screenshot of a post I saw. Im trying to understand the response to that creationist side. I have since learned that the response in the oop conveniently leaves out that its not the existence of all lead but specific types of lead that can explain that the earth is not only 4000 years old through the process of radioactive decay and the existence of specific types of lead in specific conditions. Its also hilarious to see the amount of people jumping in to essentially say creationist are dumb and you are dumb to even interact with them and completely ignoring the fact that Im questioning a comment left on a post that I saw in a screenshot of on a completely different platform. And also thank you to everyone taking the time to explain that the commenter in oop gave a less than truthful explanation and then explaining the truth.",

    "text": "ELI5 What does the second law of thermodynamics actually mean, and how does it relate to evolution?. My chemistry class is just me and my teacher, and we only meet like once a week. She wants me to write a paragraph on my own personal thoughts about evolution since it is from a Christian academy I already know how people on this site feel about religion, please dont rant about it, so naturally the idea of how evolution works is something that would get brought up. She wants to know my personal thoughts on it, but I dont really understand it enough to write one as of right now. The books say the second law suggests that things only remain the same amount of disorder or get more disordered, but I dont really understand what that means. Ill hopefully look more into the second law before reading comments, but I am curious on what the second law actually means since she expected me to look into it. My teacher brought up how the second law of thermodynamics could disprove the current ideas we have of evolution. She also said that evolution still could be plausible, but the existing theories are mainly disproven by the second law. Is evolution really disproven by thermodynamics? I feel like with how heavily discussed the idea is that it wouldnt make sense. We already know creatures relate to each other and that creatures adapt to environments. I dont understand how this law relates to the idea of evolution or how it disproves the idea. Another thing that she said that confused me was that it wouldnt make sense if humans came from chimpanzees since chimpanzees still exist. I said I heard that they actually came from a common ancestor. Is the fact that there is more primitive versions of a species that exist proof they couldnt have had a common ancestor or come from one another?",

But how does that happen between the time giraffes are eating, and the birth of new giraffes? How does their biology decide to birth a giraffe with a longer neck?

No hardcoded behaviours, no reward functions. - they could evolve in any direction.pPure Python, stdlib only  brains evolve through survival and reproduction, not backprop. Therex27;s a Next.js dashboard quot;Werld Observatoryquot; that gives you a live-view: population dynamics, brain complexity, species trajectories, a narrative story generator, live world map.pthought this would be more fun as an open-source project!pcanx27;t wait to see where this could evolve - ix27;ll be in the comments and on the repo.pa href relnofollow",
